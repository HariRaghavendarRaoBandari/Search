CATEGORICAL ACTIONS ON UNIPOTENT REPRESENTATIONS

OF FINITE CLASSICAL GROUPS

O. DUDAS, M. VARAGNOLO, E. VASSEROT

Abstract. We review the categorical representation of a Kac-Moody algebra on
unipotent representations of ﬁnite unitary groups in non-deﬁning characteristic
given in [18], using Harish-Chandra induction and restriction. Then, we extend this
construction to ﬁnite reductive groups of types B or C in non-deﬁning characteristic.
We show that the decategoriﬁed representation is isomorphic to a direct sum of
level 2 Fock spaces. We deduce that the Harish-Chandra branching graph coincides
with the crystal graph of these Fock spaces. We also obtain derived equivalences
between blocks, yielding Brou´e’s abelian defect group conjecture for unipotent ℓ-
blocks at linear primes ℓ.

Introduction

Let G be a connected algebraic group deﬁned over a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq. The ﬁnite
group G = G(Fq) of its Fq-rational points is a ﬁnite reductive group. The irreducible
representations of G over ﬁelds of characteristic ℓ prime to q fall into Harish-Chandra

4

O. DUDAS, M. VARAGNOLO, E. VASSEROT

series, which are deﬁned in terms of Harish-Chandra induction RG
L and restriction
∗RG
L from proper Levi subgroups L of G. The isomorphism classes in each series
are parametrized by the simple modules of the ramiﬁed Hecke algebras, which are
realized as the endomorphism algebras of the Harish-Chandra induction of cuspidal
representations. Therefore, the classiﬁcation of isomorphism classes of irreducible
representations of G can be reduced to the following two problems :

(a) classiﬁcation of the cuspidal irreducible representations,
(b) determination of the ramiﬁed Hecke algebras.

This was achieved by Lusztig in [54] when ℓ = 0 but it remains open for represen-
tations in positive characteristic for most of the ﬁnite reductive groups. By results of
Geck-Hiss-Malle [32], we know however that the ramiﬁed Hecke algebras are indeed
Hecke algebras of ﬁnite type, only the parameters of the deformation are unknown
in general.

When G is a classical group, it turns out that most of the structure of the rami-
ﬁed Hecke algebras does not depend on the corresponding unipotent cuspidal repre-
sentations. This suggests to rather study the endomorphism algebra of the Harish-
Chandra induction functor RG
L rather than the endomorphism algebra of the induced
representation. This was already achieved in [10] for G = GLn(q). Our goal is to
extend Chuang-Rouquier’s approach to other classical groups.

In the ﬁrst part of this paper we focus on the case of ﬁnite unitary groups GUn(q),
reviewing our previous work [18], whereas in the last part we deal with the case of
groups of types B or C. We will work with both ordinary representations (character-
istic zero) and modular representations in non-deﬁning characteristic (characteristic
ℓ prime to q). More precisely, the ﬁeld of coeﬃcients R of the representations will
be an extension of either Qℓ or Fℓ.

Let Gn(q) be one of the families of ﬁnite classical groups among GU2n(q), GU2n+1(q),
Sp2n(q) and SO2n+1(q). Using the tower of inclusion of groups · · · ⊂ Gn(q) ⊂
Gn+1(q) ⊂ · · · one can form the abelian category of unipotent representations

UR :=Mn>0

Gn(q) -umod .

Furthermore, under mild assumption on ℓ, we can modify the Harish-Chandra in-
duction and restriction functors to obtain an adjoint pair (E, F ) of functors on UR.
The functor F corresponds to a Harish-Chandra induction from Gn(q) to Gn+1(q)
whereas E corresponds to the restriction. Note that only speciﬁc Levi subgroups are
considered, and we must work with a variation of the usual Harish-Chandra theory
(the weak Harish-Chandra theory) introduced in [36].

In this framework, problem (a) amounts to ﬁnding the modules V such that EV =
0 and problem (b) is about the structure of EndG(F mV ) for such cuspidal modules V .

5

As mentioned before, most of the structure of this endomorphism algebra is already
contained in End(F m). In §4.2 and §6.2, we construct natural transformations X of
F and T of F 2 which endow End(F m) with a morphism from an aﬃne Hecke algebra
Hqδ

m−1 with parameter qδ where the integer δ is determined as follows

m of type A(1)

• δ = 2 if Gn(q) is GU2n(q) or GU2n+1(q),
• δ = 1 if Gn(q) is Sp2n(q) or SO2n+1(q).

Back to our original problem, the evaluation at a cuspidal module V provides a
natural map Hqδ
m → EndG(F mV ). Then, we prove that this map induces a natural
isomorphism between EndG(F mV ) and a level 2 cyclotomic quotient of Hqδ
m whose
parameters are naturally attached to V , see Theorems 4.8 and 6.5.

Next, we prove that the eigenvalues of X belong to
• I2 = (−q)Z if Gn(q) is GU2n(q) or GU2n+1(q),
• I1 = qZ ⊔ (−qZ) if Gn(q) is Sp2n(q) or SO2n+1(q).

Then, we can form a Lie algebra g corresponding to the quiver with vertices Iδ and
arrows given by multiplication by qδ. When working in characteristic zero, the Lie
algebra g is isomorphic to two copies of slZ. In positive characteristic ℓ prime to q it
will depend on whether −q is a power of qδ. This reﬂects the diﬀerence of behaviour
for unipotent representations when working at linear or unitary primes. To explain
this we denote by d, e, f the order of q2, −q and q modulo ℓ. Two situations occur:
• ℓ is a linear prime if Gn(q) is GU2n(q) or GU2n+1(q) and e is even (then
e = 2d and −q /∈ q2Z mod ℓ), or if Gn(q) is Sp2n(q) or SO2n+1(q) and f is odd

• ℓ is a unitary prime if Gn(q) is GU2n(q) or GU2n+1(q) and e is odd (then
e = d and −q ≡ (q2)(e+1)/2 mod ℓ), or if Gn(q) is Sp2n(q) or SO2n+1(q) and f
is even (then f = 2d and −q ≡ qd+1 mod ℓ). In that case g is isomorphic to

(then f = d and −q /∈ qZ mod ℓ). In that case g is a subalgebra of (bsld)⊕2;
bslf /δ.

In each case we prove that the representation datum (E, F, X, T ) induces a categor-
ical action of g on UR. See Theorems 4.11 and 4.17 for ﬁnite unitary groups, and
Theorems 6.11, 6.12 and 6.18 for groups of types B and C.

In particular, let E =L Ei and F =L Fi be the decomposition of the functors

into generalized i-eigenspaces for X. Then [Ei], [Fi] act as the Chevalley generators
of g on the Grothendieck group [UR] of UR and many problems on UR have a Lie-
theoretic counterpart. For example,

• weakly cuspidal modules correspond to highest weight vectors,
• the decomposition of UR into weak Harish-Chandra series corresponds to the
decomposition of the g-module [UR] into a direct sum of irreducible highest
weight modules,

6

O. DUDAS, M. VARAGNOLO, E. VASSEROT

• the parameters of the ramiﬁed Hecke algebra attached to a weakly cuspidal

unipotent module V are given by the weight of [V ],

• the blocks of UR, or equivalently the unipotent ℓ-blocks, correspond to the weight
spaces for the action of g (inside a Harish-Chandra series if ℓ is a linear prime).
Such observations were already used in other situations, e.g., for cyclotomic rational
double aﬃne Hecke algebras.

For this dictionary to be eﬃcient one needs to determine the g-module structure
on [UR]. This is done in §4.5 and §6.5 by looking at the action of [Ei] and [Fi] on
the basis of [UR] formed by unipotent characters and their ℓ-reduction, which play a
role similar to the role of the standard modules in the categoriﬁcations of cyclotomic
rational double aﬃne Hecke algebras mentioned above. On this basis the action can
be made explicit, and we prove that there is a natural g-module isomorphism

[UR] ∼−→Mt>0

F(Qt)

between the Grothendieck group of UR and a direct sum of level 2 Fock spaces
F(Qt), each of which corresponds to an ordinary Harish-Chandra series. Through
this isomorphism, the basis of unipotent characters (or their ℓ-reduction) is sent to
the standard monomial basis.

Our original motivation for constructing a categorical action of g on UR comes from
a conjecture of Gerber-Hiss-Jacon [36] for ﬁnite unitary groups, which predicts an
explicit relation between the Harish-Chandra branching graph and the crystal graph

of the Fock spaces Lt>0 F(Qt) when e is odd. See also [37]. Using our categorical

methods and the unitriangularity of the decomposition matrix we obtained in [18]
a complete proof of the conjecture, see Theorem 4.21. We extend here this result
to groups of type B and C (see Theorem 6.22). Note however that in order to do
so, we must rely on a conjecture of Geck concerning the unitriangular shape of the
decomposition matrices that we have recalled in Conjecture 6.21.

A similar result can be deduced when ℓ is a linear prime. However, in that case,
the situation is already well-understood by the work of Gruber-Hiss [39] on classical
groups. The case where ℓ is unitary is considered as more challenging and our
categoriﬁcation techniques give the ﬁrst major result in that direction since the case
of GLn(q) was solved by Dipper-Du [16]. This solves completely the problem of
classiﬁcation of irreducible unipotent modules for unitary groups and groups of types
B or C mentioned at the beginning of the introduction, and yields a combinatorial
description of the weak Harish-Chandra series.

For ﬁnite unitary groups, another categorical construction can be used in order to
get the usual (non weak) Harish-Chandra series, by adapting some techniques from
[62]. It relies on a categoriﬁcation of the Heinsenberg representation of level 2 on the

7

Fock spaces F(Qt) mentioned above. We explain this in §5. This yields a complete
classiﬁcation of the cuspidal unipotent modules, as explained in Theorem 5.10 and
§5.5.3 (and a computation of the parameters of all ramiﬁed Hecke algebras).

By the work of Chuang-Rouquier, categorical actions also provide derived equiva-
lences between weight spaces. In our situation, these weight spaces are exactly the
unipotent ℓ-blocks and we obtain many derived equivalences between blocks with
the same local structure. Together with Livesey’s construction of good blocks in the
linear prime case, we deduce a proof of Brou´e’s abelian defect group conjecture see
Theorems 4.19 (or [18]) and 6.20 (which does not rely on Conjecture 6.21).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 1 we set our notations and recall basic
facts on categorical actions, perfect bases and derived equivalences. In Section 2 we
introduce the Fock spaces, which are certain integrable representations of Kac-Moody
algebras. They have a crystal graph which can be deﬁned combinatorially. In Section
3 we recall standard results on unipotent representations of ﬁnite reductive groups
in non-deﬁning characteristic. In Section 4 we recall the categorical representation
on the unipotent modules of unitary groups given in [18], and the main applications
proved there. In Section 5 we explain the role of the Heisenberg categorical action and
its relation with Harish-Chandra series. The results here are new and were announced
in [18]. Section 6 deals with the categorical representation on the unipotent modules
of groups of type B,C and its applications to weak Harish-Chandra series and derived
equivalences. The results in this ﬁnal section are new.

1. Categorical representations

Throughout this section, R will denote a noetherian commutative domain (with

unit).

1.1. Rings and categories.

An R-category C is an additive category enriched over the tensor category of R-
modules. All the functors F on C will be assumed to be R-linear. Given such a
functor, we denote by 1F or sometimes F the identity element in the endomorphism
ring End(F ). The identity functor on C will be denoted by by 1C . A composition
of functors E and F is written as EF , while a composition of morphisms of functors
(or natural transformations) ψ and φ is written as ψ ◦ φ. We say that C is Hom-
ﬁnite if the Hom spaces are ﬁnitely generated over R. If the category C is abelian
or exact, we denote by [C ] the complexiﬁed Grothendieck group and by Irr(C ) the
set of isomorphism classes of simple objects of C . The class of an object M of C in
the Grothendieck group is denoted by [M]. An exact endofunctor F of C induces a
linear map on [C ] which we will denote by [F ].

8

O. DUDAS, M. VARAGNOLO, E. VASSEROT

Assume that C is Hom-ﬁnite. Given an object M ∈ C we set H (M) = EndC (M)op.
It is an R-algebra which is ﬁnitely generated as an R-module. We denote by FM the
functor FM = HomC (M, −) : C −→ H (M) -mod .

Assume now that C = H -mod, where H is an R-algebra with 1 which is ﬁnitely
generated and free over R. We abbreviate Irr(H) = Irr(C ). Given an homomorphism
R → S, we can form the S-category SC = SH -mod where SH = S ⊗R H. Given
another R-category C ′ as above and an exact functor F : C → C ′, then F is
represented by a projective object P ∈ C . We set SF = HomSC (SP, −) : SC →
SC ′.

Let K be the ﬁeld of fractions of R, A ⊂ R be a subring which is integrally
closed in K and θ : R → k be a ring homomorphism into a ﬁeld k such that k
is the ﬁeld of fractions of θ(A). If kH is split, then there is a decomposition map
dθ : [KH -mod] −→ [kH -mod], see e.g. [33, sec. 3.1] for more details.

1.2. Kac-Moody algebras of type A and their representations.

The Lie algebras which will act on the categories we will study will always be ﬁnite
e−1. They will arise from quivers of

sums of Kac-Moody algebras of type A∞ or A(1)
the same type.

1.2.1. Lie algebra associated with a quiver. Let v ∈ R× and I ⊂ R×. We assume
that v 6= 1 and that I is stable by multiplication by v and v−1 with ﬁnitely many
orbits. To the pair (I, v) we associate a quiver I(v) (also denoted by I) as follows:

• the vertices of I(v) are the elements of I;
• the arrows of I(v) are i → iv for i ∈ I.

Since I is assumed to be stable by multiplication by v and v−1, such a quiver is the
disjoint union of quivers of type A∞ if v is not a root of unity, or of cyclic quivers of
type A(1)

e−1 if v is a primitive e-th root of 1.

The quiver I(v) deﬁnes a symmetric generalized Cartan matrix A = (aij)i,j∈I with
aii = 2, aij = −1 when i → j or j → i and aij = 0 otherwise. To this Cartan matrix
one can associate the (derived) Kac-Moody algebra g′
I over C, which has Chevalley
generators ei, fi for i ∈ I, subject to the usual relations.

More generally, let (XI, X∨
with A, i.e., we assume that

I , h•, •iI, {αi}i∈I, {α∨

i }i∈I) be a Cartan datum associated

I are free abelian groups,

• XI and X∨
• the simple coroots {α∨
• for each i ∈ I there exists a fundamental weight Λi ∈ XI satisfying hα∨

i } are linearly independent in X∨
I ,

j , ΛiiI = δij

for all j ∈ I,

• h•, •iI : X∨

I × XI −→ Z is a perfect pairing such that hα∨

j , αiiI = aij.

9

I =L Zα∨

i be the coroot lattice and PI =L ZΛi be the weight lattice. Then,

Let Q∨
the Kac-Moody algebra gI corresponding to this datum is the Lie algebra generated
by the Chevalley generators ei, fi for i ∈ I and the Cartan algebra h = C ⊗ X∨
I . An
element h ∈ h acts by [h, ei] = hh, αiiei. The Lie algebra g′
I is the derived subalgebra
[gI, gI].
Example 1.1. When I = vZ two cases arise.
(a) If I is inﬁnite, then g′

I is isomorphic to slZ, the Lie algebra of traceless matrices

with ﬁnitely many non-zero entries.

(b) If v has ﬁnite order e, then I is isomorphic to a cyclic quiver of type A(1)
e−1.
We can form X∨ = Q∨ ⊕Z∂ and X = P ⊕Zδ with h∂, Λii = 0, h∂, αii = δi1

and δ = Pi∈I αi. The pairing is non-degenerate, and gI is isomorphic to the

Kac-Moody algebra

An explicit isomorphism sends evi (resp. fvi) to the matrix Ei,i+1 ⊗ 1 (resp.
Ei+1,i ⊗ 1) if i 6= e and e1 (resp. f1) to Ee,1 ⊗ t (resp. E1,e ⊗ t−1). Via this iso-
i , and the derived algebra

bsle = sle(C) ⊗ C[t, t−1] ⊕ Cc ⊕ C∂.
mophism the central element c corresponds toPi∈I α∨
I to esle = sle(C) ⊗ C[t, t−1] ⊕ Cc.

To avoid cumbersome notation, we may write g = gI, P = PI, Q∨ = Q∨

I , etc.

g′

when there is no risk of confusion.

1.2.2. Integrable representations. Let V be a g-module. Given ω ∈ X, the ω-weight
space of V is Vω = {v ∈ V | α∨ · v = hα∨, ωi v, ∀α∨ ∈ Q∨}. We denote by Oint the
category of integrable highest weight modules, i.e. g-modules V satisfying

• the action of ei and fi is locally nilpotent for all i ∈ I,

• V =Lω∈X Vω and dim Vω < ∞ for all ω ∈ X,
• there exists a ﬁnite set F ⊂ X such that wt(V ) ⊂ F +Pi∈I Z60αi.

Let X+ = {ω ∈ X | hα∨
i , ωi ∈ N for all i ∈ I} be the set of integral dominant
weights. Given Λ ∈ X+, we denote by L(Λ) the simple integrable highest weight
module with highest weight Λ.

1.2.3. Quantized enveloping algebras. Let u be a formal variable and A = C[u, u−1].
Let Uu(g) be the quantized enveloping algebra over C(u). Let UA(g) ⊂ Uu(g) be
Lusztig’s divided power version of Uu(g). For each integral weight Λ the module
L(Λ) admits a deformed version Lu(Λ) over Uu(g) and an integral form LA(Λ) which
is the UA(g)-submodule of Lu(Λ) generated by the highest weight vector |Λi. Let
Oint
u be the category consisting of the Uu(g)-modules which are (possibly inﬁnite)
direct sums of Lu(Λ)’s. If Vu ∈ Oint
u , then its integral form VA is the corresponding

10

O. DUDAS, M. VARAGNOLO, E. VASSEROT

sum of the modules LA(Λ). It depends on the choice of a family of highest weight
vectors of the constituents of Vu.

1.3. Categorical representations on abelian categories.

In this section we recall from [10, 59] the notion of a categorical action of g. It
consists of the data of functors Ei, Fi lifting the Chevalley generators ei, fi of g,

together with an action of an aﬃne Hecke algebra on (Li∈I Fi)m.

1.3.1. Aﬃne Hecke algebras and representation data. Let C be an abelian R-category
and v ∈ R×.

Deﬁnition 1.2. A representation datum on C with parameter v is a tuple (E, F, X, T )
where E, F are bi-adjoint functors C → C and X ∈ End(F )×, T ∈ End(F 2) are
endomorphisms of functors satisfying the following conditions:
(a) 1F T ◦ T 1F ◦ 1F T = T 1F ◦ 1F T ◦ T 1F ,
(b) (T + 1F 2) ◦ (T − v1F 2) = 0,
(c) T ◦ (1F X) ◦ T = vX1F .

For m > 1, let Hv
by T1, . . . , Tm−1, X ±1
Hv

This deﬁnition can also be formulated in terms of actions of aﬃne Hecke algebras.
R,m be the aﬃne Hecke algebra of type Am−1 over R. It is generated
m subject to the well-known relations. We will also set

1 , . . . , X ±1

R,0 = R.
Given (E, F ) a pair of biadjoint functors, and X ∈ End(F ), T ∈ End(F 2), the
tuple (E, F, X, T ) is a representation datum if and only if for each m ∈ N, the map

φF m : Hv

R,m −→ End(F m)
Xk
Tl

7−→ 1F m−kX1F k−1
7−→ 1F m−l−1T 1F l−1

is a well-deﬁned R-algebra homomorphism.

1.3.2. Categorical representations. We assume now that R is a ﬁeld and that C is
Hom-ﬁnite. We ﬁx a pair (I, v) as in §1.2 and we denote by g = gI the Lie algebra
associated to that pair.

Deﬁnition 1.3 ([59]). A g-representation on C consists of a representation datum
Cω. For each i ∈ I, let Fi,
Ei be the generalized i-eigenspaces of X acting on F, E respectively. We assume in
addition that

(E, F, X, T ) on C and of a decomposition C = Lω∈X
(a) F =Li∈I Fi and E =Li∈I Ei,

(b) the action of [Ei] and [Fi] for i ∈ I endow [C ] with a structure of integrable

g-module such that [C ]ω = [Cω],

11

(c) Ei(Cω) ⊂ Cω+αi and Fi(Cω) ⊂ Cω−αi.

We say that the tuple (E, F, X, T ) and the decomposition C = Lω∈X

g-categoriﬁcation of the integrable g-module [C ].

Cω is a

1.4. Minimal categorical representations.

For most of the results in the rest of Section 1 we will assume that R is a ﬁeld and

that I is ﬁnite. In particular v ∈ R× will be a root of unity.

Let m > 0, v ∈ R× and Hv

ﬁx a tuple Q = (Q1, . . . , Ql) in (R×)l. The cyclotomic Hecke algebra HQ; v

This categorical representation is called the minimal categorical gI-representation

of highest weight ΛQ.

The gI-modules we are interested in are direct sums of various irreducible highest
weight modules L(ΛQ). Let (I, v) as in §1.2, and g = gI be a corresponding Kac-
Moody algebra. Let (E, F, X, T ) be a g-representation on an abelian R-category C .
We want to relate C to minimal categorical gI -representations. To do that, recall that
for any m > 0 we have an R-algebra homomorphism φF m : HQ; v

1.5. Crystals.

We start by a review of Kashiwara’s theory of perfect bases and crystals. We will

be working with the Kac-Moody algebra g coming from a pair (I, v) as in §1.2.

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 1.6. An abstract crystal is a set B together with maps wt : B → P, εi,

ϕi : B → Z ⊔ {−∞} and eei,efi : B → B ⊔ {0} for all i ∈ I satisfying the following

properties:

Note that by (a), the map ϕi is entirely determined by εi and wt. We may therefore

1.6. Perfect bases.

The crystals that we will consider in this paper all come from particular bases of
gI-modules called perfect bases. Let us deﬁne them. Let V ∈ Oint be an integrable
highest weight gI-module. For each i ∈ I and x ∈ V we deﬁne

ℓi(x) = max{k ∈ N | ek

i x 6= 0} = min{k ∈ N | ek+1

i x = 0}

with the convention that ℓi(0) = −∞. For each integer k, we also consider the vector
spaces

(c) if eib = eib′ 6= 0 for b, b′ ∈ B, then b = b′.

Any g-module in Oint admits a perfect basis. More precisely, we have the following.

Proposition 1.8. If V is an integrable g-module in Oint with a quantum deformation
Vu, then the specialization at u = 1 of an upper global basis of Vu is a perfect basis
of V .
(cid:3)

To any categorical representation we associate a perfect basis as in [61, prop. 6.2].
More precisely, let R be a ﬁeld (of any characteristic) and consider a g-representation
on an abelian artinian R-category C . Then, for each i ∈ I we deﬁne the maps

eEi : Irr(C ) → Irr(C ) ⊔ {0},
eFi : Irr(C ) → Irr(C ) ⊔ {0},

[L] 7→ [soc(Ei(L))],

[L] 7→ [hd(Fi(L))].

We now recall how to construct an abstract crystal from a perfect basis B. We set

Proposition 1.9. The tuple(cid:0)Irr(C ),eEi,eFi(cid:1) deﬁnes a perfect basis of [C ].
eei = ei. For all b ∈ B we set efib = b′ if eib′ = b for some b′ ∈ B, and 0 otherwise.
Then it follows easily from the deﬁnition that (B,eei,efi, ℓi, wt) is an abstract crystal.

We ﬁnish this section with a result which will be important to identify the crystal
obtained by the categoriﬁcation with the crystal of some Fock space. For each i ∈ I
and k ∈ N, we set B6 k = V 6k ∩ B and B6 k

isomorphism B ∼→ B′.

(cid:3)

1.7. Derived equivalences.

Given V an integrable g-module and i ∈ I, one can consider the action of the simple
reﬂection si = exp(−fi) exp(ei) exp(−fi) on V . For each weight ω ∈ X, this action
maps a weight space Vω to Vsi(ω) with si(ω) = ω −hα∨
i , ωiαi. If C is a categoriﬁcation
of V , then it restricts to an sl2(C)-categoriﬁcation in the sense of Chuang-Rouquier.
In particular, the simple objects are weight vectors for the categorical sl2(C)-action.
Thus, the theory of Chuang-Rouquier can be applied and [10, thm. 6.6] implies that
si can be lifted to a derived equivalence Θi of C .

Theorem 1.11. Assume that R is a ﬁeld. Let (E, F, X, T ) be a representation of g
in an abelian R-category C , and i ∈ I. Then there exists a derived self-equivalence
: Db(Cω) ∼−→ Db(Csi(ω)) for all
Θi of C which restricts to derived equivalences Θi
weightn ω ∈ X. Furthermore, [Θi] = si as a linear map of [C ].
(cid:3)

2. Representations on Fock spaces

Let R be a noetherian commutative domain with unit. As in §1.2, we ﬁx an
element v ∈ R× and a subset I of R× which is stable by multiplication by v and v−1.
We explained in §1.2.1 how one can associate a Lie algebra g = gI to this data. In
this section we recall the construction of (charged) Fock spaces which are particular
integrable representations of g.

2.1. Combinatorics of l-partitions.

Pn the set of partitions of n and by P =Fn

2.1.1. Partitions and l-partitions. A partition of n is a non-increasing sequence of
non-negative integers λ = (λ1 > λ2 > · · · ) whose terms add up to n. We denote by
Pn be the set of all partitions. Given
a partition λ, we write |λ| for the weight of λ. We associate to λ = (λ1, λ2, . . . ) the
Young diagram Y (λ) deﬁned by Y (λ) = {(x, y) ∈ Z>0 × Z>0 | y 6 λx}. It may
be visualised by an array of boxes in left justiﬁed rows with λx boxes in the x-th
row. If λ, µ are partitions of n then we write λ > µ if for all n > i > 1 we have
j=1 µj. This relation deﬁnes a partial order on P called the dominance

order. Let λ∗ denote the partition dual (or conjugate) to λ.

j=1 λj >Pi

16

P l

An l-partition of n is an l-tuple of partitions whose weights add up to n. We
denote by P l
n the set of all
l-partitions. The Young diagram of the l-partition λ = (λ1, . . . , λl) is the set Y (λ) =

n be the set of l-partitions of n and by P l = Fn

p=1 Y (λp) × {p}. Its weight is the integer |λ| =Pp |λp|.
Fl

2.1.2. Residues and content. We ﬁx Q = (Q1, . . . , Ql) ∈ I l. Let λ be an l-partition
and A = (x, y, p) be a node in Y (λ). The (Q, v)-shifted residue of the node A is the
element of I given by res(A, Q)I = vy−xQp. Let ni(λ, Q)I be the number of nodes of
(Q, v)-shifted residue i in Y (λ). If λ, µ are l-partitions such that |µ| = |λ|+1 we write
res(µ − λ, Q)I = i if Y (µ) is obtained by adding a node of (Q, v)-shifted residue i to
Y (λ). A charge of the tuple Q = (Q1, . . . , Ql) is an l-tuple of integers s = (s1, . . . , sl)
such that Qp = vsp for all p = 1, . . . , l. Conversely, given I ⊂ R× and v ∈ R× as in
§1.2, any ℓ-tuple of integers s ∈ Zl deﬁnes a tuple Q = (vs1, . . . , vsl) with charge s.
The s-shifted content of the box A = (x, y, p) is the integer cts(A) = sp + y − x. It
is related to the residue of A by the formula res(A, Q)I = vcts(A). We will also write
p(A) = p. We will call charged l-partition a pair (µ, s) in P l × Zl.

2.1.3. l-cores and l-quotients. We start with the case l = 1. The set of β-numbers of
a charged partition (λ, d) ∈ P ×Z is the set given by βd(λ) = {λu+d+1−u | u > 1}.
The charged partition (λ, d) is uniquely determined by the set βd(λ).

For any positive integer e, an e-hook of (λ, d) is a pair (x, x + e) such that x + e ∈
βd(λ) and x 6∈ βd(λ). Removing the e-hook (x, x + e) corresponds to replacing x + e
with x in βd(λ). We say that the charged partition (λ, d) is an e-core if it does not
have any e-hook. This does not depend on d.

Next, we construct a bijection τl : P × Z → P l × Zl. It takes the pair (λ, d)
to (µ, s), where µ = (µ1, . . . , µl) is an l-partition and s = (s1, . . . , sl) is a l-tuple in
Zl(d) = {s ∈ Zl
| s1 + · · · + sl = d}. The bijection is uniquely determined by the

relation βd(λ) =Fl

p=1(cid:0)p − l + lβsp(µp)(cid:1).

The bijection τl takes the pair (λ, 0) to (λ[l], λ[l]), where λ[l] is the l-quotient of λ
and λ[l] lies in Zl(0). Since λ is an l-core if and only if λ[l] = ∅, this bijection identiﬁes
the set of l-cores and Zl(0). We deﬁne the l-weight wl(λ) := |λ[l]| of the partition λ
to be the weight of its l-quotient.

We will mostly consider the bijection τl for l = 2. In particular, a 2-core is either
∆0 = ∅ or a triangular partition ∆t = (t, t − 1, . . . , 1) with t ∈ N. We abbreviate
σt = (∆t)[2], and we write σt = (σ1, σ2). We have

(2.1)

σt =((cid:0) − t/2, t/2(cid:1)

(cid:0)(1 + t)/2, −(1 + t)/2(cid:1)

if t is even,
if t is odd.

For each bipartition µ, let ̟t(µ) denote the unique partition with 2-quotient µ and
2-core ∆t. Thus, the bijection τ2 maps (̟t(µ), 0) to the pair (µ, σt).

17

2.2. Fock spaces.

Let Q = (Q1, . . . , Ql) ∈ I l. It deﬁnes an integral dominant weight ΛQ =Pl

For a reference for the results presented in this section, see for example [65], [66].
p=1 ΛQp ∈
P+. The Fock space F(Q)I is the C-vector space with basis {|λ, QiI | λ ∈ P l} called
the standard monomial basis, and action of ei, fi for all i ∈ I given by

(2.2)

fi(|λ, QiI) =Xµ

|µ, QiI,

ei(|µ, QiI) =Xλ

|λ, QiI,

where the sums run over all partitions such that res(µ − λ, Q)I = i. This endows
F(Q)I with a structure of g′-module. The Fock space F(Q)I can also be equipped
with a symmetric non-degenerate bilinear form h•, •iI for which the standard mono-
mial basis is orthonormal. To avoid cumbersome notation, we shall omit the subscript
I when not necessary. It is easy to see that every element of the standard monomial
basis is a weight vector.

The g′-submodule of F(Q) generated by |∅, Qi is isomorphic to L(ΛQ). Further-
more, if I = A∞, then F(Q) = L(ΛQ). Using the minimal categoriﬁcation L (ΛQ) of
L(ΛQ), the map L(ΛQ) → F(Q) can be made more explicit.

To explain this, let us ﬁrst recall brieﬂy the deﬁnition of the Specht modules.
Assume that R has characteristic 0 and contains a primitive l-th root ζ of 1, so R is
a splitting ﬁeld of the complex reﬂection group G(l, 1, m). Let Irr(RSm) = {φλ | λ ∈
Pm} be the standard labelling of the characters of the symmetric group. Then

Irr(RG(l, 1, m)) = {Xλ | λ ∈ P l

m}

is the labelling of the simple modules such that Xλ is induced from the G(l, 1, |λ1|) ×
. . . × G(l, 1, |λl|)-module

φλ(1)χ0 ⊗ φλ(2)χ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ φλ(l)χl−1.

Here, we denote by χp the one-dimensional module of the |λp|-th cartesian power of
the cyclic group G(l, 1, 1) given by the p-th power of the determinant, see, e.g., [33,
sec. 5.1.3]. Recall that (for every ﬁeld R) the R-algebra HQ; v
R,m is split and that it is
semisimple if and only if we have, see, e.g., [58, sec. 3.2],

mYi=1

(1 + v + · · · + vi−1)Ya<b Y−m<r<m

(vr Qa − Qb) 6= 0.

18

O. DUDAS, M. VARAGNOLO, E. VASSEROT

Thus, by Tits’ deformation theorem, under the specialization v 7→ 1 and Qp 7→ ζ p−1,
the labelling of Irr(RG(l, 1, m)) yields a canonical labelling

Irr(HQ; v

m}.

R,m) = {S(λ)Q; v

R | λ ∈ P l

Now, if R is a commutative domain with fraction ﬁeld K of characteristic 0 as above,
we deﬁne the HQ; v
R as in [60, sec. 2.4.3] or [33, sec. 5.3], using S(λ)Q; v
and the dominance order on P l
m, and if θ : R → k is a ring homomorphism such
that k is the fraction ﬁeld of θ(R) we set S(λ)Q; v

R,m-module S(λ)Q, v

k = kS(λ)Q, v
R .

K

Proposition 2.1. Let R be a ﬁeld of characteristic 0 which contains a primitive l-th
root of 1. The composition [L (ΛQ)] ∼→ L(ΛQ) → F(Q) obtained from Theorem 1.4
sends the class of S(λ)Q, v
(cid:3)

to the standard monomial |λ, Qi.

R

For each p = 1, . . . , l, let Ip be the subquiver of I corresponding to the subset vZQp
of I. We deﬁne a relation on {1, . . . , l} by i ∼ j ⇐⇒ Ii = Ij. Let Ω = {1, . . . , l}/ ∼
be the set of equivalence classes for this relation. Given p ∈ Ω, we denote by Qp
the tuple of (Qi1, . . . , Qir ) where (i1, . . . , ir) is the ordered set of elements in p. The
I =
Ip. The corresponding decomposition of Fock spaces is given in the following

decomposition I = Fp∈Ω Ip yields a canonical decomposition of Lie algebras g′
Lp∈Ω g′

proposition.

Proposition 2.2. The map |λ, QiI 7−→ ⊗p∈Ω|λp, QpiIp yields an isomorphism of
g′
I-modules F(Q)I
(cid:3)

∼−→ Np∈Ω F(Qp)Ip.

2.3. Charged Fock spaces.

A charged Fock space is a pair F(s) = (F(Q), s) such that s ∈ Zl is a charge of
Q, that is Q = (vs1, . . . , vsl). Throughout this section, we will always assume that
I is either of type A∞ or a cyclic quiver. For more general quivers we can invoke
Proposition 2.2 to reduce to that case.

2.3.1. The g-action on the Fock space. The action of g′ on F(Q) can be extended to
an action of g when Q admits a charge s. We describe this action in the case where
v has ﬁnite order e, and l = 1. In that case I = vZ is isomorphic to the cyclic quiver
A(1)
e−1 and the charge s is just an integer d ∈ Z such that Q = vd. If we ﬁx the aﬃne

simple root to be α1, then X = P ⊕Zδ and X∨ = Q∨ ⊕Z∂ with δ = Pi∈I αi and

1 (see Example 1.1 for more details).

∂ = Λ∨

We deﬁne the integer

(2.3)

∆(d, e) =(cid:0) ¯d(1 − ¯d/e) + d(d/e − 1)(cid:1)/2,

where ¯d is the residue of d modulo e in [0, e − 1]. Then, the action of the derivation
∂ on F(d) = (F(Q), d) is

19

For this action the weight of a standard basis element is

∂(|λ, Qi) = −(cid:0)n1(λ, Q) + ∆(d, e)(cid:1)|λ, Qi.
wt(|λ, Qi) = ΛQ −Xi∈I

ni(λ, Q) αi − ∆(d, e) δ.

(2.4)

i = 2Λi − Λiv − Λiv−1 and Λcl

We now describe the action of the aﬃne Weyl group of g on F(d). For i ∈ I r {1},
we denote by αcl
i = Λi − Λ1 the i-th simple root and
fundamental weight of sle. These (classical) simple roots span the lattice of classical
roots Qcl. The aﬃne Weyl group of g is W = SI ⋉ Qcl. It acts linearly on X. We
will denote by tγ the action of an element γ ∈ Qcl, i.e., for each α ∈ X we set

(2.5)

tγ(α) = α + (α : δ) γ − (α : γ) δ −

1
2

(α : δ)(γ : γ) δ

where (• : •) is the standard symmetric non-degenerate bilinear form on X × X. Now,
Q ∈ Qcl and

we consider the element πs =Pi∈I(si − siv) Λi. If s ∈ ZI(d), then πs − Λcl

we can consider the corresponding operator tπs−Λcl

on X.

Q

Proposition 2.3. Let λ and ν be two partitions. Let s ∈ ZI(d) be such that (∅, s) =
τe(λ[e], d), where λ[e] is the e-core of λ.
(a) The weight of |λ, Qi equals wt(|λ, Qi) = tπs−Λcl
(b) The weights of |λ, Qi and |ν, Qi are W -conjugate if and only if we(λ) = we(ν).
(cid:3)

(ΛQ) − we(λ) δ.

Q

In the particular case where the charge is zero, then s = λ[e], and

(2.6)

wt(|λ, 1i) = tπλ[e]

(Λ1) − we(λ) δ.

Therefore weight spaces are parametrized by pairs (ν, w) where ν is an e-core and w is
a non-negative integer. The basis element |λ, 1i is in the weight space corresponding
to (λ[e], we(λ)).

2.3.2. The crystal of the Fock space. We explain here how to associate an abstract
crystal to a charged Fock space F(s). By Proposition 2.2, we can assume that I is
either cyclic or of type A∞. We assume that the reader is familiar with [65].

When I has type A∞, Uglov’s bases coincide with the standard monomial basis
and the discussion is trivial in that case. We will therefore assume that v has ﬁnite
order e and I = vZ, so that I has type A(1)

e−1.

The g-module F(Q) admits a quantum deformation Fu(s) with an A-lattice FA(s),
which is a free A-module with basis {|µ, si | µ ∈ P l}. It is equipped with an inte-
grable representation of UA(g). Note that the action of the Chevalley generators ei
and fi depends on the choice of the charge s. The representation of g on F(s) given
in §2.3.1 is recovered by specializing the parameter u to 1. Uglov has constructed
a remarkable A-basis B+
u (µ, s) | µ ∈ P l} of FA(s) which is a lower global
basis for the representation of Uu(g) on Fu(s).

u (s) = {b+

u (s) = {b∨

u (µ, s) | µ ∈ P l} be the C(u)-basis of Fu(s) dual to B+

Next, we consider the pairing (•, •) on Fu(s) deﬁned in [66, sec. 4.3]. Then,
let B∨
u (s) with
respect to the bilinear form (•, •). It is an upper global basis of Fu(s). Let B∨(s) =
{b∨(µ, s) | µ ∈ P l} be the specialization at u = 1 of B∨
u (s), with the obvious labeling
of its elements. It is a perfect basis of the usual Fock space F(s) = Fu(s)|u=1 by
Proposition 1.8.

We equip the set of l-partitions with the abstract crystal structure B(s) =(cid:0)P l,eei,efi(cid:1)

deﬁned in [44]. Let B(s) = {b(µ, s) | µ ∈ P l} be the obvious labeling. The map
b∨(µ, s) ∈ B∨(s) 7−→ b(µ, s) ∈ B(s) is a crystal isomorphism.

3. Unipotent representations

In this section we record standard results on unipotent representations of ﬁnite

reductive groups in non-deﬁning characteristic. A good reference is [7].

3.1. Basics.

By an ℓ-modular system we will mean a triple (K, O, k) where K is a ﬁeld of
characteristic zero, O is a complete discrete valuation ring with fraction ﬁeld K, and
k is the residue ﬁeld of O with char(k) = ℓ. When working with representations of a
ﬁnite group Γ, we will always assume that (K, O, k) is a splitting ℓ-modular system
for Γ, which means that K and k are splitting ﬁelds for all subgroups of Γ. When
Γ comes from an algebraic group in characteristic p, we will in addition assume that
ℓ 6= p. This case is usually referred to as the non-deﬁning characteristic case.

Let R be any commutative domain (with 1) and Γ be a ﬁnite group. We will
assume that p is invertible in R and O. Let RΓ denote the group ring of Γ over
R. For any subset S ⊆ Γ such that |S| is invertible in R, let eS be the element

eS = |S|−1Pg∈S g in RΓ. When S is a subgroup, eS is an idempotent. If R is not a

ﬁeld, an RΓ-module which is free as an R-module will be called an RΓ-lattice.

We shall identify isomorphism classes of irreducible representations over K with
their character. When R is a ﬁeld containing K, we denote by R Irr(KΓ) or R Irr(Γ)
the R-module of class functions Γ → R.
It is endowed with the canonical scalar

product h•, •iΓ, for which the set of irreducible characters Irr(KΓ) of KΓ is an
orthonormal basis.

21

3.2. Unipotent KG-modules.

By a rational group we will mean a pair (G, F ) consisting of an algebraic group
G over Fq and a Frobenius endomorphism F of G. Assume that G is a connected
reductive group. Fix a parabolic subgroup P of G and an F -stable Levi complement
L of P. We do not assume P to be F -stable. Write L = LF and G = GF .

Let RG

L⊂P and ∗RG

L⊂P and ∗RG

L⊂P denote respectively the Lusztig induction and restriction
maps from Z Irr(KL) to Z Irr(KG). We will assume that the Mackey formula holds
for RG
L⊂P, which we know for the groups we will focus on later (see [2]
for more details). Under this condition, the Lusztig induction and restriction do not
depend on the choice of the parabolic subgroup P. We abbreviate RG
L and
∗RG

L⊂P = ∗RG
L .
Let B be an F -stable Borel subgroup of G and T be an F -stable maximal torus
of G with T ⊂ B. Let N be the normalizer of T in G. Write B = BF , T = TF
and N = NF . The groups B, N form a reductive BN-pair of G with Weyl group
W = WG given by W = N/T. Since B, N are stable by F and G is connected, the
ﬁnite groups B, N form a split BN-pair of G whose Weyl group W = W (T ) is given
by W = WF = N/T .

L⊂P = RG

The G-conjugacy classes of F -stable maximal tori of G are parametrized by the F -
conjugacy classes in W. For each w ∈ W let Tw be an F -stable maximal torus in the
G-conjugacy class parametrized by the F -conjugacy class of w. Under conjugation
In
by some element of G, the pair (Tw, F ) is identiﬁed with the pair (T, wF ).
particular, we have Tw ≃ TwF and W (Tw) ≃ WwF . The virtual characters RG
Tw(1)
obtained by induction of the trivial representation of the tori Tw are called the virtual
Deligne-Lusztig characters.

Deﬁnition 3.1. An irreducible KG-module is unipotent if its character, say χ, occurs
as a constituent of a virtual Deligne-Lusztig character RG
Tw(1) for some element
w ∈ W , i.e., if we have hχ, RG

Tw(1)iG 6= 0.

We denote by KG -umod the full subcategory of KG -mod consisting of the mod-
ules which are sums of irreducible unipotent modules. The objects of this category
are the unipotent KG-modules.

Remark 3.2. Fix an element σ in the normalizer of L in G such that the conjugation
by σ yields an element in the normalizer of WL in W. Let us denote it again by
the symbol σ. Then, we can equip the subgroup L ⊆ G with the rational structure
with the Frobenius endomorphism σF and we have Lusztig induction and restriction

3.3. Unipotent kG-modules and ℓ-blocks.

As a result of the lifting of idempotents, the blocks of OG and kG correspond by
reduction. Both are usually called the ℓ-blocks of G. For R = O or k, any block
B of RG is of the form B = RG · b, where b is a central primitive idempotent of
RG. The unit b of B is called the block idempotent of B. We will also call block of
RG -mod associated with B the Serre subcategory generated by the simple modules
on which b acts non-trivially. The ℓ-blocks of G induce a partition of Irr(KG) such
that the piece associated with B is the set of all irreducible characters χ of KG with
χ(b) = χ(1). If χ ∈ Irr(KG), we will write B(χ) ⊆ Irr(KG) for the piece containing
χ. When there is no risk of confusion, we will also call B(χ) an ℓ-block of G.

Deﬁnition 3.3. An ℓ-block of OG is unipotent if it contains at least one unipotent
KG-module. A simple kG-module is unipotent if it lies in a unipotent block of kG.

We denote by kG -umod the Serre subcategory of kG -mod generated by the simple
unipotent kG-modules. It corresponds to the sum of unipotent blocks of kG -mod.
The unipotent kG-modules are by deﬁnition the objects of this category.

Recall that (K, O, k) is a splitting ℓ-modular system for G. To this system one can
associate a decomposition map dOG : [KG -mod] → [kG -mod]. By [40, thm. 3.1],
a simple kG-module is unipotent if and only if it is a constituent of the ℓ-reduction
of a unipotent KG-module, see also [5].
In other words, the classes of unipotent
modules are exactly the image of unipotent characters through the decomposition
map. We will denote by dU : [KG -umod] → [kG -umod] the restriction of this map
to unipotent characters.

Theorem 3.4 (Geck-Hiss [29], Geck [27]). Assume ℓ is good for G and that ℓ ∤
|Z(G)/Z(G)◦|. Then the map dU is a linear isomorphism [KG -umod] ∼→ [kG -umod].
(cid:3)

Note that if G is semisimple with no component of type A, then the condition
ℓ ∤ |Z(G)/Z(G)◦| is superﬂuous since every prime divisor of |Z(G)/Z(G)◦| is a bad
prime.

Given a positive integer f , let Φf be the f th cyclotomic polynomial. If T ⊂ G is
an F -stable torus, then the order of T := TF is a polynomial in q with coeﬃcients in
Z. We say that T (and by extension T ) is a Φf -torus if this polynomial is a power
of Φf . An F -stable Levi subgroup L ⊆ G is f -split if it is the centralizer in G of

23

a Φf -torus. A unipotent f -pair is a pair (L, χ) where L is an f -split Levi subgroup
and χ is an irreducible unipotent KL-module. The pair (L, χ) is f -cuspidal if for
every proper f -split Levi subgroup M ⊆ L we have ∗RL

M(χ) = 0.

Now assume that f is the smallest positive integer such that ℓ divides qf − 1.
Under the assumption that ℓ is good, unipotent ℓ-blocks correspond to f -cuspidal
f -pairs.

Theorem 3.5 (Brou´e-Malle-Michel [4], Cabanes-Enguehard [7]). Assume ℓ is good
for G, and ℓ 6= 3 if G has a component of type 3D4. Then there is a bijection between
the G-conjugacy classes of unipotent f -cuspidal f -pairs and the set of unipotent ℓ-
blocks of G which takes the class of (L, χ) to the ℓ-block BL,χ such that the irreducible
unipotent characters in BL,χ are exactly the irreducible constituents of RG
(cid:3)

L (χ).

3.4. Harish-Chandra series.

Assume now that the parabolic subgroup P ⊆ G considered in §3.2 is F -stable. In
that case the group L is G-conjugate to a standard Levi subgroup of G. Let RG
L and
∗RG
L be the corresponding Harish-Chandra induction and restriction functors between
RL -mod and RG -mod. Let P = PF and U = UF , where U ⊂ P is the unipotent
radical of P. Notice that the Harish-Chandra induction is the special case of Lusztig
induction for 1-split Levi subgroups.

The order of U is a power of q, hence it is invertible in R. Thus, for all M ∈

RL -mod, N ∈ RG -mod we have

RG

L (M) = RG · eU ⊗RL M and ∗RG

L (N) = eU · RG ⊗RG N.

We will say that the functors RG
RG · eU and the (RL, RG)-bimodule eU · RG respectively.

L and ∗RG

L are represented by the (RG, RL)-bimodule

Here are some well-known basic properties of the functors RG

Let R = K or k. An irreducible RG-module E is cuspidal if ∗RG

L (E) = 0 for
all proper standard Levi subgroups L ( G. A cuspidal pair of RG is a pair (L, E)
where L is as above and E ∈ Irr(RL) is cuspidal. Since the group L is uniquely
recovered from E, from now on we may omit it from the notation. Then, the set
Irr(RG, E) ⊆ Irr(RG) consisting of the constituents of the head of RG
L (E) is equal
to the set of constituents of the socle of RG
L (E) and is called the Harish-Chandra

series of (L, E). The R-algebra H (RG, E) = EndRG(RG

(d) the Harish-Chandra series form a partition of Irr(RG),
L (E) as deﬁned in §1.1 yields a bijection
(e) the functor FRG

L (E))op is its ramiﬁed Hecke

Proposition 3.6 ([3]). If R = K or k, then the Harish-Chandra induction and
restriction functors preserve the category of unipotent RG-modules.
(cid:3)

4. Finite unitary groups

This section is devoted to the construction of categorical actions on the category

of unipotent representations of ﬁnite unitary groups GUn(q).

Let R be a commutative domain with unit. Under mild assumptions on R, we

construct in §4.2 a representation datum on the abelian category

RG -mod :=Mn>0

GUn(q) -mod

given by Harish-Chandra induction and restriction. When R is an extension of Qℓ or
Fℓ, the categorical datum restricts to the category UR of unipotent representations
of RG -mod. On this smaller category, the eigenvalues of X are powers of −q, which
hints that the Lie algebra g that should act on [UR] corresponds to the quiver with
vertices (−q)Z and arrows given by multiplication by q2.

We prove that the representation datum lifts indeed to a categorical action of g
on UR. The situation depends on the parity of e, the order of −q modulo ℓ. When

now transverse to the ordinary Harish-Chandra series.

Harish-Chandra series categoriﬁes a level 2 Fock space for g. When e is odd (unitary

e is even, i.e., ℓ is a linear prime, g is a subalgebra of (dsle/2)⊕2 and each ordinary
prime case), g ≃csle and weight spaces correspond to unipotent ℓ-blocks, which are

For studying the weight space decomposition of [UR] as well as the action of the
aﬃne Weyl group we use the action of a bigger Lie algebra g◦, which comes from
Harish-Chandra induction and restriction for general linear groups. Going from linear
to unitary groups by Ennola duality introduces signs for this action (see Lemma 4.15).
It is to be expected that the action of g◦ on [UR] lifts to an action by triangulated
functors on Db(UR) coming from Lusztig induction, although we will not use it. See
[19] for more details.

25

4.1. Deﬁnition.

Fix a positive integer n. We equip the reductive algebraic group GLn = GLn(Fq)
with the standard Frobenius map Fq : GLn → GLn, (aij) 7→ (aq
ij) given by raising
every coeﬃcient to the qth power. The ﬁnite general linear group GLn(q) is given by
the ﬁxed points of GLn under Fq. In this section we will work with a twisted version
of this group obtained by twisting the Frobenius map. Let Jn be the n × n matrix
with entry 1 in (i, n − i + 1) and zero elsewhere. We will often write J = Jn when
there is no risk of confusion on the size of the matrices. We deﬁne a new Frobenius
map F on GLn, called the twisted Frobenius map, by setting F = Fq ◦ α where
α(g) = J · tg−1 · J for each g ∈ GLn. The ﬁnite unitary group Gn = GUn(q) is then
given by

Gn = (GLn)F = {g ∈ GLn ; F (g) = g}.

Since F 2 = Fq2 we have Gn ⊂ GLn, where we abbreviate
GLn = GLn(q2) := (GLn)F 2

.

By convention we also deﬁne G0 = {1} to be the trivial group.

We equip GLn with the standard split BN-pair such that B is the subgroup of
upper triangular matrices and N is the subgroup of all monomial matrices. Since B,
N are stable by F and GLn is connected, the groups B = BF , N = NF form a split
BN-pair of the ﬁnite group Gn. Let T be the diagonal torus in GLn and T = TF .
Let W = Wn be the Weyl group of GLn and W = Wn be the Weyl group of Gn.
We have W ≃ Sn, and F induces on W the automorphism given by conjugation
with the longest element w0. We will embed W in Gn using permutation matrices,
so that w0 corresponds to J. We have W = WF = CW(w0). It is a Weyl group of
type Bm if n = 2m or 2m + 1.

Let ε1, . . . , εn be the characters of T such that t = diag(ε1(t), ε2(t), . . . , εn(t)) for
all t ∈ T. The roots (resp. simple roots) of GLn are given by {εi − εj | i 6= j} (resp.
{εr − εr+1}). Let sr = (r, r + 1) be the simple reﬂection in W associated with the
simple root αr = εr − εr+1. The action of F on the roots induces an automorphism
σ of the Dynkin diagram of GLn such that

F ◦ α∨

r = qσ(αr)∨ with σ(αr) = αn−r.

For each root α, let Uα and α∨ ∈ Hom(Gm, T) be the corresponding root sub-
∼→ Uα such that
group and cocharacter. We also choose an isomorphism uα : Ga
F (uσ(α)(t)) = uα(tq). Note that a one-parameter subgroup of T has either (q2 − 1)
or (q + 1) elements, and a root subgroup of Gn has either q or q2 elements.

The standard Levi subgroups Lr,λ of Gn are parametrized by pairs (r, λ) where r
is a non-negative integer and λ = (λ1, λ2, . . . , λs) is a tuple of positive integers such

26

to Gn and are of block-diagonal type

u=1 λu. The group Lr,λ consists of all matrices of GLn which belong

sYu=1

GLλu × GLr ×

GLλu.

1Yu=s

Consequently we have a group isomorphism Lr,λ ≃ Gr ×Qu GLλu. If m is a positive

integer we abbreviate Lr,1m = Lr,(1m) and Lr,m = Lr,(m).

4.2. The representation datum on RG-mod.

Let R be a commutative domain with unit. We assume that q(q2 − 1) in invertible
in R. Using parabolic induction and restriction, we show in this section how to
construct a representation datum on

RG -mod :=Mn∈N

RGn -mod .

Fix a positive integer n. Parabolic (or Harish-Chandra) induction provides functors
between L -mod and Gn -mod for any standard Levi subgroup L = Lr,m ⊂ Gn. Since
we want functors between Gr -mod and Gn -mod we will consider a slight variation
of the usual parabolic induction.

Let 0 6 r < n. We denote by Vr the unipotent radical of the standard parabolic
subgroup Pr,1 ⊂ Gr+2 with Levi complement Lr,1. Let Ur ⊂ Gr+2 be the subgroup
given by

(4.1)

Ur = Vr ⋊ F×

q2 =





so that Pr,1 = Vr ⋊ Lr,1 ≃ Ur ⋊ Gr. If n − r is even, we set Un,r = Un−2 ⋊ · · · ⋊ Ur and
we deﬁne en,r = eUn,r to be the corresponding idempotent. In particular, we have
er+2,r = eUr . We embed Gr into the Levi subgroup Lr,1m = Gr × GLm
1 in the obvious
way. This yields an embedding Gr ⊂ Gn and functors

Fn,r = RGn · en,r ⊗RGr • : RGr -mod −→ RGn -mod,
Er,n = en,r · RGn ⊗RGn • : RGn -mod −→ RGr -mod .

Note that Fn,r can be seen as the composition of the inﬂation Gr -mod −→ Lr,1m -mod
with the parabolic induction from Lr,1m to Gn.

An endomorphism of the functor Fn,r can be represented by an (RGn, RGr)-
bimodule endomorphism of RGn · en,r, or equivalently by an element of en,r · RGn · en,r
centralizing RGr. Thus, the elements
Xr+2,r = (−q)rer+2,r(1, r + 2) er+2,r,

Tr+4,r = q2er+4,r(1, 2)(r + 3, r + 4) er+4,r

deﬁne respectively natural transformations of the functors Fr+2,r and Fr+4,r. We set

(cid:3)

Remark 4.2. The reader might argue that we did not check that X was invertible.
Nevertheless, we shall only be working with unipotent modules over a ﬁeld, in which
case the eigenvalues of X are powers of −q, hence non-zero (see Theorem 4.8). This
will ensure that the restriction of X to this category is indeed invertible.

4.3. The categories of unipotent modules UK and Uk.

From now on, we ﬁx a prime number ℓ such that ℓ ∤ q (q2 − 1), and an ℓ-modular
system (K, O, k) with Qℓ ⊂ K and Fℓ ⊂ k. Although this modular system is not
large enough for all the ﬁnite groups encountered, it will be enough for our purpose
since we will be working with unipotent characters only, which are deﬁned over Qℓ
(see below).

Throughout the following sections, we will denote by d, e and f the order of q2,
−q and q in k×. In particular e 6= 1, 2. If e is odd, then d = e and f = 2e; if e is
even, then d = e/2 and either f = e/2 if e ≡ 2 mod 4 or f = e if e ≡ 0 mod 4.

4.3.1. The category UK. Fix a positive integer n. By [56], the irreducible unipotent
KGn-modules are labelled by partitions of n. Their character can be directly con-
structed from the virtual Deligne-Lusztig characters. Namely, for each w ∈ Sn, ﬁx
an F -stable maximal torus Tw ⊆ GLn in the Gn-conjugacy class parametrized by
the Sn-conjugacy class of wF in the coset SnF , with the convention that T1 = T.
Then the class function

(4.2)

φλ(ww0)RGLn

Tw (1) ∈ ZIrr(KGn)

χλ = |Sn|−1 Xw∈Sn

is, up to a sign, an irreducible unipotent character. Since the cohomology groups are
deﬁned over Qℓ ⊂ K and since any character of Sn has rational values, either χλ or
−χλ is the character of some irreducible KGn-module which we denote by Eλ. By

28

O. DUDAS, M. VARAGNOLO, E. VASSEROT

abuse of notation we will still denote by Eλ its isomorphism class. Let ελ be the sign
determined by the relation χλ = ελ Eλ.

Recall that G0 = {1}. We call the category of unipotent KG-modules the category

UK :=Mn∈N

KGn -umod .

This category is abelian semisimple. From the previous discussion we have

where by convention Irr(KG0) = {E∅}.

Irr(UK) = {Eλ | λ ∈ P},

4.3.2. The category Uk. Using the ℓ-modular system we have decomposition maps
dOGn which by Proposition 3.4 restrict to linear isomorphisms

dOGn : [KGn -umod] ∼→ [kGn -umod].

Note that we do not need to assume that KGn is a split algebra since we are only
interested in unipotent KGn-modules, which are all absolutely irreducible.

For unitary groups, this map is actually unitriangular with respect to the basis of

irreducible modules and the dominance order.

Theorem 4.3 ([26]). There is a unique labelling {Dλ}λ∈Pn of the unipotent simple

kGn-modules such that dOGn([Eλ]) ∈ [Dλ] +Pν>λ Z[Dν] where > is the dominance

order on partitions of n.

(cid:3)

We call the category of unipotent kG-modules the category

Uk :=Mn∈N

kGn -umod .

This is an abelian category which is not semisimple. The isomorphism classes of
simple objects are Irr(Uk) = {Dλ}λ∈P and the decomposition map yields a Z-linear
isomorphism dU : [UK] ∼→ [Uk]. The following result is a consequence of the unitri-
angularity of this map.

that

Proposition 4.4. Given a partition λ ⊢ n there is a unique OGn-lattice eEλ such
(a) KeEλ = Eλ as a KGn-module,
(b) Vλ := keEλ is an indecomposable kGn-module with head isomorphic to Dλ,

(c) dU ([Eλ]) = [Vλ].

(cid:3)

29

4.3.3. Blocks of Uk. A block of Uk is an indecomposable summand of Uk. Therefore
blocks of Uk correspond to the unipotent blocks of kGn where n runs over N. Recall
that e is the order of −q modulo ℓ.

Proposition 4.5 ([22]). The map Eλ 7−→ (λ[e], we(λ)) yields a bijection between
unipotent ℓ-blocks and pairs (s, w) where s ∈ Ze(0) and w ∈ N.
(cid:3)

Recall that ν 7→ ν[e] induces a bijection between e-cores and Ze(0). Given ν
an e-core we will denote by Bν,w or Bν[e],w the unipotent ℓ-block containing all the
unipotent characters Eλ such that ν is the e-core of λ and we(λ) = w. It is a block
of kGn with n = |ν| + ew.

It also follows from the classiﬁcation of blocks that when w < e and e 6= 1,
the defect group of Bν,w is an elementary abelian ℓ-group of rank w (see [4]).
In
particular, when w = 0 the module Dλ is simple and projective, isomorphic to Vλ,
and when w = 1 the defect group of Bν,w is a cyclic group. The structure of such
blocks was determined in [24].

4.3.4. The weak Harish-Chandra series. For this section we assume that R is one of
the ﬁelds K or k.

Let r, m > 0 and n = r + 2m. The inﬂation from Gr to Lr,1m yields an equiv-
alence between RGr -umod and RLr,1m -umod, since the Deligne-Lusztig varieties
depend only on the semisimple type of the reductive group. This equivalence inter-
twines the functors En,r, Fn,r with the parabolic restriction and induction ∗RGn
Lr,1m ,
RGn
Lr,1m . Therefore working with UR and the functors E and F is the same as work-
ing in the usual framework of unipotent representations and Harish-Chandra induc-
tion/restriction from Levi subgroups. Note however that we do not consider all the
standard Levi subgroups, but only the ones that are conjugate to Lr,1m. Therefore we
need to consider a slight variation of the usual Harish-Chandra theory. The following
deﬁnitions and properties are taken from [36].

Deﬁnition 4.6. Fix a non-negative integer n.
(a) An RGn-module D is weakly cuspidal if ∗RGn

L (D) = 0 for any Levi subgroup

L ( Gn which is Gn-conjugate to a subgroup of the form Lr,1m.

(b) A weakly cuspidal pair of RGn is a pair which is Gn-conjugate to (Lr,1m , D) for
some n = r + 2m and some weakly cuspidal irreducible RGr-module D which is
viewed as a kLr,1m-module by inﬂation.

(c) The weak Harish-Chandra series WIrr(RGn, D) of RGn determined by the weakly
L (D). By

cuspidal pair (L, D) is the set of the constituents of the head of RGn
[36], it coincides with the set of the constituents of its socle.

If D is a unipotent RGr-module, then D is weakly cuspidal if and only if E(D) = 0.
Moreover, if D is irreducible, the weak Harish-Chandra series coincides with the set
of irreducible constituents in the head of F mD. Therefore it makes sense to deﬁne
the weak Harish-Chandra series of D in UR by

WIrr(RG, D) =Gn>r

WIrr(RGn, D).

It is the set of irreducible consituents in the head of F kD for some k > 0 (or equiv-
alently in the socle). As in the case of the usual theory, the weak Harish-Chandra

series of UR form a partition of Irr(UR), i.e., we have Irr(UR) = F WIrr(RG, D)

where the sum runs over the set of isomorphism classes of weakly cuspidal unipotent
irreducible modules D.

When R = K, weakly cuspidal unipotent modules coincide with cuspidal modules
and were determined in [53]. One of the main results in this paper is the classiﬁcation
of the weakly cuspidal modules in the case where R = k.

4.4. The g∞-representation on UK.

In this section we show how the categorical datum deﬁned in §4.2 yields a categor-
ical representation on UR in the case where R = K. This is achieved by translating
into our framework the theory of Lusztig and Howlett-Lehrer on endomorphism al-
gebras of representations induced from a cuspidal module in [53] and [42].

4.4.1. Action of E and F . Since every unipotent character is a linear combination
of (virtual) Deligne-Lusztig characters − we call such a class function a uniform
function − it is well-known how to compute the action of E and F on the category
UK.

Lemma 4.7. Let λ be a partition. Then [E]([Eλ]) = Pµ[Eµ] and [F ]([Eλ]) =
Pµ′[Eµ′] where µ (resp. µ′) runs over the partitions that are obtained from λ by

removing (resp. adding) a 2-hook.

(cid:3)

We deduce that a unipotent KGn module Eλ is weakly cuspidal if and only if
there exists t > 0 such that n = t(t + 1)/2 and λ = ∆t = (t, t − 1, . . . , 1). We will
set Et := E∆t. Consequently, the weakly cuspidal pairs are, up to conjugation, the
pairs (Lr,1m, Et) with r = t(t + 1)/2. The partition into series is thus Irr(UK) =

Ft∈N WIrr(KG, Et).

4.4.2. The ramiﬁed Hecke algebra. Let r, m be non-negative integers and n = r +2m.
As mentioned in §4.3.4, the inﬂation from Gr to Lr,1m yields an equivalence between
KGr -umod and KLr,1m -umod which intertwines the functor Fn,r with the parabolic
induction RGn

Lr,1m . In particular, we have a canonical isomorphism
H (KGn, Et) := EndKGn(F m(Et))op ∼→ EndKGn(RGn

Lr,1m (Et))op.

Now recall from §1.3.1 that to the categorical datum (E, F, X, T ) is attached a map
φF m : Hq2
K,m → End(F m). The evaluation of this map at the module Et yields a
K-algebra homomorphism

φK,m : Hq2

K,m → H (KGn, Et), Xk 7→ Xk(Et), Tl 7→ Tl(Et).

By [42], H (KGn, Et) is isomorphic to a Hecke algebra HQt; q2

K,m of type Bm with

The previous map provides indeed such an isomorphism.

Theorem 4.8. Let t, m > 0 and n = t(t + 1)/2 + 2m. Then the map φK,m factors
through a K-algebra isomorphism HQt; q2

4.4.3. Parametrization of the weak Harish-Chandra series of UK. Let W (Bm) be the
Weyl group of type Bm, and t0, t1, . . . , tm−1 be the generators corresponding to the
following Dynkin diagram

t0

t1

tm−2 tm−1

Let us ﬁrst recall the construction of the irreducible characters of W (Bm). We denote
by σm the linear character of W (Bm) such that σm(t0) = −1 and σm(ti) = 1 for all

i > 0. Given λ ⊢ m a partition of m, we write eφλ for the inﬂation to W (Bm) of the

irreducible character of Sm corresponding to λ. Given a, b such that a + b = m, one
can consider the subgroups W (Ba)×Sb ⊂ W (Ba)×W (Bb) of W (Bm) where W (Ba)×
Sb is a parabolic subgroup generated by {t0, t1, . . . , ta−1} ∪ {ta+1, . . . , tm−1}, and
W (Ba) × W (Bb) is obtained by adding the reﬂection ta · · · t0 · · · ta. The irreducible
character of W (Bm) associated to a bipartition (λ, µ) of m is

By Tits deformation theorem, the specialization q 7→ 1 yields a bijection

Xλ,µ = IndW (Bm)

W (B|λ|)×W (B|µ|) (eφλ ⊠ σ|µ|eφµ).

from which we obtain a canonical labelling of the irreducible representations of

K,m ) = {S(λ, µ)Qt; q2

K

(T0 + 1)(T0 − q2t+1) = 0.

Using this generator instead of X, we obtain the usual presentation for a Hecke
algebra of type Bm with parameters (q2t+1, q2). The endomorphism of KW (Bm)
which is obtained from the renormalization HQt; q2
at q = 1 is the
identity on Sm but sends t0 to (−1)tt0. Therefore this renormalization sends S(λ, µ)
to S(λ, µ) if t is even, and to S(µ, λ) if t is odd.

4.4.4. The g∞-representation on UK. The functors E, F preserve the subcategory
UK by Proposition 3.6, hence (E, F, X, T ) yields a representation datum on UK. In
order to extend it to a categorical representation on UK, one should consider the
quiver I(q2) with vertices given by the various eigenvalues of X and arrows i −→ q2i.
In this section we will view the integer q as an element of K × in the obvious way.
Deﬁnition 4.10. Let I∞ denote the subset (−q)Z of K ×. We deﬁne g∞ to be the
(derived) Kac-Moody algebra associated to the quiver I∞(q2).

To avoid cumbersome notation, we will write for short I∞ = I∞(q2), and (−)∞ =
i } the fundamental weights, simple roots

(−)I∞. We denote by {Λi}, {αi} and {α∨

and simple coroots of g∞. Here X∞ coincides with P∞ = L ZΛi. Consequently,

there is a Lie algebra isomorphism (slZ)⊕2 ∼→ g∞ such that (α∨

For any t, m, n ∈ N, let (KGn, Et) -mod be the Serre subcategory of UK generated

by the modules F m(Et) with n = r + 2m and r = t(t + 1)/2. We deﬁne

UK,t =Mn>0

(KGn, Et) -mod .

Then UK =Lt>0

UK,t. We obtain our ﬁrst categoriﬁcation result.

Theorem 4.11. Let t > 0 and Qt be as in (4.3).
(a) The Harish-Chandra induction and restriction functors yield a representation of

g∞ on UK,t which is isomorphic to L (ΛQt)∞.

4.5. The ge-representation on Uk.

By Proposition 3.6, the representation datum (E, F, X, T ) on kG -mod induces a
representation datum on Uk. Since the abelian category Uk is not semisimple, to
extend the representation datum to a categorical g-representation one needs to prove
that weight spaces of Uk are sums of blocks. This will be done combinatorially by
studying a representation of a bigger Lie algebra ge,◦.

4.5.1. The Lie algebras ge and ge,◦. The eigenvalues of X on E and F are all powers
of −q. If we denote again by q the image of q under the canonical map O ։ k, then
the eigenvalues of X on kE and kF belong to the ﬁnite set (−q)Z ⊂ k×. This set has
exactly e elements, where e is the order of −q in k×.
Deﬁnition 4.12. We deﬁne Ie to be the subset (−q)Z of k×. We denote by Ie and
Ie,◦ the ﬁnite quivers Ie(q2) and Ie(−q).

The quivers Ie and Ie,◦ have the same set of vertices, but the arrows in Ie are
the composition of two consecutive arrows in Ie,◦. The quiver Ie,◦ is cyclic, whereas
the quiver Ie is cyclic if e is odd, and is a union of two cyclic quivers if e is even.

Therefore the corresponding Kac-Moody algebras are isomorphic to bsle or (bsle/2)⊕2.

To avoid cumbersome notation, we will write (•)e,◦ = (•)Ie,◦ and (•)e = (•)Ie. We
e = [ge, ge].
e are ei,◦, fi,◦ and ei, fi respectively, for i ∈

If e is even, then Ie is the disjoint union of two cyclic quivers and ˜ge is isomorphic

If e is odd, then Ie is a cyclic quiver and ge =ege is isomorphic to bsle. Let α1 be
e ⊕Ze∂ with ˜δ = P αi and
the aﬃne root, then we have eXe = Pe ⊕Z˜δ and eX

We deduce that the classes of the simple modules [Dλ] are also weight vectors.
Given ω ∈ Xe, we deﬁne Uk,ω to be the Serre subcategory of Uk generated by

36

O. DUDAS, M. VARAGNOLO, E. VASSEROT

4.6.1. Characterization of the blocks of Uk. Here we investigate which block can
occur in a given weight space.

Assume e is even. Given t ∈ N and ω ∈ Xe, we deﬁne Uk,t (resp. Uk,t,ω) to be
the Serre subcategory of Uk generated by simple modules Dλ where λ has 2-core ∆t
(resp. with in addition ωλ = ω). With e being even, any pair of partitions with the
same e-core have the same 2-core, therefore Uk,t is a direct summand of Uk.

Proposition 4.18. Let ω ∈ Xe.
(a) If e is odd, then the category Uk,ω is an indecomposable summand of Uk.
(b) If e is even, then the category Uk,t,ω is an indecomposable summand of Uk,t and
(cid:3)

Uk for all t ∈ N.

4.6.2. Derived equivalences of blocks of Uk. It is not diﬃcult to compute the orbits of
the aﬃne Weyl group on the weight spaces of [Uk]. Hence, we can apply Proposition
4.18 and the work of Chuang and Rouquier [10] to produce derived equivalences
between blocks of Uk in the same orbit. Using the results of Livesey [51] on the
structure of good blocks for linear primes, we deduce that Brou´e’s abelian defect
group conjecture holds for unipotent blocks when e is even.

Theorem 4.19. Assume e is even. Let B be a unipotent block of Gn over k or O,
and D be a defect group of B. If the group D is abelian, then the block B is derived
equivalent to its Brauer correspondent in NGn(D).
(cid:3)

4.7. The crystals of UK and Uk.

Now, we want to compare the crystals of the categorical representations UK and Uk
(which are related to Harish-Chandra induction and restriction) with the crystals of
the Fock spaces related to [UK] and [Uk]. This solves the main conjecture of Gerber-
Hiss-Jacon [36] and gives a combinatorial way to compute the (weak) Harish-Chandra
branching graph and the Hecke algebras associated to the weakly cuspidal unipotent
modules.

4.7.1. Crystals and Harish-Chandra series. Recall that to any categorical representa-
tion one can associate a perfect basis, and hence an abstract crystal. In the previous
sections we constructed a categorical action on the categories of unipotent repre-
sentations over K (denoted by UK) and over k (denoted by Uk). From these two
categorical representations we get the following abstract crystals

(a) B(UK) =(cid:0)Irr(UK),eEi,eFi(cid:1) where Irr(UK) = {[Eλ] | λ ∈ P},
(b) B(Uk) =(cid:0)Irr(Uk),eEi,eFi(cid:1) where Irr(Uk) = {[Dλ] | λ ∈ P}.

The (uncolored) crystal graph associated with B(UR) coincides with the weak Harish-
Chandra branching graph, and its connected components with the weak Harish-
Chandra series.

Proposition 4.20. Let R = K or k, and I = (−q)Z ⊂ R×. Let D, M, N ∈ Irr(UR).

37

(a) D is weakly cuspidal if and only if eEi(D) = 0 for all i ∈ I.
(b) N appears in hd(F (M)) if and only if there exists i ∈ I such that N ≃ eFiM.

(c) If D is weakly cuspidal, then

WIrr(RG, D) = {eFi1 · · ·eFim(D) | m ∈ N, i1, . . . , im ∈ I}.

(cid:3)

Note that by [53], the ordinary Harish-Chandra series and weak Harish-Chandra

series on unipotent modules coincide when R = K.

4.7.2. Comparison of the crystals. In this section we will assume that e is odd. To
any charged Fock space one can associate an abstract crystal, see §2.3.2. We now
show how to choose the charge for each Fock space F(Qt)e so that the crystal will
coincide with the Harish-Chandra branching graph.

Deﬁne st = (s1, s2) = − 1

2 (e + 1, 0) + σt where σt is as in (2.1). We have Qp = q2sp
for each p = 1, 2. We denote by B(st)e the corresponding abstract crystal of F(Qt)e,
with the canonical labeling B(st)e = {b(µ, st) | µ ∈ P 2, t ∈ N}. Finally, we set

Be =F t∈N B(st)e.

Theorem 4.21. The map b(µ, st) 7→ [D̟t(µ)] is a crystal isomorphism Be

∼→ B(Uk).
(cid:3)

We deduce the following corollaries.

Corollary 4.22. The modules Dλ and Dν lie in the same weak Harish-Chandra
series if and only if the corresponding vertices of the abstract crystal Be belong to the
same connected component. In particular, if this holds then λ and ν have the same
2-core.
(cid:3)

Corollary 4.23. Let λ be a partition of r > 0 such that Dλ is weakly cuspidal.
(a) The e-core of λ is a 2-core ∆t = (t, t − 1, . . . , 1),

5. The representation of the Heisenberg algebra on Uk

Every cuspidal kGn-module is weakly cuspidal. Therefore, every Harish-Chandra
series in Irr(Uk) is partitioned into weak Harish-Chandra series. Proposition 4.20
and Theorem 4.21 yield a complete (combinatorial) description of the partition of
Irr(Uk) into weak Harish-Chandra series using the decomposition of [Uk] for the
action of ge. In this section we generalize this result to usual Harish-Chandra series
by adding the action of some Heisenberg algebra on [Uk]. Throughout this section
we will assume that e, the order of −q modulo ℓ is odd, and hence equal to d, the
order of q2 modulo ℓ.

5.1. The Heisenberg action on [Uk].

5.1.1. The Heisenberg algebra. Set ΛΛΛ = Lm∈N CIrr(KSm) where S0 is the trivial
group. We equip the vector space ΛΛΛ with the bilinear form h•, •iΛΛΛ =Lm∈Nh•, •iSm

and the vector space ΛΛΛ ⊗ ΛΛΛ with the tensor square of h•, •iΛΛΛ. The induction and
restriction yield a pair of linear maps Indn+m
n,m between the C-vector
spaces ΛΛΛ and ΛΛΛ ⊗ ΛΛΛ which are adjoint with respect to these bilinear forms.

n,m and Resn+m

Fix a positive integer a. A level a representation of the Heisenberg algebra, or an
n labelled
m] =

Ha-module, is a C-vector space V with a family of endomorphisms bn, b∗
by integers n ∈ aZ>0 satisfying the relations [bn, bm] = [b∗

m] = 0 and [bn, b∗

n, b∗

b∗

aλi.

−nδn,m. For each partition λ we write aλ = (aλ1, aλ2, . . . ) and baλ = Qi baλi,
aλ =Qi b∗

If λ is a partition of m and w ∈ Sm is of cycle-type ρ(w) = λ, we denote by cλ = cw
the conjugacy class of w. The characteristic function of cλ is a class function on Sm,
and as such it can be viewed as an element in ΛΛΛ. We abbreviate cm = c(m) for the
conjugacy class of the m-cycles. Let zλ be the number of elements of the centralizer
of w in Sm. We have hcλ, cµi = z−1

λ δλ,µ.

There is a unique representation of H1 on ΛΛΛ such that for every φ ∈ CIrr(Sr) and

ψ ∈ CIrr(Sn) with n = r + m we have

(5.1)

bλ(φ) = Indn

λ(ψ) = hResn

r,m(ψ) , zλcλiΛΛΛ.

5.1.2. The Heisenberg action on F(Q). Recall that e is the order of −q modulo ℓ.
We deﬁned in §4.5.1 a Kac-Moody algebra ge corresponding to a quiver Ie. From
now one we will assume that e is odd and we will abbreviate g = ge. Then g is

isomorphic to bsle. We can now deﬁne the representation of Hle on F(Q), where

Q = (Q1, . . . , Ql) ∈ I l
e. The Fock space F(Q) admits a representation of Hl which is
identiﬁed with the l-th tensor power of the representation of H1 on ΛΛΛ in (5.1) under
the C-linear isomorphism F(Q) ∼→ ΛΛΛ⊗l such that |µ, Qi 7→ φµ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ φµl. Then, by

(2.2), the representation of g′ on F(Q) commutes with the action of the subalgebra
Hle of Hl. We will apply this construction to l = 1 or 2.

39

5.1.3. The Heisenberg action on [Uk]. The previous section yields a representation
of H2e in F(Qt)e for each t ∈ N and a representation of He in F(1)e,◦. We want to
compare them.

Lemma 4.15, which is given by |µ, Qtie 7→ (−1)a(λ)|λ, 1ie,◦ with λ = ̟t(µ).

To do that, consider the C-linear isomorphismLt∈N F(Qt)e

∀µ ∈ P 2

intertwines the operator bn ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ bn on ΛΛΛ ⊗ ΛΛΛ with the operator b2n on ΛΛΛ if
n ∈ eZ>0. Here, we have set λ = ̟t(µ).

To do this, note that we have

(5.2)

b2n(φλ) =Xν

(−1)N (λ,x,2n) φν,

where the sum runs over all partitions ν obtained by adding a 2n-hook (x, x + 2n)
to the charged partition (λ, 0) and N(λ, x, 2n) is the number of elements in β0(λ) ∩
(x, x + 2n). Recall that σt = (σ1, σ2). Since

β0(λ) = (−1 + 2βσ1(µ1)) ⊔ (2βσ2(µ2)),

we have

N(λ, x, 2n) =(N(µ1, y − σ1, n) + |(2βσ2(µ2)) ∩ (x, x + 2n)|

|(−1 + 2βσ1(µ1)) ∩ (x, x + 2n)| + N(µ2, y − σ2, n)

if x = −1 + 2y,
if x = 2y.

Furthermore, adding a 2n-hook (x, x + 2n) to λ is equivalent to adding an n-hook to
µ1 if x is odd or to µ2 if x is even. So we are reduced to check that if λ, ν, x are as
in the sum (5.2), then a(ν) − a(λ) has the same parity as the integer b(λ, x) given by

• |(2βσ2(µ2)) ∩ (x, x + 2n)| if x is odd,
• |(−1 + 2βσ1(µ1)) ∩ (x, x + 2n)| if x is even.

Now a partition ν obtained by adding a 2n-hook to λ can also be obtained by
adding n successive 2-hooks to λ. Therefore it is enough to check that the parity of

a(ν) − a(λ) and b(λ, x) are the same when n = 1. Since a(λ) = Pi(i − 1)λi, the

integer a(ν) − a(λ) is even if ν \ λ is a vertical 2-hook (increasing λi by 2 for some

40

i) or odd if ν \ λ is a horizontal 2-hook (increasing λi and λi+1 = λi by 1 for some
i). On the other hand, we have b(λ, x) = 0 (resp. b(λ, x) = 1) for a vertical 2-hook
(resp. for a horizontal 2-hook).
(cid:3)

We equip [Uk] with the unique representation of H2e such that the isomorphism
∼→ [Uk] in Theorem 4.17 is H2e-equivariant. From Lemmas 4.15 and 5.1

we deduce that there is a ge × H2e-equivariant isomorphism given by

Lt∈N F(Qt)e

(5.3)

[Uk] ∼→ F(1)e,◦,

[Vλ] 7→ (−1)a(λ)|λ, 1ie,◦.

Remark 5.2. Set A(λ) = m(m − 1)/2 − a(λ∗) with m = |λ|. By [17, lem. 4.2] we
have (−1)A(λ) = ελ where ελ was deﬁned in §4.3.1. From this we can check that

λ[2] = ν[2] ⇒ (−1)a(λ)ελ = (−1)a(ν)εν.

Hence, the endomorphism of [Uk] such that [Vλ] 7→ (−1)a(λ)ελ [Vλ] commutes with
the action of ge and H2e. This shows that we could have used the sign ελ instead of
(−1)a(λ) in the isomorphism (5.3).

5.2. The modular Harish-Chandra series of GLm.

Recall that GLn := GLn(q2) denotes the ﬁnite general linear group over a ﬁnite

ﬁeld with q2 elements.

5.2.1. The unipotent modules of GLn. The set of unipotent characters of KGLn is

(5.4)

where

Unip(KGLn) = {Lλ | λ ∈ Pn},

Lλ = |Sn|−1 Xw∈Sn

and Tw is an Fq2-stable maximal torus of GLn of cycle-type ρ(w), with the convention
that T1 = T is the split torus of diagonal matrices. There is a unique labeling of the
simple unipotent modules of kGLn given by

As in the case of unitary groups (see Proposition 4.4), there exists a unique indecom-

posable unipotent OGLn-latticefWλ with character Lλ and such that Wλ := kfWλ is

indecomposable with simple head Sλ.

5.2.2. The modular Steinberg character and Harish-Chandra series. First, let us in-
troduce the following notation. Given non-negative integers mj with j > −1, we will
say that a partition λ of m is cuspidal of type (mj) if λ is of the following form

λ = (1(m−1), e(m0), (eℓ)(m1), (eℓ2)(m2), . . . )

in exponential notation.

41

For a partition λ as above, we consider the Levi subgroup of GLm given by

Recall that GLλ = GLλ(q2). The unipotent module S(1m) is the head of W(1n). Since
W(1n) is a modular reduction of the Steinberg character L(1m) of KGLm, we call S(1m)
the modular Steinberg representation of kGLm and we write Stm = S(1m). Let Stλ
be the kGLλ-module given by

GLλ = (GL1)m−1 ×Yj>0

(GLeℓj )mj .

Stλ = (St1)⊗m−1 ⊗Oj>0

(Steℓj )⊗mj .

The following result is due to Dipper, James and Dipper-Du [16], see also [8,

sec. 19].

Proposition 5.3.
(a) The cuspidal pairs of kGLm are the GLm-conjugates of the pairs (GLλ, Stλ)

where λ runs over the set of all cuspidal partitions of m.

(c) If λ is cuspidal of type (mj), then we have a k-algebra isomorphism

H (kGLm, Stλ) ≃ H1; q2

k,m−1 ⊗Oj>0

H1;1
k,mj

.

(cid:3)

Recall that here H1; u

k,m denotes the Hecke algebra of type Sm over k with parameter

u. In particular, we have H1; 1

k,m = kSm.

5.3. The Heisenberg functors.

For R = K or k we call the category of unipotent RGL-modules the category

VR =Mm∈N

RGLm -umod .

Recall that the vector space ΛΛΛ is equipped with the bilinear form h•, •iΛΛΛ. It induces
a bilinear form h•, •iV on [Vk] via the isomorphism of vector spaces

(5.6)

[Vk] ∼→ ΛΛΛ,

[Wλ] 7→ φλ.

42

O. DUDAS, M. VARAGNOLO, E. VASSEROT

Now, let us come back to the category Uk of unipotent modules of the unitary
group. Let h•, •iU be the unique bilinear form on [Uk] such that the map (5.3) is an
isometry.

Given n, r, m > 0 such that n = r + 2m, we write Lr,m ≃ Gr × GLm. Given a

unipotent RGLm-module X we consider the following functors

BX : RGr -umod → RGn -umod, M 7→ RGn
B∗

X : RGn -umod → RGr -umod, M 7→ HomRGLm(cid:0)X, ∗RGn

Lr,m(M ⊗ X),

Lr,m(M)(cid:1).

The functor B∗
X is right adjoint to BX. In the particular case where m = 1 and X = R
is the trivial module, we recover the functors F , E deﬁned in §4.2. The functor
BX is exact, hence it induces a C-linear endomorphism [BX ] of [Uk]. However,
the functor B∗
X is not exact and the module X may not have a ﬁnite projective
dimension in kGLm -umod. Hence, the right derived functor of B∗
X may not yield
any endomorphism of [Uk]. Nevertheless we can avoid this problem by deﬁning the
C-linear map

[B∗

X ] = h [X] , [∗RGn

Lr,m](•) iV : [kGn -umod] → [kGr -umod].

The Harish-Chandra induction relative to the subgroups GLn1 × GLn2 of GLn for
n1 + n2 = n yields a bifunctor • ⊙ • : VR ⊗ VR → VR.
Proposition 5.4. Let X, X ′ be objects in Vk.
(a) There is an isomorphism of functors BXBX ′ ≃ BX⊙X ′ ≃ BX ′BX .
X⊙X ′] = [B∗
(b) There is an equality of linear maps [B∗

5.4. The categoriﬁcation of the Heisenberg action on [Uk].

Recall that e is odd. The representation of H2e on [Uk] in §5.1.3 is determined
n with n a positive multiple of 2e satisfying the relations
m] = −n δn,m Id. In this section we will re-interpret

by linear operators bn, b∗
[bn, bm] = [b∗
some of these operators in representation theoretic terms using the category Uk.

m] = 0 and [bn, b∗

n, b∗

Now, ﬁx a positive integer m and a cuspidal partition λ of m. Consider the module

If we denote by Tλ an Fq2-stable maximal torus of GLm of cycle-type λ, the class of
Xλ coincides with the Deligne-Lusztig character induced from Tλ.
Lemma 5.5. If λ is a cuspidal partition of m then [Xλ] = RGLm

(1) in [Uk].

Tλ

Xλ = RGLm
GLλ

(Stλ) = RGLm

GLλ(cid:16)(St1)⊗m−1 ⊗Oj>0

(Steℓj )⊗mj(cid:17).

Proof. The ﬁnite group Tλ = Tλ(q2) is isomorphic to GL1(q2)m−1×Qj>0 GL1(q2eℓj )mj .

By [8, thm. 19.18], for each integer j > 0 there is a character θ of KGL1(q2eℓj ) of
order a power of ℓ such that we have

R

GLeℓj
T(eℓj )

(1) = dOGLR

GLeℓj
T(eℓj )

([θ]) = (−1)eℓj−1[Steℓj ] = [Steℓj ].

We deduce that RGLλ

[Xλ] = RGLm

(cid:3)

Given a cuspidal partition λ, we set Bλ = BXλ. Note that the endofunctor F of
Uk is equal to B1. The functor B∗
λ is not well-deﬁned, but we may still consider
the linear endomorphism [B∗
λ] of [Uk]. They are related to the Heisenberg operators
considered earlier by the following proposition (which will not be used in the rest of
the paper).

Proposition 5.6. Assume that ℓ 6= 2. Let λ be a cuspidal partition of m of type (mj)
with m−1 = 0. Then, we have the equalities b2λ = [Bλ] and b∗
λ] in End([Uk]).

2λ = [B∗

To prove the proposition we need more material. Fix a positive integer a. We

abbreviate GL(a)

m = GLm(q2a) and we consider the category

V (a)

R :=Mm∈N

RGL(a)

m -umod .

First, we view GL(a)

m as the group of Fq2a-rational points of the rational group

(GLm , Fq2a). Unipotent irreducible modules of KGLm and KGL(a)
by partitions of m. Therefore there is an isomorphism [Vk] ∼→ [V (a)
[W (a)
of [V ] under this map. By composition we obtain C-linear isomorphisms given by

] sending [Wµ] to
µ ] for any partition µ of m. More generally we will denote by [V (a)] the image

k

m are both parametrized

[V (a)

K ] ∼→ [V (a)

k

] ∼→ ΛΛΛ,

[L(a)

µ ] 7→ [W (a)

Next, we view GL(a)

m as the group of rational points of GL(a)

m = ((GLm)a , σaFq2),
where σa is the automorphism of (GLm)a such that (g1, g2, . . . , ga) 7→ (g2, . . . , ga, g1).
Note that GL(a)
m is a Levi subgroup of GLam = (GLam , Fq2), but the rational
structures are diﬀerent. The Lusztig induction and restriction yield C-linear maps

Let F a be the C-linear map ΛΛΛ → ΛΛΛ such that F a(zλ cλ) = zaλ caλ for each partition

Fa(cλ) = cµ if λ = aµ and Fa(cλ) = 0 if λ 6= aµ for all µ.

Proof. The proof of the lemma is standard, see, e.g., [63, prop. 6.1] or [4, sec. 3.A].
Let us give some details.

First, we prove part (a). We abbreviate n = am. Consider the rational groups
(GLn, Fq2) and ((GLm)a , σaFq2). We will denote them by G and G(a) respectively.
The Weyl groups of G and G are identiﬁed with Sn. The Weyl group of G(a) is
(Sm)a. Let σa denote also the permutation in Sn of cycle-type (am) which normalizes
the subgroup (Sm)a and induces the automorphism such that (w1, w2, . . . , wa) 7→
(w2, . . . , wa, w1). The action of the Frobenius homomorphism on the Weyl group of
G(a) is given by the conjugation by σa. The Weyl group of G(a) is Sm.

By (5.5) we have

[Lλ] =Xν ⊢ n

hφλ , cνiΛΛΛ RG

Hence, the isometry [Vk] ∼→ ΛΛΛ such that [Lλ] 7→ φλ maps the virtual module RG

G(a) : [V (a)

K ] → [VK]

is identiﬁed with the linear endomorphism F a of ΛΛΛ. This proves the ﬁrst identity in
part (a). The second one follows by adjunction.

Now, we prove part (b). Consider the Fq2-rational group (GLm+n, Fq2) with
its Fq2-stable Levi subgroup (GLm × GLn, Fq2). The isometry [KGLm -umod] →
CIrr(KSm) in (5.6) maps the virtual module RGLm
(1) to zµ cµ for each partition µ
of m. By the transitivity of Lusztig induction we get

Tµ

RGLm+n

GLm×GLnRGLm×GLn

Tµ×Tλ

(1) = RGLm+n
Tµ×Tλ

(1).

This proves the ﬁrst identity in part (b). The second one follows by adjunction.

It remains to prove part (c). Consider the Fq-rational group (GLn, F ) with its F -
stable Levi subgroup Lr,m. We will abbreviate Gn = (GLn, F ) and we will identify
the rational groups (Lr,m, F ) and (GLr × (GLm)2, (F, σ2Fq)), where σ2 is an element
of S2m of cycle-type (2m). Let wn denote the longest element in Sn. The Weyl
groups of GLn and Gn are identiﬁed with Sn and Wn = CSn(wn). The Weyl group
of Lr,m is identiﬁed with Sr × (Sm)2 with the action of the Frobenius endomorphism
F given by conjugation by (wr, σ2). Here, we embed Sr × (Sm)2 into Sn via the
map (u, v) 7→ (wmv1wm, u, v2) if v = (v1, v2) with v1, v2 ∈ Sm. The Weyl group of
Lr,m is identiﬁed with Wr × Sm.

From (4.2) we deduce that the isometry [UK] ∼→ ΛΛΛ such that χλ 7→ φλ maps
the virtual module RGr
In the proof of (a)
Tλ
we already observed that the isometry [VK] ∼→ ΛΛΛ in (5.7) maps the virtual module

Proof of Proposition 5.6. Let n = r + 2m. Under the isomorphism (5.6) and the
isomorphism [Uk] ∼→ ΛΛΛ given by ελ[Vλ] 7→ φλ, Lemma 5.7 identiﬁes the maps RGn
Lr,m
and ∗RGn
Lr,m between [Uk ⊗ Vk] and [Vk] with the C-linear maps ΛΛΛ ⊗ ΛΛΛ → ΛΛΛ and

Now, assume that λ is cuspidal of type (mj). By Lemmas 5.5, 5.7 the class of Xλ in
[Vk] is identiﬁed with the element zλcλ ∈ ΛΛΛ. From (5.1) we deduce that the operator
Lr,m (• ⊗ [Xλ]) on [Uk] is identiﬁed with the operators b2λ on ΛΛΛ. Hence,
(cid:3)

the proposition follows from Lemma 5.1 and Remark 5.2.

[Bλ] =Lr RGr+2m

5.5. Cuspidal modules and highest weight vectors.

By Proposition 4.20, the set of isomorphism classes of weakly cuspidal modules in
Uk is a basis of the space [Uk]0 of all elements in [Uk] which are killed by the map
[Ei] for each i ∈ Ie. We deﬁne

[Uk]hw = {x ∈ [Uk]0 | b∗

n(x) = 0, ∀n ∈ 2eZ>0}.

Then, we have the following inclusion.

Lemma 5.8. {[D] | D ∈ Irr(Uk) is cuspidal } ⊆ [Uk]hw.

Proof. For any partition λ we set

ν is invertible, we have

[Uk]hw ⊇ {x ∈ [Uk]0 | a∗

2λ(x) = 0, ∀λ ∈ P}.

Now, for any partition λ we set Aλ = BWλ and [A∗

Wλ]. Under the isomor-
phism [Uk] ≃ ΛΛΛ, the operator [Aλ] on [Uk] is identiﬁed by (5.8) with the operator

5.5.1. The parameters of the ramiﬁed Hecke algebras. It is not obvious that the vector
space [Uk]hw is spanned by classes of irreducible unipotent modules. Our goal is to
determine precisely the cuspidal modules. Let us ﬁrst recall the following basic facts.

Lemma 5.9.
(a) Any unipotent cuspidal pair of kGn is Gn-conjugate to a pair (Gr × GLλ , Dν ⊗
Stλ) where n = r + 2m, λ is a cuspidal partition of m and Dν is a unipotent
cuspidal kGr-module.

(b) Given a cuspidal pair (Gr × GLλ , Dν ⊗ Stλ) with λ of type (mj), the rami-
k,m−1 ⊗

ﬁed Hecke algebra H (kGn, Dν ⊗ Stλ) is isomorphic to the k-algebra HQt ; q2

, where the integer t ∈ N is such that the e-core of ν is ∆t.

Proof. Part (a) follows from Proposition 5.3. To prove (b), let ﬁrst observe that by
[32, prop. 4.4] we have an algebra isomorphism

Nj>0 H1,1 ; 1

k,mj

L(Λ)d = Mht(α)=d

L(Λ)Λ−α, B(Λ)d = Ght(α)=d

B(Λ)Λ−α.

We ﬁrst prove the following.

H (kGn, Dν ⊗ Stλ) ≃ HP−1 ; q2

where Pj = (aj, bj) is a parameter in k× × k× for each j > −1. Using the transitivity
and faithfulness of induction, see [8, prop. 1.23] for details, we deduce from Corollary
4.23 that P−1 = Qt for some t > 0. By [38, prop. 2.3.5]1 the parameter Pj is of the
form (aj, aj) for some element aj ∈ k× for each j > 0.
(cid:3)

5.5.2. The theorem. We can now formulate the theorem comparing cuspidal modules
and highest weight vectors.

Theorem 5.10. The set {[D] | D ∈ Irr(Uk) is cuspidal } is a basis of [Uk]hw.

Proof. First, let us ﬁx some notation that we will use in the whole proof. For every

sequence (m−1, m0, m1, . . . ) of integers > 0 we set m+ =Pj>0 mjℓj, m = m−1 + em+

and n = r + 2m. Let λ be the cuspidal partition of m of type (m−1, m0, . . . ) and
λ+ be the cuspidal partition of type (m0, m1, . . . ). Let C ⊆ P be the set of all
partitions ν such that the module Dν is cuspidal. For each ν ∈ C the e-core of ν is
a 2-core ∆t(ν). We will abbreviate ∆ν = ∆t(ν) and Qν = Qt(ν).

Now, we consider the Harish-Chandra series of kGn. The crystal basis B(Λ) of the
ge-module L(Λ) is a disjoint union of bases B(Λ)α of the weight subspaces L(Λ)Λ−α
where α runs over Q+

e . For each integer d > 0 we set

Claim 5.11. Given ν a partition, and m−1, m+ ≥ 0, we have a bijection

Irr(kGn, Dν ⊗ Stλ)

1:1←→ B(ΛQν )m−1 × Pm+

Gλ

where λ runs over all cuspidal partitions with ﬁxed m−1 and m+.

From Lemma 5.9 and the generalities in Section 3.4, we have a canonical bijection

Irr(kGn, Dν ⊗ Stλ)

1:1←→ Irr(HQν ; q2

k,m−1) ×Yj>0

By §1.4, there is a canonical bijection

(5.10)

B(ΛQν )m−1

k,m−1 ).

Further, the elements of Irr(H1,1 ; 1
) are labelled by the ℓ-restricted partitions of mj,
k,mj
see, e.g., [33, prop. 4.6.6]. Hence, the unicity of the ℓ-adic expansion of partitions
yields the following bijection

(5.11)

Pm+

1:1←→Gλ+Yj>0

Irr(H1,1 ; 1

where λ+ = (em0, (eℓ)m1, . . .) runs over all cuspidal partitions of m+ with parts
divisible by e (see, e.g., [7, lem. 19.26]). The Claim 5.11 follows from (5.9), (5.10)
and (5.11).

Now, we consider the complexiﬁed Grothendieck group [Uk]. The modular Harish-

Chandra theory yields bijections

(5.12)

Irr(Uk)

Irr(kGn, Dν ⊗ Stλ).

1:1←→ Gn,ν,λ

Next, we identify [Uk] with the ge-moduleLt F(Qt). Fix a basis B of [Uk]hw contain-

ing the family {[Dν] | ν ∈ C }. By Corollary 4.23 we can identify the g′
e-submodule
of [Uk] generated by [Dν] with L(ΛQν ). We get a canonical isomorphism of H2e ⊕ g′
e-
modules

(5.13)

U(H2e)U(g′

e)(b).

For each n let [Uk]n be the subspace of [Uk] given by

[Uk] =Mν∈C

U(H2e)(L(ΛQν )) ⊕ Mb∈B\C
[Uk]n = Mν,m−1,m+,γ

b2eγ(L(ΛQν )m−1),

where γ ∈ Pm+ and r, m−1, m+ ∈ N are such that n = r + 2m−1 + 2em+. Comparing
(5.12) and (5.13), we deduce that

|Irr(kGn, Dν ⊗ Stλ)| > dim([Uk]n),

and that we have equality for all n if and only if B = {[Dν] | ν ∈ C }.

Now, any non-zero highest-weight H2e-module is free as a module over the subal-

gebra generated by {b2en | n > 1}. Hence, for each n, the Claim 5.11 gives

proving the theorem.

|Irr(kGn, Dν ⊗ Stλ)| = dim([Uk]n),

(cid:3)

Remark 5.12. The theorem implies that

{ [D] | D ∈ Irr(Uk) is cuspidal} = Irr(Uk) ∩ [Uk]hw.

5.5.3. Cuspidal modules and FLOTW e-partitions. Recall that in Theorem 4.21 we
have given an explicit isomorphism between the crystal basis B(Uk), whose under-

lying set is Irr(Uk), and the abstract crystal Be of the ge × H2e-moduleLt F(Qt)e.
e :=Ft B∨(st) ofLt F(Qt)e, see §2.3.2, are highest weight vectors for the action

Using Theorem 5.10, we deduce that the cuspidal modules in Irr(Uk) corresponds
precisely to the elements of Be whose associated elements in the upper global basis
B∨
of both ge and H2e.

These elements of Be have been computed recently in [35]. To do so, one deﬁnes a
class of e-partitions called FLOTW, see [35, def. 6.22]. Then, the cuspidal modules
are related to FLOTW e-partitions as in [35, thm. 7.7].

6. Types B and C

This section is devoted to the construction of categorical actions on the category of
unipotent representations of the ﬁnite groups SO2n+1(q) and Sp2n(q). The arguments
are similar to those in Section 4 and will yield:
(1) the Hecke algebras associated to weakly cuspidal representations,
(2) the branching graph for the parabolic induction and restriction,
(3) derived equivalences between blocks.
The main diﬀerence is the lack of a description in terms of level 1 Fock spaces (given
by Ennola duality, see §4). In particular, the grading by the imaginary roots, which
in Section 4 was deduced from the grading in the GLn case, is constructed in types
B, C via some explicit combinatorics in terms of Lusztig’s symbols.

6.1. Deﬁnitions. Throughout this section and the following, q is any prime power.
Note however that we will assume that q is odd starting from Section 6.3.

6.1.1. Odd-dimensional orthogonal groups. Let Jn be as in §4.1. It is the matrix of
a non-degenerate quadratic form. The odd-dimensional orthogonal group SO2n+1 =
SO2n+1(Fq) is

SO2n+1(Fq) = {g ∈ SL2n+1 | tgJ2n+1g = J2n+1}.

It is a connected reductive group of type Bn. The standard Frobenius map F = Fq
on GL2n+1 induces a Frobenius endomorphism on SO2n+1. The ﬁnite orthogonal
group SO2n+1(q) is given by

SO2n+1(q) = (SO2n+1)F .

The subgroup of diagonal matrices T (resp. upper-triangular matrices B) in SO2n+1
is a split maximal torus (resp.
an F -stable Borel subgroup). Note that T =
{diag(tn, . . . , t1, 1, t−1
n )}. The Weyl group W of (SO2n+1, T) is a Weyl group
of type Bn, and F acts trivially on it. For numbering the simple reﬂections of W we
will take the following convention:

For i 6= 1, the action of si on diag(tn, . . . , t1, 1, t−1

whereas s1 swaps t1 and t−1
1 . For i 6= 1, the simple reﬂection si can be lifted to
NSO2n+1(T) as the permutation matrix (n − i + 1, n − i + 2)(n + i, n + i + 1) and s1
as the signed permutation matrix

It is a connected reductive groups of type Cn. The standard Frobenius map F = Fq
on GL2n induces a Frobenius endomorphism on Sp2n. The ﬁnite symplectic group
Sp2n(q) is given by

Sp2n(q) = (Sp2n)F .

The subgroup of diagonal matrices T (resp. upper-triangular matrices B) in Sp2n
is a split maximal torus (resp.
an F -stable Borel subgroup). Note that T =
{diag(tn, . . . , t1, t−1

of type Bn, and F acts trivially on it. For numbering the simple reﬂections of W we
will take the same convention as in (6.1).

As in the case of odd-dimensional orthogonal groups, the action of si on the element
diag(tn, . . . , t1, t−1

t−1
1 . For i 6= 1, we will lift si to NSp2n(T) as the permutation matrix (n − i + 1, n −
i + 2)(n + i − 1, n + i) and s1 as the signed permutation matrix

6.2. The representation datum on RG-mod.

Throughout this section we assume that R is any commutative domain in which

q(q − 1) is invertible.

Given a positive integer n, we will denote by Gn and Gn either the odd-dimensional
orthogonal groups SO2n+1 and SO2n+1(q) or the symplectic groups Sp2n and Sp2n(q).
In addition, we set G0 = {1} by convention.

Given r, m ∈ N such that n = r + m, let Lr,m and Lr,1m be the standard Levi
subgroups of Gn corresponding to the sets of simple reﬂexions {sk | k 6= r + 1},
{sk | k ≤ r} respectively. The corresponding ﬁnite groups are Lr,m ≃ Gr × GLm(q)
and Lr,1m ≃ Gr × GL1(q)m. We will abbreviate Lr = Lr,1.
It is isomorphic to
Gr × GL1 via the map

(g, λ) 7−→

Let Pr ⊂ Gr+1 be the corresponding parabolic subgroup and Pr = PF
the unipotent radical of Pr and Vr = VF

r . Let Vr be
r . Let us consider the subgroup Ur ⊂ Gr+1

52

given by

O. DUDAS, M. VARAGNOLO, E. VASSEROT

Ur = Vr ⋊ F×
q .

It is represented by the same ﬁgure as in (4.1). For each r < n we set Un,r =
Un−1 ⋊ · · · ⋊ Ur and en,r = eUn,r . The embedding of Gr into Lr yields an embedding
of Gr into Gr+1, and by induction, of Gr into Gn. We obtain functors

Fn,r = RGn · en,r ⊗RGr • : RGr -mod → RGn -mod,
Er,n = en,r · RGn ⊗RGn • : RGn -mod → RGr -mod .

An endomorphism of the functor Fn,r can be represented by an (RGn, RGr)-bimodule
endomorphism of RGn · en,r, or, equivalently, by an element of en,r · RGn · en,r cen-
tralizing RGr. Thus, the elements

(6.2)

Xr+1,r = qrer+1,r(sr+1sr · · · s1 · · · srsr+1) er+1,r,

Tr+2,r = qer+2,rsr+2 er+2,r

deﬁne respectively natural transformations of the functors Fr+1,r and Fr+2,r. Indeed,
with our convention sr+1sr · · · s1 · · · srsr+1 is one of the matrices

which centralize Gr. We set

Proposition 6.1. The endomorphisms X ∈ End(F ) and T ∈ End(F 2) satisfy the
following relations:
(a) 1F T ◦ T 1F ◦ 1F T = T 1F ◦ 1F T ◦ T 1F ,
(b) (T + 1F 2) ◦ (T − q1F 2) = 0,
(c) T ◦ (1F X) ◦ T = qX1F .

Proof. Similar to the proof of [18, prop. 4.1].

(cid:3)

6.3. The categories of unipotent modules UK and Uk.

From now on, we ﬁx an ℓ-modular system (K, O, k) which we assume to be big
enough so that every indecomposable unipotent representation of Gn (over K or k)
is absolutely indecomposable. Such a modular system exists since unipotent repre-
sentations of Gn are deﬁned over Qℓ, see [55, cor. 1.12]. In addition, since we will
be dealing with representations in non-deﬁning characteristic, we will always assume
that ℓ 6= p. We denote by f (resp. d) the order of q (resp. q2) in k×. If f is odd, we

53

say that the prime number ℓ is linear, otherwise we say that ℓ is unitary. In the ﬁrst
case we have f = d, whereas in the second one f = 2d.

From now on, we will always assume that both p and ℓ are odd, and that f > 1. In
particular q(q − 1) ∈ O × and we can apply the previous constructions with R being
any ring among (K, O, k).

6.3.1. Parametrization by symbols. By [53], the unipotent characters of Gn are parametrized
by symbols. For our purpose it will be more convenient to work with a slightly dif-
ferent notion which we refer to as charged symbols.

A charged symbol Θ with charge s = (s1, s2) is a pair of charged β-sets Θ =
(βs1(µ1), βs2(µ2)) for some bipartition µ = (µ1, µ2). We abbreviate Θ = βs(µ). If
βs1(µ1) =: X = {x1 > x2 > · · · } and βs2(µ2) =: Y = {y1 > y2 > · · · } we write

Θ = (X, Y ) = (cid:18) x1 x2

y1 y2

· · ·

· · · (cid:19) .

for the symbol associated with (X, Y ). The rank of the symbol is the rank of any
charged symbol in its class whereas its defect is |D| where D is the defect of any rep-
resentative. Removing and adding d-hooks or d-cohooks are well-deﬁned operations
on symbols.

We denote by S the set of symbols and by Sodd the set of symbols of odd defects.

The components X and Y are called the ﬁrst and second row of the symbol. The
defect of Θ is D = s1 − s2 and its rank is |µ| + ⌊D2/4⌋.

A d-hook of Θ is a pair of integers (x, x + d) which is either a d-hook of X or a
d-hook of Y . The charged symbol obtained by deleting x + d from X (resp. Y ) and
replacing it by x is said to be gotten from Θ by removing the d-hook (x, x + d). A
d-cohook is a pair of integers (x, x + d) such that x + d ∈ X and x 6∈ Y , or x + d ∈ Y
and x 6∈ X. The charged symbol obtained by deleting x + d from X (resp. Y )
and adding x to Y (resp. X) is said to be gotten from Θ by removing the d-cohook
(x, x + d). The d-core of Θ is obtained by removing recursively all d-hooks from Θ.
A similar deﬁnition using d-cohooks gives the d-cocore of Θ.

We will denote by Θ† = (Y, X) the charged symbol of charge (s2, s1) obtained by
swapping the two β-sets. The defect of Θ† is −D but the rank is the same. If one
shifts simultaneously the charged β-sets X and Y by an integer m, one obtains a
symbol Θ[m] of charge (s1 + m, s2 + m). This operation does not change the defect
nor the rank.

Symbols are orbits of charged symbols under the shift operator and the transfor-

mation Θ 7→ Θ†. We write

{X, Y } = (cid:26) x1 x2

6.3.2. The unipotent modules over K. Fix a positive integer n. The unipotent KGn-
modules were classiﬁed in [53, thm. 8.2]. They are parametrized in terms of symbols
of odd defect and rank n. This parametrization follows from the determination of
cuspidal unipotent KGn-modules and their ramiﬁed Hecke algebras.

Proposition 6.2 (Lusztig [53]). Up to isomorphism, there is at most one cuspidal
unipotent module in KGr -mod, and there exists one if and only if r = t(t + 1) for
some t > 0. It is denoted by Et.
(cid:3)

Since there do not exist any cuspidal unipotent character of GLn(q) unless n = 1,
we deduce that any cuspidal pair of Gn is conjugate to a pair of the form (Lr,1m , Et)
with n = r + m and r = t(t + 1) with t > 0. The general theory recalled in §3.4
implies that the irreducible characters lying in the Harish-Chandra series above Et
are in bijection with the irreducible representations of the ramiﬁed Hecke algebra
H (KGn, Et). To describe explicitly the latter, we introduce, as in (4.3), the param-
eters

Then H (KGn, Et) is isomorphic to HQt ; q
K,m by [53, §5,8]. There is a canonical choice
for this isomorphism given by Theorem 6.5 below. Consequently, the Harish-Chandra
theory yields a canonical bijection

(6.4)

Irr(KGn, Et)

1:1←→ Irr(HQt ; q
K,m )

and hence a parametrization of Irr(KGn, Et). More precisely, given µ = (µ1, µ2) a
bipartition of m and t > 0 we can associate the symbol

So, the defect and the rank of Θt(µ) are

Θt(µ) =(cid:8)βt(µ1), β−t−1(µ2)(cid:9).

D(Θt(µ)) = 2t + 1,

rk(Θt(µ)) = m + t(t + 1).

Then we deﬁne EΘt(µ) to be the unipotent KGr-module corresponding to S(µ)Qt ; q
via the bijection (6.4). This yields a parametrization of the irreducible unipotent
KGn-modules as

K

{EΘt(µ) | t ∈ N , µ ∈ P 2

m , m + t(t + 1) = n}.

We will abbreviate Θt = Θt(∅). Note that Et = EΘt.

Proposition 6.3 (Lusztig [53]). The irreducible unipotent characters are parametrized
by symbols of odd defect. If n = r + m and r = t(t + 1) with t > 0, then the unipotent
module EΘ lies in the Harish-Chandra series Irr(KGn, Et) if and only if Θ has defect
2t + 1 and rank n.
(cid:3)

55

It is important to observe that this parametrization is exactly the one described in
[53, thm. 8.2], which was subsequently used for the determination of blocks in [23].
Indeed, the labelling of unipotent characters by bipartitions or symbols in [53] (see
also [9, §13.8]) corresponds to the presentation of the Hecke algebra H (KGn, Et) in
terms of the set of generators (T0, T1, . . . , Tm−1) instead of (X1, T1, . . . , Tm−1) with
T0 = (−1)tqt+1X1 so that (T0 − q2t+1)(T0 + 1) = 0. Now the isomorphism HQt ; q
K,m ≃
H(q2t+1,−1) ; q
7−→
S(µ)(q2t+1,−1).

induces a bijection on irreducible objects which is just S(µ)Qt

K,m

Remark 6.4. Note that Q†
t = Q−1−t, Θt(µ) = Θ−1−t(µ†) and t(t + 1) is invariant
under the map t 7−→ −t − 1. We will work with symbols Θt(µ) such that t > 0. We
might also have worked with t < 0 using the symmetries above.

Recall that G0 = {1}. We call the category of unipotent KG-modules the category

UK =Mn∈N

KGn -umod .

This category is abelian semisimple. From the previous discussion we have

where by convention Irr(KG0) = {E0}.

Irr(UK) = {EΘ | Θ ∈ Sodd},

6.3.3. The unipotent modules over k. Using the ℓ-modular system we have decom-
position maps dOGn which by Proposition 3.4 and since ℓ is odd, restrict to linear
isomorphisms

dOGn : [KGn -umod] ∼→ [kGn -umod].

We call the category of unipotent kG-modules the category

Uk =Mn∈N

kGn -umod .

This is an abelian category which is not semisimple. As above, the decomposition
map yields a Z-linear isomorphism dU : [UK] ∼→ [Uk]. It is conjectured that this
map is unitriangular on the basis of irreducible modules, yielding a parametrization
of unipotent simple kG-modules (see Conjecture 6.21 below).

6.3.4. The unipotent blocks. Recall that d is the order of q2 modulo ℓ. The partition
of the unipotent KGn-modules into ℓ-blocks was determined in [23, (10B), (11E)].
If ℓ is a linear prime (resp. a unitary prime), i.e., if f is odd (resp. even), then two
unipotent characters of KGn belong to the same ℓ-block if and only if their symbols
have the same d-core (resp. d-cocore).

56

O. DUDAS, M. VARAGNOLO, E. VASSEROT

In addition, Fong-Srinivasan described the structure of the unipotent blocks of Gn
with cyclic defect groups. First, the unipotent ℓ-block containing EΘ has a cyclic
defect if and only if the symbol Θ has a unique d-hook if ℓ is linear or a unique
d-cohook if ℓ is unitary. In this case, let {X, Y } be the d-core of Θ if ℓ is linear, and
the d-cocore of Θ if ℓ is unitary. By [24, (5A), (6A)], the Brauer tree of the ℓ-block
containing EΘ is

ρa

ρa−1

ρ1

χexc

ηb−1

ηb

where

(a) if ℓ is linear, then f = d = a = b and ρk (resp. ηk) is obtained by adding a

d-hook to X (resp. Y ) for each k = 1, . . . , d.

(b) if ℓ is unitary, then f = 2d, ρ1, . . . , ρa are the unipotent characters corre-
sponding to the symbols obtained by adding a d-cohook which increases |X|
and η1, . . . , ηb are the unipotent characters corresponding to the symbols ob-
tained by adding a d-cohook which increases |Y |. In addition, a = d + D and
b = d − D where D is the defect of the symbol.

6.4. The g∞-representation on UK.

We show in this section that the representation datum on KG -mod yields a cate-

gorical action of g∞ on UK.

6.4.1. The ramiﬁed Hecke algebra. Let r = t(t + 1) and n = r + m with t, m > 0.
Recall that the inﬂation from Gr to Lr,1m yields an equivalence between KGr -umod
and KLr,1m -umod which intertwines the functor Fn,r with the parabolic induction
RGn

Lr,1m . In particular, we have a canonical isomorphism

H (KGn, Et) := EndKGn(F m(Et))op ∼→ EndKGn(RGn

Lr,1m (Et))op.

This algebra is isomorphic to the Hecke algebra of type Bm with parameters q and Qt,
giving a parametrisation of the constituents of (the head of) F m(Et) in terms of bipar-
titions. More precisely, recall from §1.3 that to the categorical datum (E, F, X, T ) is
attached a map φF m : Hq
K,m → End(F m). The evaluation of this map at the module
Et yields a K-algebra homomorphism

φK,m : Hq

K,m → H (KGn, Et), Xk 7→ Xk(Et), Tl 7→ Tl(Et).

We show that it induces the aforementioned isomorphism.

Theorem 6.5. Let t, m > 0 and n = t(t + 1) + m. Then the map φK,m factors
through a K-algebra isomorphism HQt ; q
K,m

∼−→ H (KGn, Et).

57

Proof. The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 4.8, see [18, thm. 4.12]. Write
Qt = (Q1, Q2) and X = X(Et). We must check that the operator X on F (Et)
satisﬁes the relation

(X − (−q)−1−t)(X − (−q)t) = 0.

Then the invertibility of the morphism HQt ; q
fact, it is shown there that X satiﬁes the relation

K,m → H (KGn, Et) follows from [42]. In

(6.5)

(X − ǫt (−q)−1−t)(X − ǫt (−q)t) = 0

for some ǫt = ±1. Therefore we must show that ǫt = 1 for all t ≥ 0, which we will do
by induction on t. First observe that the eigenvalues of X1,0 on RG1
G0(K) are 1, (−q)−1
and thus are powers of −q. Now ﬁx t ≥ 1 and assume that for all t > s > 0 the
eigenvalues of X(Es) on F (Es) are powers of −q. We will show that the eigenvalues
of X(Et) are also powers of −q using the modular representation theory of Gn.

Recall that K is chosen with respect to an ℓ-modular system (K, O, k). Since the
parametrization of unipotent characters does not depend on ℓ and (E, F, X, T ) are
deﬁned over Z[1/q(q − 1)], we can ﬁrst choose a speciﬁc prime number ℓ and prove
that the eigenvalues of X(Et) are powers of −q modulo ℓ. We choose ℓ to be odd
and such that the order of q in k× is f := 4t. Thus the order of q2 is d = 2t. Note
that ℓ is a unitary prime.

Set r = t(t + 1) and n = r + 1. The cuspidal representation Et is attached to the

symbol

Θt = (cid:26) t

t − 1 t − 2 · · · −t −t − 1 · · ·

−t − 1 · · · (cid:27)

Since only one d-cohook can be removed from Θt, the ℓ-block of Et has cyclic defect
groups. Moreover, the d-cocore of Θt equals Θt−1. Consequently, the Brauer tree of
the ℓ-block of Et is

where a symbol Ξk of ρk is obtained by adding the d-cohook (k, k + d) to Θt−1 for

Here the notationbk means that the integer k has been removed. This symbol has

ρk all lie in the Harish-Chandra series above Et−2 (recall the convention E−1 := E0).

Furthermore, the bipartition µk such that Θt−2(µk) = Ξk is ((1t−1−k), (k + 3t − 1)),
except when t = 1 in which case µk = ((k + 2), (1−k)).

The KGr-module Et is cuspidal, hence weakly cuspidal.

It follows that all the
composition factors of any ℓ-reduction of Et are weakly cuspidal as well. In particular

E(S) = 0.

For each k we can compute the character E(ρk) obtained by removing a 1-hook from
Ξk. Two cases arise: if k = 1 − 3t or k = t − 1, then E(ρk) is irreducible, and the
corresponding symbols are equal respectively to

We deduce thatP(−1)k[E(ρk)] = 0 in [KGr−1 -mod]. Since [S′] =P(−1)kdU ([ρk])

in [kGr−1 -mod], this implies that

E(S′) = 0.

Therefore, the two composition factors S, S′ of the ℓ-reduction of the exceptional
characters are weakly cuspidal, which forces the exceptional characters to be weakly
cuspidal as well.

Given a symbol Θ, the module F (EΘ) is the sum of the unipotent characters
associated to the symbols obtained from Θ by adding a 1-hook. Thus, we have
F (Et) = EΞ ⊕ EΞ′, where

Let B, B′ be the ℓ-blocks of EΞ and EΞ′ respectively and b, b′ be the corresponding
idempotents in KGn. Since the d-cocores of Ξ and Ξ′ are diﬀerent, the idempotents
b and b′ are orthogonal. Moreover X(Et) has the eigenvalues ǫt(−q)−1−t and ǫt(−q)t,

59

on bF (Et) = EΞ and b′F (Et) = EΞ′ respectively. Note that ǫt(−q)−1−t and ǫt(−q)t
are not congruent modulo ℓ since q2t+1 ≡ −q.

Let χ be an exceptional character. Recall that S is isomorphic to any ℓ-reduction
of Et. Since it is a composition factor of the ℓ-reduction of χ, we deduce that both
bF (χ) and b′F (χ) are non-zero. Since χ is weakly cuspidal, by the Mackey formula
F (χ) has at most two irreducible constituents and X(χ) at most two eigenvalues
whose product equals −q−1. We deduce that F (χ) = bF (χ) ⊕ b′F (χ). In addition,
the eigenvalues of X(χ) must be congruent to the eigenvalues of X(S) on F (S),
which are equal to ǫt(−q)−1−t and ǫt(−q)t. Now, S′ is a composition factor of the
ℓ-reduction of χ so one of bF (S′) or b′F (S′) must be non-zero, and therefore X(S′)
must have an eigenvalue congruent to ǫt(−q)−1−t or ǫt(−q)t. To conclude that ǫt = 1,
we must compute the possible eigenvalues of X(ρ1−3t) on bF (ρ1−3t) and b′F (ρ1−3t)
and use that S′ is a composition factor of the ℓ-reduction of ρ1−3t.

We abbreviate ρ = ρ1−3t. The Harish-Chandra induction of ρ is F (ρ) = EΘ ⊕

Since ρ belong to the Harish-Chandra series above Et−2, we can compute the eigen-

because q2t is congruent to −1 modulo ℓ. We deduce that the eigenvalues of the
operator X(ρ1−3t) on EΘ, EΘ′ are congruent to (−q)−1−t and (−q)t modulo ℓ. By
the above argument, at least one of these must be congruent to ǫt(−q)−1−t or ǫt(−q)t,

Y (µ) \ Y (λ) and Y (µ′) \ Y (λ) are −1 and −q−3 respectively, which are congruent to
q−2 and −q since q2 is congruent to −1 modulo ℓ. Therefore ǫ1 = 1.

6.5. The g2d-representation on Uk.

We now turn to the case of unipotent representations in positive characteristic.
We ﬁrst deduce from the previous construction a categorical action of the derived
Kac-Moody algebra g′
2d on Uk. We then show how to extend this action depending
on the parity of f . This reﬂects the diﬀerence between the case of linear primes (f
odd) and unitary primes (f even).

6.5.1. The g′
2d-representation on Uk. Recall that (K, O, k) is an ℓ-modular system
with K ⊃ Qℓ and k ⊃ Fℓ. We still work under the assumption that ℓ ∤ q and ℓ and q
are odd. Recall that d (resp. f ) is the order of q2 (resp. q) modulo ℓ.

Deﬁnition 6.8. Let I2d be the quiver obtained from I∞ by specialization O → k.
We deﬁne g′

2d to be the derived Kac-Moody algebra associated to the quiver I2d.

If f is odd then f = d and −1 cannot be expressed as a power of q in k. In that
case the quiver I2d decomposes as I2d = Id,1 ⊔ Id,2 with Id,1 = qZ and Id,2 = −qZ
being both cyclic quivers of size d. This yields a Lie algebra isomorphism

such that (α∨

If f is even, then f = 2d and qd = −1. Hence I2d = qZ is a cyclic quiver of size 2d

sums Ei =Lsp(j)=i Ej and Fi =Lsp(j)=i Fj give well-deﬁned operators on F(Qt)∞.

(cid:3)

Proof. The proposition is a direct application of Theorem 6.7, once we have proved
that the decomposition map dU is a vector space isomorphism. This is known by
Theorem 3.4 since ℓ is odd.
(cid:3)

In order to prove that this, and the representation datum (E, F, X, T ) on Uk
2d-representation, it remains to see that weight

introduced in §6.2, endow Uk with a g′
spaces are sums of blocks. This follows from the following lemma.

Lemma 6.10. Let t, s > 0 and µ, λ be bipartitions. If EΘt(µ) and EΘs(λ) are in the
same ℓ-block then |µ, Qti2d and |λ, Qsi2d have the same weight for the action of g′
2d.

Proof. Recall that if f is even (resp. odd), two unipotent characters of Gn lie in the
same ℓ-block if and only if the corresponding symbols have the same d-cocore (resp.
d-core), see §6.3.4. Therefore it is enough to show that adding/removing d-cohooks
(resp. d-hooks) does not aﬀect the weight of |µ, Qti2d for the action of g′

2d.

Write Qt = (Q1, Q2) and µ = (µ1, µ2). Using Proposition 2.2 and (2.4) one can
compute the weight of |µ, Qti2d from the β-set β0(µ). For i ∈ I2d and N large enough,
we have

hwt(cid:0)|µ, Qti2d(cid:1), α∨

i i = |{β ∈ β0(µ1), β > −N | qβQ1 ≡ i mod ℓ}|

− |{β ∈ β0(µ1), β > −N + 1 | qβQ1 ≡ qi mod ℓ}|
+ |{β ∈ β0(µ2), β > −N | qβQ2 ≡ i mod ℓ}|
− |{β ∈ β0(µ2), β > −N + 1 | qβQ2 ≡ qi mod ℓ}|.

This expression becomes simpler when working with the charged β-sets used in the
deﬁnition of Θt(µ) in §6.3.2. Write Θt(µ) = {X, Y } where X = βt(µ1) and Y =

β−1−t(µ2). Then by deﬁnition of Qt we have, for N large enough

hwt(cid:0)|µ, Qti2d(cid:1), α∨

i i = |{x ∈ X, x > −N | qx ≡ (−1)ti mod ℓ}|

− |{x ∈ X, x > −N + 1 | qx ≡ (−1)tqi mod ℓ}|
+ |{y ∈ Y, y > −N | qy ≡ (−1)t+1i mod ℓ}|
− |{y ∈ Y, y > −N + 1 | qy ≡ (−1)t+1qi mod ℓ}|.

63

If f is odd, then qd = qf = 1 in k and adding or removing a d-hook has the
eﬀect of removing x from X (resp. Y ) and adding x ± d to X (resp. Y ), which
does not change the congruence of qx. In particular, this operation does not aﬀect

wt(cid:0)|µ, Qti2d(cid:1).

If f is even, then qd = −1, qf = 1 and adding or removing a d-cohook has the
eﬀect of removing x from X (resp. Y ) and adding x ± d to Y (resp. x). This changes
qx to qx±d ≡ −qx. Therefore if t′ = t ± 1 and Θt′(µ′) is the symbol obtained from
Θt(µ) by adding or removing a d-cohook we have

wt(cid:0)|µ, Qti2d(cid:1), α∨

i i = wt(cid:0)|µ′, Qt′i2d(cid:1), α∨

−ii.

In particular, symbols corresponding to unipotent characters in the same ℓ-block
have the same weight.
(cid:3)

Notice that the lemma implies that the simple unipotent modules are weight vec-
2d-action. From this and the results in the previous section we deduce

tors of the g′
the expected result.

Theorem 6.11. Recall that ℓ and q are odd, and ℓ ∤ q(q2 − 1). The representation
datum on Uk yields a g′
[UK] → [Uk]
intertwines the representations of g∞ and g′
2d-module isomorphism
∼→ [Uk] sending |µ, Qti2d to dU ([EΘt(µ)]). Further, the classes in [Uk]

For t ∈ N, the Fock space F(Qt)2d has a tensor product decomposition into level 1

Fock spaces

F(Qt)2d ≃ F((−q)t)d ⊗ F((−q)−1−t)d.

Out of the charged Fock spaces (F((−q)t)d, t) and (F((−q)−1−t)d, −1 − t) and the

isomorphismeg2d ≃ (bsld)⊕2 (which depends on the parity of t) we can therefore equip
F(Qt)2d with an action ofeg2d which in turn restricts to an action of g2d.

Recall that two unipotent characters are in the same ℓ-block if and only if the
corresponding symbols have the same d-core. In particular, the unipotent characters
of a given unipotent block all lie in the same Harish-Chandra series. In addition, two
unipotent characters lying in diﬀerent Harish-Chandra series lie in diﬀerent blocks.
Consequently, for each t ∈ N we can form the category Uk,t associated with the
Harish-Chandra series labelled by t, yielding

Uk =Mt∈N

Uk,t with

[Uk] ≃ F(Qt)2d.

Using the action of g2d on F(Qt)2d deﬁned above we equip each [Uk,t] with a structure
of g2d-module which extends the structure of g′
2d-module deﬁned in §6.5.1. The
situation is completely similar to §4.6.1 and we get the following theorem.

Theorem 6.12. Recall that ℓ and q are odd, and ℓ ∤ q(q2 − 1). Assume that f is
odd. For each t ∈ N, the Harish-Chandra induction and restriction functors yield a
representation of g2d on Uk,t which categoriﬁes F(Qt)2d.
(cid:3)

6.5.3. Combinatorics of d-cohooks and d-cocores. We now concentrate on the unitary
prime case, i.e., the case where f is even, which is the most delicate. We wish to
deﬁne an action of a (non derived) Kac-Moody algebra g2d on [Uk] which extends the
action of g′
2d. Then, we will extend the grading of [Uk] from P2d to X2d = P2d ⊕ Zδ/2.
Before this, we must introduce some combinatorial tools related to symbols.

Let µ = (µ1, µ2) be a bipartition and t ∈ Z. Consider the symbol Θ deﬁned by

Θ = {X , Y − d} = Θt(µ)

where X = βt(µ1) and Y = βd−1−t(µ2). With this notation, removing a d-cohook on
Θ changes the pair (X, Y ) to

(X r {x}, Y ⊔ {x})

or

(X ⊔ {y − 2d}, Y r {y}).

We denote by s = (s1, . . . , s2d) and r = (r1, . . . , r2d) the 2d-core of the charged par-
titions (µ1, t) and (µ2, d−1−t) respectively, and by (µ1,1, . . . , µ1,2d) and (µ2,1, . . . , µ2,2d)
their 2d-quotients. Hence, we have

65

τ2d(µ1, t) = (µ1,1, . . . , µ1,2d, s1, . . . , s2d),
τ2d(µ2, d − 1 − t) = (µ2,1, . . . , µ2,2d, r1, . . . , r2d).

Lemma 6.13. The symbol Θ is a d-cocore if and only if
(a) µ1 and µ2 are 2d-cores,
(b) rp − sp ∈ {0, 1} for all p ∈ {1, . . . , 2d}.

Proof. Let us write X = βt(µ1) and Y = βd−1−t(µ2). Then Θ is a d-cocore if and
only if X ⊂ Y ⊂ X + 2d. In particular, we must have X ⊂ X + 2d and Y ⊂ Y + 2d,
which is equivalent to µ1 and µ2 being 2d-cores. In that case we have

X =

2dGp=1

2dGp=1

(p − 2d + 2dβsp(∅))

and Y =

(p − 2d + 2dβrp(∅)).

Using the deﬁnition of the β-set of an empty partition we deduce that X ⊂ Y if and
only if sp 6 rp for all p. For the same reason, we have Y ⊂ X + 2d if and only if
rp 6 sp + 1 for all p. The combination of the two conditions gives

rp − sp ∈ {0, 1},

for all p.

(cid:3)

Lemma 6.14. Let Θ, Θ′ be two symbols. The following assertions are equivalent:
(i) there exists a sequence of symbols Θ = Θ0, Θ1, . . . , Θm = Θ′ where Θi+1 is

obtained from Θi by adding or removing a d-cohook,

(ii) s + r = s′ + r′.

Proof. Let µ be the bipartition such that Θ = Θt(µ). We write

βt(µ1) =

(p − 2d + 2dβsp(µ1,p))

2dGp=1

and βd−1−t(µ2) =

(p − 2d + 2dβrp(µ2,p)).

2dGp=1

Therefore adding or removing a d-cohook changes (sp, rp) to (sp, rp) ± (1, −1) for
some p ∈ {1, . . . , 2d}. This does not change s + r.

Let Θ◦, Θ′

◦ be the d-cocore of Θ, Θ′, and (s◦, r◦), (s′

◦, r′

◦) be the corresponding

2d-cores. By the previous argument, we have

Now, assertion (i) is equivalent to Θ◦ = Θ′

◦, which yields in particular

s + r = s◦ + r◦,

s′ + r′ = s′

◦ + r′
◦.

s + r = s◦ + r◦ = s′ + r′.

6.5.4. The weight of a symbol. We are still working under the assumption that f = 2d
is even. In particular qd = −1 in k. Fix an integer t ∈ Z and set

Pt = qct = (qt , −q−1−t),

ct = (t, d − 1 − t).

In particular Qt = (−1)tPt. Let µ be a bipartition and let s and r be the 2d-
cores of the charged partitions (µ1, t) and (µ2, d − 1 − t). We consider the weight in
X = P ⊕ Z δ/2 given by

(6.6)

wt(µ, t) = ΛPt −Xi

ni(µ, Pt) αi − ∇(s, r) δ,

∇(s, r) = ∆(t, 2d) + ∆(d − 1 − t, 2d) + t/2,

where ∆(t, 2d) is as in (2.3). For any 2d-tuple of integers x = (x1, . . . , x2d), we deﬁne
as in §2.3.1

Then, we have

πx =

wt(µ, t) ≡ ΛPt −Xi

ni(µ, Pt) αcl

i mod Z δ,

≡ πs+r + 2Λ1 mod Z δ.

The eﬀect on the weight of removing a d-cohook is studied in the following lemma.

Lemma 6.15. Let t, t′ be integers and µ, µ′ be bipartitions. Set Θ = Θt(µ) and
Θ′ = Θt′(µ′).
If Θ′ is obtained from Θ by removing a d-cohook, then wt(µ, t) =
wt(µ′, t′) − δ/2.

67

Proof. By (2.4), we have

wt(µ, t) = wt(|µ1, ti2d) + wt(|µ2, d − 1 − ti2d) +(cid:0)∆(t, 2d) + ∆(d − 1 − t, 2d) − ∇(s, r)(cid:1) δ

= wt(|µ1, ti2d) + wt(|µ2, d − 1 − ti2d) − t δ/2

= πs+r + 2Λ1 −(cid:0)w2d(µ1) + w2d(µ2) + ∆(s, 1) + ∆(r, 1) + t/2(cid:1)δ.

where we used the formulas in §2.3.1. Therefore we must study the eﬀect of removing
a d-cohook on the integer

w2d(µ1) + w2d(µ2) + ∆(s, 1) + ∆(r, 1) + t/2.

Note that by Lemma 6.14, removing a d-cohook has no eﬀect on s + r.

First, assume that there is an integer x ∈ βt(µ1) such that x /∈ βd−1−t(µ2) and

write

βt′(µ′1) = βt(µ1) \ {x},

βd−1−t′(µ′2) = βd−1−t(µ2) ⊔ {x}.

Fix p ∈ {1, . . . , 2d} and z ∈ βsp(µ1,p) such that

x = p − 2d + 2dz.

Fix u0 such that z = zu0 where βsp(µ1,p) = {z1 > z2 > · · · }. We have

We also have

(z′

|µ′1,p| − |µ1,p| =Xu>1
= X1≤u<u0

= sp − z.
We deduce that we have

w2d(µ′1) = w2d(µ1) + sp − z.

A similar computation yields

w2d(µ2) = w2d(µ′2) + r′

p − z = w2d(µ′2) + rp + 1 − z.

We deduce that

w2d(µ′1) + w2d(µ′2) = w2d(µ1) + w2d(µ2) + sp − rp − 1.
Since we have removed the element x from βt(µ1), we have t′ = t − 1.

Next, for any integers v, e with e > 1, we have

e (cid:23) .

We deduce that

∆(s′, 1) − ∆(s, 1) = 1 − sp, ∆(r′, 1) − ∆(r, 1) = rp.

In particular, the value of

w2d(µ1) + w2d(µ2) + ∆(s, 1) + ∆(r, 1) + t/2

decreases by 1/2.

Now assume that there is an integer y ∈ βd−1−t(µ2) such that y − 2d /∈ βt(µ1) and

let us write

βt′(µ′1) = βt(µ1) ⊔ {y − 2d},

βd−1−t′(µ′2) = βd−1−t(µ2) \ {y}.

Fix p ∈ {1, . . . , 2d} and z ∈ βrp(µ2,p) such that

y = p − 2d + 2dz.

The same computation as above gives

w2d(µ′2) = w2d(µ2) + rp − z, w2d(µ1) = w2d(µ′1) + (sp + 1) − (z − 1),

from which we deduce that

w2d(µ′1) + w2d(µ′2) = w2d(µ1) + w2d(µ2) + rp − sp − 2.

Since t′ = t + 1, the value of

w2d(µ1) + w2d(µ2) + ∆(s, 1) + ∆(r, 1) + t/2

decreases by 1/2.

6.5.5. The g2d-representation on Uk in the unitary case. We now have all the tools
to extend the action of g′
2d to g2d on Uk. Recall that we assume that f is even, so
∼→ g′
2d
qk . Let g2d be the Kac-Moody algebra associated with the quiver I2d,

f = 2d. Hence I2d is a cyclic quiver of size 2d and we have an isomorphismeslf
i.e., we have bslf ≃ g2d, and set X2d = P2d ⊕ Zδ/2.

Let σ be the automorphism of the Lie algebra g2d given by the quiver automorphism

of I2d such that i 7→ −i. In particular, we have σ(α∨
Deﬁnition 6.16. We deﬁne the weight of a symbol by wt(Θt(µ)) = σt
where wt(µ, t) is as in (6.6).

i ) = α∨
−i.

∗(wt(µ, t)),

We can now prove the following.

Proposition 6.17. Let µ be a bipartition and t ∈ Z. Let Θ, Θ′ be symbols.
(a) wt(Θt(µ)) ≡ wt(|µ, Qti2d) mod Z δ,
(b) if Θ′ is obtained from Θ by removing a d-hook, then wt(Θ) = σ∗wt(Θ′) − δ/2,
(c) EΘ, EΘ′ belong to the same ℓ-block if and only if we have wt(Θ) = wt(Θ′).

Proof. We have Qt = (−1)tPt. Further,

wt(µ, t) ≡ ΛPt −Xi
wt(|µ, Qti2d) ≡ ΛQt −Xi

69

ni(µ, Pt) αcl

i mod Z δ,

ni(µ, Qt) αcl

i mod Z δ.

This implies part (a) because

n(−1)ti(µ, Pt) = ni(µ, (−1)tPt) = ni(µ, Qt).

Part (b) follows from Lemma 6.15.

Now, we prove part (c). Recall that the representations EΘ and EΘ′ are in the
same ℓ-block if and only if Θ and Θ′ have the same rank and the same d-cocore Θ◦,
see §6.3.4.

Assume that this is the case. Since the number of d-cohooks one needs to add to
Θ◦ to obtain Θ and Θ′ depends only on the rank of the symbols, we deduce from
Lemma 6.15 that Θ and Θ′ have the same weight.

Conversely, assume now that wt(Θ) = wt(Θ′). Then (6.7) implies that

(6.8)

πs+r = πs′+r′.

By deﬁnition of s, r, s′ and r′ we have

Xp

sp = t, Xp
rp = d − 1 − t, Xp
(sp + rp) =Xp
Xp

(s′

hence

(6.9)

p = t′, Xp

p = d − 1 − t′,

p + r′

p) = d − 1.

From (6.8) and (6.9), we deduce that the 2d-tuples s + r and s′ + r′ are equal. Hence,
by Lemma 6.14, the symbols Θ and Θ′ have the same d-cocore Θ◦. Let w and w′
be the number of d-cohooks we need to add to Θ◦ to obtain Θ and Θ′ respectively.
Since σ∗(δ) = δ, by part (b) we have

wt(Θ) = (σ∗)w wt(Θ◦) − w δ/2,
wt(Θ′) = (σ∗)w′
wt(Θ◦) − w′ δ/2.

Since σ∗(δ) = δ and wt(Θ) = wt(Θ′), we deduce that w = w′.
In particular,
the symbols Θ and Θ′ have the same rank, which shows that the corresponding
representations lie in the same ℓ-block.
(cid:3)

We have proved the following reﬁnement of Theorem 6.11.

module isomorphismLt∈N F(Qt)2d

Theorem 6.18. Recall that ℓ and q are odd, and ℓ ∤ q(q2 − 1). Assume that f
is even. The representation datum on Uk gives a g2d-representation yielding a g′
2d-
∼→ [Uk] such that |µ, Qti2d 7→ dU ([EΘt(µ)]). The
weights of the g2d-module [Uk] belong to the lattice X2d. The weight of dU ([EΘt(µ)])
is equal to wt(Θt(µ)). The classes in [Uk] of the simple unipotent modules are weight
vectors. Two simple unipotent modules belong to the same block if and only if their
classes have the same weight in X2d.
(cid:3)

6.5.6. Determination of the ramiﬁed Hecke algebras. As in the case of ﬁnite unitary
groups, see §4.7.2, we can invoke Proposition 1.5 to show that every ramiﬁed Hecke
algebra associated to a weakly cuspidal module is indeed a Hecke algebra, whose
parameters can be read oﬀ from the weight of the cuspidal module.

Corollary 6.19. Let D be a weakly cuspidal kGr-module. Then
(a) the weight of the class [D] with respect to the g′

2d-action on [Uk] is of the form

ΛQ for some element Q = (Q1, Q2) in I 2

2d,

(b) for each m > 0 and n = r +2m, the map φk,m : Hq2
∼−→ H (kGn, D).

to an algebra isomorphism HQ; q2

k,m

k,m −→ EndkGn(F m)op factors
(cid:3)

In order to apply this corollary eﬃciently, we must determine explicitly the weakly
cuspidal modules and their weights. In the linear prime case, this is known by [39]. In
the unitary prime case, by Theorem 6.18, the weakly cuspidal modules form a basis
of the subspace of highest weight vectors of the representation of g′
2d on [Uk], hence
all ramiﬁed Hecke algebras can be explicitly computed.
If, moreover, we assume
that the decomposition matrix is unitriangular with respect to the a-function, see
Conjecture 6.21 below, then the weakly cuspidal modules and their weights can also
be read oﬀ from the crystal isomorphism in Theorem 6.22 below.

More precisely, any weakly cuspidal module is of the form D = DΘ for some symbol
Θ = Θt(µ). The parameter Q can be explicitly computed from µ and t according to
the rule

wt(DΘ) ≡ ΛQt −Xi

≡ ΛQ1 + ΛQ2 mod Z δ.

ni(µ, Qt) αcl

i mod Z δ,

Since the isomorphism in Proposition 6.9 identiﬁes the set

{[DΘt(µ)] ; µ ∈ P 2, DΘt(µ) is weakly cuspidal}

with a basis of the space of highest weight vectors

{x ∈ F(Qt)2d ; Ei(x) = 0, ∀i = 1, 2, . . . , 2d},

71

the weakly cuspidal modules correspond precisely to the elements in the crystal

B(st)2d which are killed by the operators eE1, . . . ,eE2d, with the notation in §6.7.3

below. These elements have been computed recently in [43, thm. 5.9] in terms of
bipartitions µ whose abacus is totally 2d-periodic. N

6.6. Derived equivalences.

Blocks of Uk are parametrized by pairs (Θ, w) where Θ is a d-core (resp. a d-
cocore) when f is odd (resp. f is even) and w is a non-negative integer called the
degree of the block. The unipotent characters lying in BΘ,w are parametrized by the
symbols which are obtained from Θ by adding w successive d-hooks (resp. d-cohooks)
if f is odd (resp. f is even).

Our categoriﬁcation theorems (see Theorem 6.18 and 6.12) show that blocks of Uk
and Uk,t correspond to weight spaces for the action of the Kac-Moody algebra g2d.
Using the work of Chuang-Rouquier [10] (see also Theorem 1.11) we obtain derived
equivalences between blocks of Uk which are in the same orbit under the action of
the aﬃne Weyl group W2d.

If ℓ is a linear prime (i.e. f is odd), the situation is similar to the case of ﬁnite
unitary groups. The d-cores, which are formed by pairs of partitions which are both
d-cores, form a single orbit under the action of W2d. In particular, orbits of blocks
of Uk,t under W2d are parametrized by their degree. Let w ∈ N. Livesey showed
in [51, thm. 7.1] how to construct a good block of Uk,t of degree w which is derived
equivalent to its Brauer correspondent. We deduce that Brou´e’s abelian defect group
conjecture holds for groups of type BC at odd linear primes.

Theorem 6.20. Recall that ℓ and q are odd. Assume that the order f of q modulo
ℓ is even. Let B be a unipotent block of Gn over k or O, and D be a defect group
of B. If D is abelian, then B is derived equivalent to its Brauer correspondent in
NGn(D).
(cid:3)

6.7. The crystal of Uk.

As in the case of ﬁnite unitary groups, see §4.7, our goal is to compare the
crystal of the categorical representation on Uk with the crystal of the g2d-module

Lt F(Qt)2d. In order to get an explicit crystal isomorphism, we will assume that

the ℓ-decomposition matrices of unipotent blocks are unitriangular with respect to
the a-function. This gives a parametrization of the simple objects of Uk and a com-
binatorial way (yet conjectural) to compute the (weak) Harish-Chandra branching
graph.

72

O. DUDAS, M. VARAGNOLO, E. VASSEROT

Throughout this section we will assume that ℓ is a unitary prime, which means

that the order f of q modulo ℓ is even. We will write f = 2d.

6.7.1. Ordering symbols. For t > 0, we deﬁne the charge

(6.10)

st =(cid:26) (t, d − 1 − t)

(t − d, −1 − t)

if t is even,
if t is odd.

The symbol associated with a bipartition µ is Θ = Θt(µ) = {βt(µ1), β−1−t(µ2)}. As
in [33, §5.5.10], we can consider the union of the two β-sets βt(µ1) and β−1−t(µ2)
(allowing multiplicities) and write their elements in non-increasing order

κmt(µ) := (κ1 > κ2 > κ3 > · · · ),

where the parameter mt is given by

mt = (t, −1 − t).

We can check that κi = ⌊i/2⌋ for i large enough. Then, we deﬁne the a-value of the
symbol Θ by

a(Θt(µ)) = a(Θ) :=

(i − 1)(cid:18)κi −(cid:22) i

2(cid:23)(cid:19) .

∞Xi=1

This diﬀers slightly from the a-value a(mt,1)(µ) deﬁned in [33] : from [33, prop. 5.5.11]
we have a(Θt(µ)) = a(mt,1)(µ) + a(Θt(∅)).

On the set of symbols in the same Harish-Chandra series and of the same rank we

deﬁne as in [33, §5.7.5] a partial order by

Θt(µ) 4 Θt(λ) ⇐⇒ µ ≪mt λ ⇐⇒ λ = µ or κmt(λ) < κmt(µ).

We deduce from [33, prop. 5.7.7] that

(6.11)

Θt(µ) ≺ Θt(λ) =⇒ a(Θt(µ)) < a(Θt(λ)).

6.7.2. Parametrization of unipotent modules. By Proposition 3.4 we know that when
ℓ is odd, there are as many unipotent kGn-modules as symbols of odd defect and rank
n. However there is no known natural parametrization of these modules in terms
of symbols unless the decomposition matrix has unitriangular shape. This property
has been proved when f is odd [39], i.e., when ℓ is a linear prime, or when f and n
are small. Geck conjectured in [30, conj. 3.4] that it should always hold.

Conjecture 6.21 (Geck). Assume ℓ is odd. There exists a parametrization

Irr(Uk) = {[DΘ] | λ ∈ Sodd}

of the simple unipotent modules and an ordering 6 on symbols such that the decom-
position map satisﬁes the following unitriangularity property

73

dU ([EΘ]) ∈ [DΘ] + XΘ′<Θ

Z[DΘ′].

Moreover, the ordering 6 can be chosen to be compatible with the a-function so that
Θ′ 6 Θ implies a(Θ′) 6 a(Θ).

This conjecture is expected to hold for any ﬁnite reductive group as long as ℓ is
a very good prime. In that case the ordering 6 should be induced from the partial
order on families of unipotent characters deﬁned by Lusztig.

6.7.3. Comparison of the crystals. Recall that to any categorical representation one
can associate a perfect basis, and hence an abstract crystal, see Proposition 1.9.
In §6.5.1 we constructed a categorical representation of g′
2d on the category Uk of
unipotent representations over k. From this categorical representation we get an

abstract crystal B(Uk) =(cid:0)Irr(Uk),eEi,eFi(cid:1). As for ﬁnite unitary groups, this crystal is

related to the (weak) Harish-Chandra series. More precisely, the (uncolored) crystal
graph associated with B(Uk) coincides with the weak Harish-Chandra branching
graph, and its connected components with the weak Harish-Chandra series. See
§4.7.1 for more details.

Recall from Theorem 6.11 that [Uk] is isomorphic to a direct sum of Fock spaces
F(Qt)2d where t runs over N and Qt = (Q1, Q2) = ((−q)t, (−q)−1−t). Recall from
(6.10) that we have deﬁned the charge st = (s1, s2) by

st =((t, d − 1 − t)

(t − d, −1 − t)

if t is even,
if t is odd

and mt = (t, −1 − t). Since qd = −1 in k, we have Qp = q2sp for each p = 1, 2.
In other words st is a charge for F(Qt)2d with respect to q. Let B(st)2d be the
corresponding abstract crystal of F(Qt)2d, with the canonical labeling B(st)2d =

Under the assumption that the decomposition matrix is unitriangular with respect
to the a-function, we can compare the crystal B2d with the abstract crystal B(Uk)

{b(µ, st) | µ ∈ P 2, t ∈ N}. Finally, we set B2d =F t∈N B(st)2d.
coming from the categorical action of bsl2d on Uk.

Theorem 6.22. Recall that ℓ, q are odd and f is even. If Conjecture 6.21 holds,
then the map b(µ, st) 7→ [DΘt(µ)] is a crystal isomorphism B2d

∼→ B(Uk).

74

O. DUDAS, M. VARAGNOLO, E. VASSEROT

Proof. Let t ∈ Z and µ be a bipartition. By [33, thm. 6.6.12] the Uglov basis satisﬁes

b(µ, st) ∈ |µ, sti + Xλ6=µ

λ≪mt µ

Z|λ, sti.

Let φ : |µ, sti 7→ dU ([EΘt(µ)]) be the morphism of g′
the previous formula and the deﬁnition of 4 we have

2d-modules studied in §6.5.1. By

φ(b(µ, st)) ∈ dU ([EΘt(µ)]) + XΘ′6=Θt(µ)

Θ′4Θt(µ)

ZdU ([EΘ′]).

Let n be the rank of the symbol Θt(µ). If Conjecture 6.21 holds, then we can choose
a total order 6 on symbols of rank n and odd defect, compatible with the a-function
and for which the decomposition map dU is unitriangular. In particular, using (6.11)
we have

Θ′ 6= Θt(µ) and Θ′ 4 Θt(µ) =⇒ a(Θ′) < a(Θt(µ)) =⇒ Θ′ 6 Θt(µ).

This, together with the previous formula shows that

φ(b(µ, st)) ∈ [DΘt(µ)] + XΘ′6=Θt(µ)

Θ′6Θt(µ)

Z[DΘ′]

and we can invoke Proposition 1.10 to conclude.

(cid:3)

Remark 6.23. Note that the deﬁnition of st makes sense for negative integers t as
well. Then b(µ, st) 7−→ b(µ†, s−1−t) induces an isomorphism of crystals. This is a
particular case of changing the charge (a, b) to (b − d, a + d).
