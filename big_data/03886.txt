Abstract. Comparison between multidimensional persistent Betti num-
bers is often based on the multidimensional matching distance. While this
metric is rather simple to deﬁne and compute by considering a suitable
family of ﬁltering functions associated with lines having a positive slope,
it has two main drawbacks. First, it forgets the natural link between
the homological properties of ﬁltrations associated with lines that are
close to each other. As a consequence, part of the interesting homolog-
ical information is lost. Second, its intrinsically discontinuous deﬁnition
makes it diﬃcult to study its properties. In this paper we introduce a
new matching distance for 2D persistent Betti numbers, called coherent
matching distance and based on matchings that change coherently with
the ﬁltrations we take into account. Its deﬁnition is not trivial, as it must
face the presence of monodromy in multidimensional persistence, i.e. the
fact that diﬀerent paths in the space parameterizing the above ﬁltra-
tions can induce diﬀerent matchings between the associated persistent
diagrams. In our paper we prove that the coherent 2D matching distance
is well-deﬁned and stable.

based on the idea that the most important properties of a ﬁltered topological
space are the ones that persist under large changes of the parameters deﬁning the
sublevel sets in the ﬁltration. The concept of persistence revealed quite useful in
extracting information from data that can be described by Rh-valued functions
deﬁned on a topological space (e.g., images or point clouds representing 3D-
models, via a distance function).

The theory of topological persistence was initially developed for the case
h = 1, but in recent years the interest in the case h > 1 has rapidly in-
creased, leading to new theoretical developments and computational methods
(cf., e.g., [1,4,5,12]). One of this methods is based on a reduction of the h-
dimensional case to the 1-dimensional setting by using a suitable family of
derived real-valued functions [2,3,6]. If h = 2, it consists of changing the 2D
ﬁltration given by a ﬁltering function f = (f1, f2) : M → R2 into the 1D
ﬁltrations associated with the real-valued functions f ∗
a,b : M → R deﬁned as

f ∗

a,b(x) := min{a, 1 − a} · maxn f1(x)−b

a

, f2(x)+b

1−a o, for a ∈]0, 1[ and b ∈ R. This

approach allows for introducing a distance Dmatch(βf , βg) between the persis-
tent Betti numbers associated with f and g, which is deﬁned as the supremum
of the classical bottleneck distance between the persistent diagrams of f ∗
a,b and
g∗
a,b, varying a and b.

While this method brings back the problem to the 1D case, it opens the way
to new issues of interest. First of all, the distance Dmatch forgets the natural link
between the homological properties of ﬁltrations associated with pairs (a, b) that
are close to each other. This fact implies that part of the homological information
is lost. Second, its intrinsically discontinuous deﬁnition makes it diﬃcult to study
its properties.

As a possible answer to these observations, we introduce in this paper a new
matching distance for 2D persistent Betti numbers, called coherent matching
distance and based on the use of matchings that change continuously with respect
to the ﬁltrations we take into account. In order to state its deﬁnition, we have to
manage the problem of monodromy, consisting of the fact that a loop in the space
parameterizing the above ﬁltrations can induce a transformation that changes a
matching σ between the associated persistent diagrams into a matching τ 6= σ [7].
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 1, we recall the deﬁnitions of
multidimensional persistent Betti number and multidimensional matching dis-
tance, together with the monodromy phenomenon in 2D persistent homology. In
Section 2, we introduce the coherent 2D matching distance and prove that it is
well-deﬁned and stable.

Let f = (f1, f2) be a continuous map from a ﬁnitely triangulable topological
space M to the real plane R2.

1.1 Persistent Betti numbers

As a reference for multidimensional persistent Betti numbers we use [6]. Accord-
ing to the main topic of this paper, we will also stick to the notations and working
assumptions adopted in [7]. In particular, we build on the strategy adopted in
the latter to study certain instances of monodromy for multidimensional persis-
tent Betti numbers. Roughly, the idea is to reduce the problem to the analysis of
a collection of persistent Betti numbers associated with a real-valued function,
and their compact representation in terms of persistence diagrams.

We use the following notations: ∆+ is the open set {(u, v) ∈ R × R : u < v}.
∆ represents the diagonal set {(u, v) ∈ R × R : u = v}. We can further extend
∆+ with points at inﬁnity of the kind (u, ∞), where |u| < ∞. Denote this set
∆∗. For a continuous function ϕ : M → R, and for any n ∈ N, if u < v,
the inclusion map of the sublevel set Mu = {x ∈ M : ϕ(x) ≤ u} into the
sublevel set Mv = {x ∈ M : ϕ(x) ≤ v} induces a homomorphism from the nth
homology group of Mu into the nth homology group of Mv. The image of this
homomorphism is called the nth persistent homology group of (M, ϕ) at (u, v),
and is denoted by H (u,v)
(M, ϕ) contains
all and only the homology classes of n-cycles born before or at u and still alive
at v.

(M, ϕ). In other words, the group H (u,v)

Following [6], we assume the use of ˇCech homology, and refer the reader to
that paper for a detailed explanation about preferring this homology theory to
others. Also, we work with coeﬃcients in a ﬁeld K, so that homology groups are
vector spaces. Therefore, they can be completely described by their dimension,
leading to the following deﬁnition [10].

n

n

Deﬁnition 1 (Persistent Betti Numbers). The persistent Betti numbers
function of ϕ, brieﬂy PBN, is the function βϕ : ∆+ → N ∪ {∞} deﬁned by

βϕ(u, v) = dim H (u,v)

n

(M, ϕ).

Under the above assumptions for M , it is possible to show that βϕ is ﬁnite for all
(u, v) ∈ ∆+ [6]. Obviously, for each n ∈ Z, we have diﬀerent PBNs of ϕ (which
might be denoted by βϕ,n, say), but for the sake of notational simplicity we omit
adding any reference to n.

The PBNs of ϕ can be simply and compactly described by the corresponding
persistence diagrams. Formally, a persistence diagram can be deﬁned via the no-
tion of multiplicity [8,11]. Following the convention used for PBNs, any reference
to n will be dropped in the sequel.
Deﬁnition 2 (Multiplicity). The multiplicity µϕ(u, v) of (u, v) ∈ ∆+ is the
ﬁnite, non-negative number given by

βϕ(u + ε, v − ε) − βϕ(u − ε, v − ε) − βϕ(u + ε, v + ε) + βϕ(u − ε, v + ε).

min
ε>0

u+ε<v−ε

The multiplicity µϕ(u, ∞) of (u, ∞) is the ﬁnite, non-negative number given by

min

ε>0, u+ε<v

βϕ(u + ε, v) − βϕ(u − ε, v).

4

Deﬁnition 3 (Persistence Diagram). The persistence diagram Dgm(ϕ) is
the multiset of all points (u, v) ∈ ∆∗ such that µϕ(u, v) > 0, counted with their
multiplicity, union the points of ∆, counted with inﬁnite multiplicity.

Each point (u, v) ∈ ∆∗ with positive multiplicity will be called a cornerpoint. A
cornerpoint (u, v) will be said to be a proper cornerpoint if (u, v) ∈ ∆+, and a
cornerpoint at inﬁnity if (u, v) ∈ ∆∗ \ ∆+.

1.2 2-dimensional setting
The deﬁnition of persistent Betti numbers can be easily extended to Rh-valued
functions [6]. It has been proved that, in this case, the information enclosed in the
persistent Betti numbers is equivalent to that represented by the set of persistent
Betti numbers associated with a certain family of real-valued functions. We
discuss this for the speciﬁc case of the above function f : M → R2, referring the
reader to Figure 1 for a pictorial representation.

Fig. 1. Correspondence between an admissible line ra,b and the persistence diagram
Dgm(f ∗

a,b)

Consider the pairs (a, b) ∈ ]0, 1[ ×R. Any such pair identiﬁes an oriented line
ra,b ∈ R2 of positive slope, parameterized by t with equation (u, v) = t · (a, 1 −
a) + (b, −b). The space Λ of lines obtained according to this procedure is referred
to as the set of admissible lines, whereas P (Λ) denotes the set of pairs (a, b)
parameterizing Λ. The generic point (u, v) = t · (a, 1 − a) + (b, −b) of ra,b can be
associated with the sublevel set of M deﬁned as {x ∈ M : f1(x) ≤ u, f2(x) ≤ v},
which is equivalent to that given by {x ∈ M : fa,b(x) ≤ t} induced by the

real-valued function fa,b : M → R with fa,b(x) := maxn f1(x)−b

this setting, the Reduction Theorem proved in [6] states that the persistent
Betti numbers βf can be completely recovered by considering all and only the
persistent Betti numbers βfa,b associated with the admissible lines ra,b, which
are in turn encoded in the corresponding persistence diagrams Dgm(fa,b).

2-dimensional matching distance Assume now that we have two continu-
ous functions f, g : M → R2. We consider the persistence diagrams Dgm(fa,b),
Dgm(ga,b) associated with the admissible line ra,b, and normalize them by multi-
plying their points by min{a, 1−a}. This is equivalent to consider the normalized
persistence diagrams Dgm(f ∗
a,b = min{a, 1 − a} · fa,b and
g∗
a,b = min{a, 1 − a} · ga,b, respectively. The 2-dimensional matching distance
Dmatch(βf , βg) [2] is then deﬁned as

a,b), Dgm(g∗

a,b), with f ∗

Dmatch(βf , βg) = sup
P (Λ)

dB(Dgm(f ∗

with dB(Dgm(f ∗
the normalized persistence diagrams Dgm(f ∗

a,b), Dgm(g∗

a,b)) denoting the usual bottleneck distance between

a,b) and Dgm(g∗

a,b) [8,9].

Remark 1. The introduction of normalized persistence diagrams is crucial here.
Indeed, the bottleneck distance dB(Dgm(f ∗
a,b)) is stable against func-
tions’ perturbations when measured by the sup-norm, while this is not true for
the distance dB(Dgm(fa,b), Dgm(ga,b)), see [6, Thm. 4.2] for details.

a,b), Dgm(g∗

Monodromy in 2-dimensional persistent homology We know that nor-
malized persistence diagrams are stable with respect to changes of the underly-
ing functions, when the sup-norm is considered (Remark 1). Since each function
f ∗
a,b depends continuously on the parameters a and b with respect to the sup-
norm, it follows that the set of points in Dgm(f ∗
a,b) depends continuously on the
parameters a and b. Analogously, the set of points in Dgm(g∗
a,b) depends contin-
uously on the parameters a and b. Suppose that σa,b : Dgm(f ∗
a,b)
is an optimal matching, i.e. one of the matchings achieving the bottleneck dis-
tance dB(Dgm(f ∗
a,b)). Given the above arguments, a natural question
arises, whether σa,b changes continuously varying a and b. In other words, we
wonder if it is possible to straighforwardly introduce a notion of coherence for
optimal matchings with respect to the elements of P (Λ).

a,b) → Dgm(g∗

a,b), Dgm(g∗

Perhaps surprisingly, the answer is no. A ﬁrst obstruction is given by the
fact that, trying to continuously extend a matching σa,b, the identity of points
in the (normalized) persistent diagrams is not preserved when considering an
admissible pair (¯a, ¯b) for which either Dgm(f ∗
¯a,¯b) has points with
multiplicity greater than 1. In other words, we cannot follow the path of a
cornerpoint when it collides with another cornerpoint. On the one hand, this
problem can be solved by replacing P (Λ) with its subset Reg(f ) ∩ Reg(g), with

¯a,¯b) or Dgm(g∗

Reg(f ) = {(a, b) ∈ P (Λ)|Dgm(f ∗
Reg(g) = {(a, b) ∈ P (Λ)|Dgm(g∗

a,b) does not contain multiple points},
a,b) does not contain multiple points}.

Throughout the rest of the paper, we will talk about singular pairs for f to
denote the pairs (a, b) ∈ P (Λ) \ Reg(f ), and about regular pairs for f to denote
the pairs (a, b) ∈ Reg(f ). An analogous convention holds referring to the singular
and regular pairs for g.

6

A. Cerri, M. Ethier and P. Frosini

On the other hand, however, continuously extending a matching σa,b presents
some problems even in this setting. Roughly, the process of extending σa,b along
a path c : [0, 1] → Reg(f ) ∩ Reg(g) depends on the homotopy class of c relative
to its endpoints. This phenomenon is referred to as monodromy in 2-dimensional
persistent homology, and has been studied for the ﬁrst time in [7]. In what follows
we will show how to overcome this issue in order to deﬁne a coherent modiﬁcation
of the standard 2-dimensional matching distance Dmatch.

1.3 Working assumptions

To simplify the exposition, in what follows we state our results by assuming that
M is homeomorphic to Sm, with m ≥ 2. In particular, this implies that all nor-
malized persistence diagrams Dgm(f ∗
a,b) contain a single cornerpoint
at inﬁnity in degree 0 and n, and no cornerpoint at inﬁnity in the other homology
degrees. In this way, the problem of continuously extending a matching can be
restricted to considering only proper cornerpoints, as there are no ambiguities
in following the evolution of cornerpoints at inﬁnity. Also, we assume that

a,b), Dgm(g∗

1. the functions f, g : M → R2 are normal, i.e. the sets of singular pairs for f

and g are discrete [7];

2. a constant real value k > 0 exists such that if two proper cornerpoints
X1, X2 of Dgm∗(fa,b) have Euclidean distance less than k from ∆, then
the Euclidean distance between X1 and X2 is not smaller than k, for all
(a, b) ∈ P (Λ). The same property holds for Dgm∗(ga,b).

2 The coherent 2-dimensional matching distance

a,b) corresponds to which point in Dgm(f ∗

The existence of monodromy implies that each loop in Reg(f ) induces a permu-
tation on Dgm(f ∗
a,b). In other words, it is not possible to establish which point
in Dgm(f ∗
a′,b′) for (a, b) 6= (a′, b′), since
the answer depends on the path that is considered from (a, b) to (a′, b′) in the
parameter space Reg(f ). As a consequence, diﬀerent paths going from (a, b) to
(a′, b′) might produce diﬀerent results while extending a matching σa,b. However,
it is still possible to deﬁne a notion of coherent 2-dimensional matching distance.

2.1 Transporting a matching along a path

First, we need to specify the concept of transporting a proper cornerpoint X ∈
Dgm(ϕ) along a homotopy h(τ, x) := (1 − τ ) · ϕ(x) + τ · ψ(x), with ϕ, ψ : M → R.

Deﬁnition 4 (Admissible path). Let p ∈ [0, 1]. A continuous path P : [0, p] →
∆+ ∪ ∆ is said to be admissible for h at ¯p ∈ [0, p] if the following hold:

1. P (τ ) ∈ Dgm(h(τ, ·)) for τ ∈ [0, p];
2. P ([0, p]) ∩ ∆ is ﬁnite;

The coherent matching distance in 2D persistent homology

7

3. if P (¯p) ∈ ∆ then there is no p′ ∈]¯p, p] such that P ([¯p, p′]) = {P (¯p)} and a
continuous path Q : [¯p, p′] → ∆+ ∪ ∆ exists for which Q(τ ) ∈ Dgm(h(τ, ·))
for τ ∈ [¯p, p′], Q(¯p) = P (¯p) and Q([¯p, p′]) 6= {P (¯p)}.

P is called admissible for h if it is admissible for h at every point of its domain.

In other words, P is not admissible for a homotopy h if it “stops” at a point
P (¯p) ∈ ∆ while it could “move on” in ∆+. The set of all paths P : [0, p] → ∆+∪∆
admissible for h is endowed with a partial order. For two paths P1 : [0, p1] →
∆+ ∪ ∆, P2 : [0, p2] → ∆+ ∪ ∆ admissible for h, we say that P1 (cid:22) P2 if p1 ≤ p2
and P1(τ ) = P2(τ ) for every τ ∈ [0, p1].

In what follows, we focus on paths that are admissible for the homotopy
c(τ ) by a continuous path c : [0, 1] → Reg(f ). With a

induced on the function f ∗
slight abuse of notation, we talk about paths admissible for c.

Proposition 1. Let c : [0, 1] → Reg(f ) be a continuous path with c(0) = (a, b).
a,b), a unique path P : [0, 1] → ∆+ ∪ ∆
For every proper cornerpoint X ∈ Dgm(f ∗
admissible for c exists, such that P (0) = X.

Proof. For every real number α ≥ 0, consider the property

(∗) a path Pα : [0, α] → ∆+ ∪ ∆ admissible for c exists, with Pα(0) = X.

Deﬁne the set A = {α ∈ [0, 1] : property (∗) holds}. A is non-empty, since
0 ∈ A. Set ¯α = sup A. We need to show that ¯α ∈ A. First, let (αn) be a non-
decreasing sequence of numbers of A converging to ¯α. Since αn ∈ A, for each n
there is a path Pn : [0, αn] → ∆+ ∪ ∆ admissible for c with Pn(0) = X. By the
Hausdorﬀ maximal principle, we can consider a maximal chain of paths Pn and
deﬁne a function P ′
¯α(τ ) = Pn(τ ) for any Pn in
the maximal chain whose domain contains τ .

¯α : [0, ¯α) → ∆+ ∪ ∆ by setting P ′

¯α is such that P ′

¯α(0) = X and P ′

¯α(τ ) ∈ Dgm(f ∗

In particular, the function P ′

c(τ ))
for all τ ∈ [0, ¯α). However, to prove that ¯α ∈ A we still need to show that P ′
¯α
can be continuously extended to the point ¯α. The localization of cornerpoints [6,
Prop. 3.8] implies that, possibly by extracting a convergent subsequence, we can
assume that the limit limn Pn(αn) = limn P ′
¯α(αn) exists. By the 1-dimensional
Stability Theorem [6, Thm. 3.13], we have that limn P ′
c( ¯α)). Now,
¯α can be extended to a path P ¯α : [0, ¯α] → ∆+ ∪ ∆ by setting
the function P ′
P ¯α(¯α) = limn P ′
¯α(αn). It is easy to check that P ¯α is admissible for c, and hence
¯α ∈ A.

¯α(αn) ∈ Dgm(f ∗

Last, we prove by contradiction that ¯α = 1. Suppose that ¯α < 1. If P ¯α(¯α) 6∈
∆, again by the 1-dimensional Stability Theorem and the fact that c(¯α) ∈
Reg(f ), for any suﬃciently small ε > 0 we could take a real number η > 0
such that there is exactly one proper cornerpoint X ′(τ ) ∈ Dgm(f ∗
c(τ )) with
d(X ′(τ ), P ¯α(¯α)) ≤ ε for every τ with ¯α ≤ τ ≤ ¯α + η. By setting P ¯α(τ ) = X ′(τ )
for every such τ , we would get a continuous path that extends P ¯α to the interval
[0, ¯α + η). We could work similarly also in case P ¯α(¯α) ∈ ∆. Indeed, our working
assumption (2., Section 1.3) implies that arbitrarily close to P ¯α(¯α) we could ﬁnd

8

A. Cerri, M. Ethier and P. Frosini

at most one proper cornerpoint X ′(τ ), for all τ with ¯α ≤ τ ≤ ¯α + η and η suﬃ-
ciently small, to be used to extend P ¯α. If there is no such a proper cornerpoint,
P ¯α could be extended by setting P ¯α(τ ) = P ¯α(¯α) for the same values of τ . In any
case, we would get a contradiction of our assumption that ¯α = sup A.

We now show that there is a unique path P : [0, 1] → ∆+ ∪ ∆ that is
admissible for c and starts at X. Assume that another path P ′ : [0, 1] → ∆+ ∪ ∆
admissible for c exists, with X = P (0) = P ′(0). Denote by ¯τ the greatest value
for which P (τ ) = P ′(τ ) for all τ ∈ [0, ¯τ ]. Since P diﬀers from P ′, ¯τ < 1. By the
1-dimensional Stability Theorem, if P (¯τ ) 6∈ ∆ then P (¯τ ) is a proper cornerpoint
of Dgm(f ∗
c(¯τ )) with multiplicity strictly greater than 1, against our assumption
that c(τ ) ∈ Reg(f ) for all τ ∈ [0, 1]. If P (¯τ ) ∈ ∆ then P and P ′ contradict
the deﬁnition of admissible path for c, because of our working assumption (2.,
Section 1.3). Therefore, the path P must be unique.

We say that c transports X to X ′ = P (1) with respect to f . Now, we need to
deﬁne the concept of transporting a matching along a path c : [0, 1] → Reg(f ) ∩
Reg(g) with c(0) = (a, b). Suppose that σ(a,b)(X) = Y . Let σa,b be a matching
between Dgm(f ∗
a,b), with (a, b) an element of Reg(f ) ∩ Reg(g).
We can naturally associate to σa,b a matching σc(1) : Dgm(f ∗
c(1)).
We set σc(1)(X ′) = Y ′ if and only if c transports X to X ′ with respect to f and
Y to Y ′ with respect to g. We also say that c transports σa,b to σc(1) along c
with respect to the pair (f, g).

a,b) and Dgm(g∗

c(1)) → Dgm(g∗

Following the same line of proof of Proposition 1, we can also prove the

following result.

Proposition 2. Let G(s, x) := (1 − s) · ϕ(x) + s · ψ(x) be a homotopy between
ϕ, ψ : M → R. Then, for every X ∈ Dgm(ϕ) of multiplicity 1 and every suﬃ-
ciently small ε > 0, a unique path P : [0, ε] → ∆+ ∪∆ exists, such that P (0) = X
and P is admissible for G at any τ ∈ [0, ε].

We say that G transports X to X ′.

We are now ready to introduce the coherent 2-dimensional matching distance.

Deﬁnition 5. Choose a point (a, b) ∈ Reg(f ) ∩ Reg(g). Let Γ be the set of all
continuous paths c : [0, 1] → Reg(f ) ∩ Reg(g) with c(0) = (a, b). Let S be the set
of all matchings σ : Dgm(f ∗
c(0)). For every σ ∈ S and every c ∈ Γ ,
the symbol T (f,g)
(σ) will denote the matching obtained by transporting σ along
c with respect to the pair (f, g). We deﬁne the coherent 2-dimensional matching
distance CDmatch(βf , βg) as

Proof. First of all we recall that for every (a, b) ∈ P (Λ) and every x ∈ M , we
have

|f ∗

a,b(x) − g∗

a,b(x)| = min{a, 1 − a} · |fa,b(x) − ga,b(x)| ≤

min{a, 1 − a} · maxn(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

in other words, ||f ∗
a,b||∞ ≤ kf − gk∞. Let us consider the closed set C
obtained from P (Λ) by taking away a union of small balls of radius δ around
the singular pairs for f . Let ε be the inﬁmum for (a, b) ∈ C of the minimum
distance between any two proper cornerpoints of Dgm(f ∗
a,b). Note that, setting
K = maxx∈M {kf (p)k∞, kg(p)k∞}, the computation of ε can be accomplished
on the compact set C ′ = {(a, b) ∈ C : |b| ≤ K}. Indeed, for all (a, b) ∈ C with
|b| > K, we have that either Dgm(f ∗
a,b) = Dgm(f ∗
2 )
(analogously for g). Hence, by recalling our working assumption (2., Section 1.3)
and by construction of C ′, we have that ε > 0.

a,b) = Dgm(f ∗

Let ε′ be the inﬁmum for (a, b) ∈ C of the minimum distance between any
two points of Dgm(g∗
a,b||∞ ≤ kf − gk∞, we know
that when we change f according to the homotopy Gs := (1 − s) · f + s · g, each

point in the normalized persistence diagram moves by a distance not greater than
kf − Gsk∞ ≤ kf − gk∞, because of the stability of 2-dimensional persistent Betti
numbers under the multidimensional matching distance [6, Thm. 4.2]. Hence we
have that ε′ ≥ ε − 2kf − Gsk∞ ≥ ε − 2kf − gk∞. Therefore, if kf − gk∞ is small
enough, we have that ε > 0 implies ε′ > 0.

As a consequence, if kf −gk∞ is small enough, for each (a, b) ∈ C we can con-

a,b (see

a,b − g∗

We have that cost(σa,b) ≤ kf ∗

a,bk∞ ≤ kf − gk∞. If ˆc is a continuous
path from (¯a, ¯b) to (a, b) with ˆc([0, 1]) ⊂ C, it is easy to see that the function
σˆc(t) in the variable t describes the transport of σ¯a,¯b to σa,b made by ˆc with
respect to the pair (f, g), because σˆc(t) depends continuously on t.

Now, let c be a continuous path from (¯a, ¯b) to (a, b) with c([0, 1]) ⊂ Reg(f ) ∩
Reg(g). The image of c may be not contained in C, but if (¯a, ¯b), (a, b) ∈ C, c
is relative homotopic to a path ˆc : [0, 1] → C from (¯a, ¯b) to (a, b). This path ˆc
transports σ¯a,¯b to σa,b, too.

kf − gk∞. From this and from the fact that we can choose an arbitrarily small

ˆc

(σ¯a,¯b)(cid:17) = cost(cid:16)T (f,g)

(σ¯a,¯b)(cid:17) = cost (σa,b) ≤
(σ¯a,¯b)(cid:17) ≤ kf − gk∞ for every c ∈ Γ .

Hence we have that cost(cid:16)T (f,g)

δ, it follows that minσ∈S supc∈Γ cost(cid:16)T (f,g)

We conclude by observing that the deﬁnition of the coherent 2-dimensional
matching distance immediately implies that it is not less informative than the
usual 2-dimensional matching distance. Formally,

Proposition 5. Dmatch(βf , βg) ≤ CDmatch(βf , βg).

Conclusions

In this contribution we have introduced the notion of coherent 2-dimensional
matching distance. Similarly to the classical 2-dimensional matching distance, it
is based on deﬁning a suitable family of ﬁltrations associated with lines having a
positive slope; however, this new distance only considers matchings that change
coherently with respect to the ﬁltrations which are taken into account.

Through the paper we formally proved that the coherent matching distance
distance between 2-dimensional Persistent Betti numbers is well-deﬁned, sta-
ble and does not loose discriminative information with respect to the usual
2-dimensional matching distance. We believe that these ﬁrst results make the
coherent matching distance deserving further investigation, such as extending
the study of its theoretical properties as well as exploring how to develop com-
putational techniques for its practical evaluation.
