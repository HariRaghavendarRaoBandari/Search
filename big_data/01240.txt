ON MINIMIZERS OF AN ISOPERIMETRIC PROBLEM WITH

LONG-RANGE INTERACTIONS AND CONVEXITY CONSTRAINT

MICHAEL GOLDMAN, MATTEO NOVAGA, AND BERARDO RUFFINI

Abstract. We study a variational problem modeling the behavior at equilibrium of
charged liquid drops under convexity constraint. After proving well-posedness of the
model, we show C 1,1-regularity of minimizers for the Coulombic interaction in dimension
two. As a by-product we obtain that balls are the unique minimizers for small charge.
Eventually, we study the asymptotic behavior of minimizers, as the charge goes to inﬁnity.

1. Introduction

following problem:

In this paper we are interested in the existence and regularity of minimizers of the

min(cid:8)FQ,α(E) : E ⊂ RN convex body, |E| = V(cid:9) .

(1.1)

(1.3)

(1.4)

where, for E ⊂ RN , V, Q > 0 and α ∈ [0, N ), we have set

(1.2)
Here P (E) := HN−1(∂E) stands for the perimeter of E and, letting P(E) be the set of
probability measures supported on the closure of E, we set for α ∈ (0, N ),

FQ,α(E) := P (E) + Q2Iα(E).

(cid:90)

and for α = 0,

I0(E) := inf

Notice that, up to rescaling, we can assume, as we shall do for the rest of the paper, that
V = 1.

Starting from the seminal work of Lord Rayleigh [25] (in the Coulombic case N = 3,
α = 1), the functional (1.2) has been extensively studied in the physical literature to model
the shape of charged liquid drops (see [11] and the references therein). In particular, it is
known that the ball is a linearly stable critical point for (1.1) if the charge Q is not too
large (see for instance [7]). However, quite surprisingly, the authors showed in [11] that,
without the convexity constraint, (1.2) never admits minimizers under volume constraint
for any Q > 0 and α < N − 1. In particular, this implies that in this model a charged drop
is always nonlinearly unstable. This result is in sharp contrast with experiments (see for
instance [29, 27]), where there is evidence of stability of the ball for small charges. This
suggests that the energy FQ,α(E) does not include all the physically relevant contributions.
As shown in [11], a possible way to gain well-posedness of the problem is requiring
some extra regularity of the admissible sets. In this paper, we consider an alternative type

1

of constraint, namely the convexity of admissible sets. This assumption seems reasonable
as long as the minimizers remain strictly convex, that is for small enough charges. Let
us point out that in [23], still another regularizing mechanism is proposed. There, well-
posedness is obtained by adding an entropic term which prevents charges to concentrate
too much on the boundary of E.

Using the good compactness properties of convex sets, our ﬁrst result is the existence

of minimizers for every charge Q > 0.
Theorem 1.1. For every α ∈ [0, N ) and every Q, (1.1) admits a minimizer.

We then study the regularity of minimizers. As often in variational problems with
convexity constraints, regularity (or singularity) of minimizers is hard to deal with in
dimension larger than two (see [18, 19]). We thus restrict ourselves to N = 2. Since our
analysis strongly uses the regularity of equilibrium measures (i.e. the minimizer of (1.3)),
we are further reduced to study the case α = N − 2 (that is α = 0 in this case). The
second main result of the paper is then

Theorem 1.2. Let N = 2 and α = 0, then for every Q > 0, the minimizers of (1.1) are
of class C1,1.

Since we are able to prove uniform C1,1 estimates as Q goes to zero, building upon

our previous stability results established in [11], we get

Corollary 1.3. If N = 2 and α = 0, for Q small enough, the only minimizers of (1.1)
are balls.

The proof of Theorem 1.2 is based on the natural idea of comparing the minimizers
with a competitor made by “cutting out the angles”. However, the non-local nature of
the problem makes the estimates non-trivial. As already mentioned, a crucial point is an
estimate on the integrability of the equilibrium measures. This is obtained by drawing a
connection with harmonic measures (see Section 3). Let us point out1 that, up to proving
the regularity of the shape functional I0 and computing its shape derivative, one could
have obtained a proof of Theorem 1.2 by applying the abstract regularity result of [18].
Nevertheless, since our proof has a nice geometrical ﬂavor and since regularity of I0 is not
known in dimension two (in higher dimension, one can exploit the connection with the
capacity to prove it [13, 4]), we decided to keep it as it is.
We remark that, diﬀerently from the two-dimensional case, when N = 3 we expect the
onset of singularities at a critical value Qc > 0, with the shape of a spherical cone with
a prescribed angle. Such singularities are also observed in experiments and are usually
called Taylor cones (see [27, 29]). At the moment we are not able to show the presence of
such singularities in our model, and this will be the subject of future research.

Eventually, in Section 6, we study the behavior of the optimal sets when the charge
goes to inﬁnity. Even though this regime is less signiﬁcant from the point of view
of the applications, we believe that it is still mathematically interesting. Building on
Γ−convergence results, we prove

2. Existence of minimizers

In this section we show that the minimum in (1.1) is achieved. We begin with a simple

lemma linking estimates on the energy with estimates on the size of the convex body.

Lemma 2.1. Let N ≥ 2, and λ1, .., λN > 0. Letting E := (cid:81)N

i=1[0, λi], V := |E| and

where the constants implicitly appearing in (2.2) and (2.3) depend only on N and α.

2here and in the rest of the paper, we write f (cid:46) g if there exists C > 0 such that f ≤ Cg. If f (cid:46) g and

g (cid:46) f , we will simply write f ∼ g

V = (cid:81)N

i=1 λi and P (E) (cid:46) (cid:81)N−1

Proof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ ··· ≥ λN . Then, since
i=1 λi, taking the ratio of these two quantities, we obtain
N−1 Φ−1. Now, since the λi are decreasing (in particular λi ≥ λN for

Assume now that α > 0. Then, from diam(E) ∼ λ1, we get Iα(E) (cid:38) λ−α
together with λ1λ2 = V , this implies (2.2). If N ≥ 3, we infer as above that
Φ (cid:38) V

This gives (2.2). The case α = 0 follows analogously, using the fact that I0(E) ≥ C −

The next result follows directly from John’s lemma [15].

E ⊂ RN , up to a rotation and a translation, there exists R :=(cid:81)N

Lemma 2.2. There exists a dimensional constant CN > 0 such that for every convex body

i=1[0, λi], such that

R ⊆ E ⊆ CNR.

As a consequence diam(E) ∼ diam(R), |E| ∼ |R|, P (E) ∼ P (R) and Iα(E) ∼ Iα(R) for
α > 0 (and exp(−I0(E)) ∼ exp(−I0(R))).

With these two preliminary results at hand, we can prove existence of minimizers for

(1.1).
Theorem 2.3. For every Q > 0 and α ∈ [0, N ), (1.1) has a minimizer.
Proof. Let En be a minimizing sequence and let us prove that diam(En) is uniformly
bounded. Let Rn be the parallelepipeds given by Lemma 2.2. Since diam(En) ∼ diam(Rn),
it is enough estimating diam(Rn) from above. Let us begin with the case α > 0. In this
case, since Iα(Rn) ≥ 0, by (2.1), applied with V = 1, we get

diam(Rn) (cid:46) P (Rn)N−1 (cid:46) FQ,α(En)N−1.
In the case α = 0, from (2.1) and (2.3) applied to V = 1, we get

P (Rn) (cid:38) exp

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

−I0(Rn)
N − 1
(cid:19)

−I0(Rn)
N − 1

so that

FQ,0(Rn) (cid:38) exp

+ I0(Rn),

from which we obtain that |I0(Rn)| is bounded and thus also P (Rn) is bounded, whence,
arguing as above, we obtain a uniform bound on diam(Rn).
Since the En’s are convex sets, up to a translation, we can extract a subsequence which
converges in the Hausdorﬀ (and L1) topology to some convex body E of volume one. Since

5

the perimeter functional is lower semicontinuous with respect to the L1 convergence, and
the Riesz potential Iα is lower semicontinuous with respect to the Hausdorﬀ convergence
(cid:3)
(see [20, 26] and [11, Prop. 2.2]), we get that E is a minimizer of (1.1).

3. Regularity of the planar charge distribution for the logarithmic

potential

In this section we focus on the case N = 2 and α = 0. Relying on classical results
on harmonic measures, we show that for every convex set E, the corresponding optimal
measure µ for I0(E) is absolutely continuous with respect to H1
∂E with Lp estimates.
Upon making that connection between µ and harmonic measures, this fact is fairly clas-
sical. However, since we could not ﬁnd a proper reference, we recall (and slightly adapt)
few useful results. Let us point out that most deﬁnitions and results of this section extend
to the case N ≥ 3 and α = N − 2, and to more general classes of sets. In particular, for
bounded Lipschitz sets, the fact that harmonic measures are absolutely continuous with
respect to the surface measure with Lp densities for p > 2 was established in [5], and
extended later to more general domains (see for instance [17, 16, 14]). The interest for
harmonic measures stems from the fact that they bear a lot of geometric information (see
in particular [1, 17]). The main result of this section is the following.

Theorem 3.1. Let En be a sequence of compact convex bodies converging to a convex body
E and let µn be the associated equilibrium measures. Then, µn = fnH1
∂En and there
exists p > 2 and M > 0 (depending only on E) such that fn ∈ Lp(∂En) with

(cid:107)fn(cid:107)Lp(∂En) ≤ M.

Moreover, if E is smooth, then p can be taken arbitrarily large.

Remark 3.2. By applying the previous result with En = E, we get that that the equi-
librium measure of a convex set is always in some Lp(∂E) with p > 2. We stress also that
the exponent p and the bound on the Lp norm of its equilibrium measure depend indeed
on the set: for instance, a sequence of convex sets with smooth boundaries converging to
a square cannot have equilibrium measures with densities uniformly bounded in Lp for
p > 4.

We will denote here Ω := Ec. Let us recall the deﬁnition of harmonic measures (see

[9, 17]).
Deﬁnition 3.3. Let Ω be a Lipschitz open set (bounded or unbounded) such that R2\∂Ω
has two connected components, and let X ∈ Ω, we denote by GX
Ω the Green function of Ω
with pole at X i.e. the unique distributional solution of

Ω = δX

and

Ω = 0

(3.1)

When it is clear from the context, we omit the dependence of GX , ωX or ω∞ on the domain
Ω.
Remark 3.4. For smooth domains, it is not hard to check that ωX = ∂νGXH1
and that ω∞ = ∂νuH1
unbounded, if h∞ is the harmonic function in Ω with h∞(z) = − 1
function u from (3.1) can also be deﬁned by u(z) = 1

∂Ω,
∂Ω where ν is the inward unit normal to Ω. Moreover, for Ω

2π log |z| on ∂Ω, then the

2π log |z| + h∞(z).

We can now make the connection between harmonic measures and equilibrium mea-
sures. For E a Lipschitz bounded open set containing 0, let µ be the optimal measure for
I0(E) and let

(cid:90)

v(x) :=

∂E

− log(|x − y|)dµ(y).

Since

−∆v = 2πµ in R2,

v < I0(E) in Ec

and

v = I0(E) on ∂E,

if we let u := (2π)−1(I0(E) − v), we see that it satisﬁes (3.1) for Ω = Ec. Therefore,
µ = ω∞
Ec (recall that µ(∂E) = 1). For Lipschitz sets Ω, it is well-known that ω∞ is
absolutely continuous with respect to H1
∂Ω with density in Lp(∂Ω) for some p > 1 (see
[9, Th. 4.2]). However, we will need a stronger result, namely that it is in Lp(∂Ω) for
some p > 2, with estimates on the Lp norm depending only on the geometry of Ω.
Given a convex body E and a point x ∈ ∂E, we call angle of ∂E at x the angle
spanned by the tangent cone ∪λ>0λ(E − x).

We now state a crucial lemma which relates in a quantitative way the regularity of E
with the integrability properties of the corresponding harmonic measure. This result is a
slight adaptation of [28, Thm. 2].
Lemma 3.5. Let E be a convex body containing the origin in its interior, let ζ ∈ (0, π]
+ 1 if ζ < π and pc := +∞ if ζ = π. Let
be the minimal angle of ∂E, and let pc := π
π−ζ
also En be a sequence of convex bodies converging to E in the Hausdorﬀ topology. Then,
for every 1 ≤ p < pc, there exists C(p, ∂E) such that for n large enough (depending on p),
every conformal map ψn : Ec

n → B1 with ψn(∞) = 0 satisﬁes

|ψ(cid:48)
n|p ≤ C(p, ∂E),

where we indicate by |ψ(cid:48)
function). In particular, for n large enough, ψ(cid:48)

n| the absolute value of the derivative of ψn (seen as a complex

n ∈ Lp(∂En) for some p > 2.

Proof. The scheme of the proof follows that of [28, Thm. 2, Eq.
(9)], thus we limit
ourselves to point out the main diﬀerences. We begin by noticing that although [28, Thm.
2] is written for bounded sets, up to composing with the map z → z−1 this does not create
any diﬃculty.
We ﬁrst introduce some notation from [28]. Given a convex body E we let ∂E =
{γ(s) : s ∈ [0, L]} be an arclength parametrization of ∂E. Notice that, for every s, the
left and right derivatives γ(cid:48)±(s) exist and the angle v(s) between γ(cid:48)(s) and a ﬁxed direction,
say e1, is a function of bounded variation. Up to changing the orientation of ∂E, we can
assume that v is increasing. We then let

¯η := max

s

[v(s+) − v(s−)] ≥ 0.

Notice that ζ = π − η is the minimal angle of ∂E.

Letting ϕn := ψ−1

n , we want to prove that there exists C(p, ∂E) such that

(cid:90)

∂B1

|ϕ(cid:48)
n|−p ≤ C(p, ∂E),

for n large enough and for p < π/η By a change of variables, this yields (3.2). Let
p < p(cid:48) < π/η, and let as in [28],

h :=

1
2π

(pη + π)

and

h(cid:48) :=

1
2π

(p(cid:48)η + π),

so that

πh
p

>

πh(cid:48)
p(cid:48) > η.

Let now vn (resp. v)be the angle functions corresponding to the sets En (resp. E). As in
[28], there exists δ > 0 such that for s − s(cid:48) ≤ δ,

v(s) − v(s(cid:48)) ≤ πh(cid:48)
p(cid:48) .

By the convexity of En and by the convergence of En to E, for n large enough and for
s − s(cid:48) ≤ δ we get that

vn(s) − vn(s(cid:48)) ≤ πh
p

.

Let Ln := H1(∂En) and let us extend vn to R by letting for s ≥ 0, vn(s) := vn(Ln(cid:98)s/Ln(cid:99))+
vn(s − Ln(cid:98)s/Ln(cid:99)), and similarly for s ≤ 0, so that vn is an increasing function with (vn)(cid:48)
periodic of period Ln. Let now kn := (cid:100)Ln/δ(cid:101) ∈ N and δn := L/kn. By the convergence
of En to E, kn and δn are uniformly bounded from above and below. For t ∈ [0, δn], and

contain the origin in their interior. As observed above, we then have µn = ω∞

We will also need a similar estimate for C1,β sets.

Lemma 3.6. Let E be a convex set with boundary of class C1,β. Then, the optimal charge
distribution µ is of class C0,β and in particular it is in L∞(∂E). Moreover, (cid:107)µ(cid:107)C0,β depends
only on the C1,β norm of ∂E.
Proof. Up to translation we can assume that 0 ∈ E with dist(0, ∂E) ≥ c (with c depending
only on the C1,β character of ∂E). By [24, Thm. 3.6], there exists a conformal mapping
ψ of class C1,β which maps Ec into B1 with ψ(∞) = 0 and (cid:107)ψ(cid:107)C1,β (Ec) controlled by the
C1,β character of ∂E. Since, as before, µ = (ψ−1)(cid:93)ω0
, and the claim follows by Lemma
(cid:3)
3.5.

4. C1,1-regularity of minimizers for N = 2 and α = 0

In this section we show that any minimizer of (1.1) has boundary of class C1,1. We
begin by showing that we can drop the volume constraint, by adding a volume penalization
to the functional. This penalization is commonly used in isoperimetric type problems (see
for instance [6, 10] and references therein). Let Λ be a positive number and deﬁne the
functional

GΛ(E) := P (E) + Q2I0(E) + Λ||E| − 1| .

Lemma 4.1. For every Q0 > 0, there exists Λ > 0 such that, if Λ > Λ and Q ≤ Q0, the
minimizers of

min

E⊆R2, E convex

GΛ(E)

(4.1)

are also minimizers of (1.1) and vice-versa.
Proof. By repeating the proof of Theorem 2.3 it is easy to show that for any Λ > 0, GΛ
admits a minimizer. Notice that the minimum in (4.1) is always less or equal than the
minimum in (1.1). We are thus left to prove the opposite inequality. Let Λ > 0 be given
and let E be a minimizer of GΛ. Assume that E is not a minimizer for FQ,0. In this case
we get that

Let B be a ball with |B| = 1. Then

σ := ||E| − 1| > 0.

diam(E) − Q2 log(diam(E)) ≤ GΛ(E) ≤ GΛ(B) = FQ,0(B) (cid:46) 1,

where the constant involved depends only on Q0. Therefore diam(E) is bounded by a
constant depending only on Q0. From this, we deduce that Λσ is itself also bounded
by a constant (again depending only on Q0). From now on we assume that |E| < 1, or
equivalently, |E| = 1 − σ, since the other case is analogous. Let us deﬁne

Let now E be a minimizer of (4.1). In order to prove the regularity of E, we shall
construct a competitor in the following way: since E is a convex body, there exists ε0
such that for ε ≤ ε0, and every x0 ∈ ∂E, we have ∂E ∩ ∂Bε(x0) = {xε

x to y and Lε (if Lx,y is parallel to Lε, we set γε(x, y) = 0).

Before stating the main result of this section, we prove two simple regularity lemmata.

Figure 1.

Lemma 4.2. Let 0 < β ≤ 1 and C, ε0 > 0 be given. Then, every convex body E such that
for every x0 ∈ ∂E and every ε ≤ ε0,

∆V ≤ Cε2+β

(4.2)

is C1,β with C1,β norm depending only on the Lipschitz character of ∂E, ε0 and C.
Proof. Let x0 ∈ ∂E be ﬁxed. Since E is convex, there exist R > 0 and a convex function
u : I → R such that ∂E ∩ BR(x0) = {(t, u(t))
t ∈ I} for some interval I ⊂ R.
Furthermore, (cid:107)u(cid:48)(cid:107)L∞ (cid:46) 1. Let ¯x ∈ ∂E ∩ BR(x0). Without loss of generality, we can
assume that ¯x = 0 = (0, u(0)). By convexity of u, up to adding a linear function, we can
further assume that u ≥ 0 in I. Thanks to the Lipschitz bound on u, for x = (t, u(t)) ∈
∂E ∩ BR(x0), we have

:

|x| = (t2 + |u(t)|2)1/2 ∼ t.

Let now ε > 0. For δ > 0, let −1 (cid:28) tδ

(see the notation above). By (4.3), there exists λ > 0 depending only on the Lipschitz
| ≥ ε. Without loss of generality, we can now assume that
character of u, such that |tλε
u(−ε) ≤ u(ε).
In particular, considering the ∆V associated to λε, we have that (see

This proves that there exists ε1 > 0 such that for 0 ≤ ε ≤ ε1,

ψ(ε) (cid:46) ε2+β.

Putting this back into (4.4) and dividing by ε, we get

u(−ε) + u(ε) (cid:46) ε1+β + ε−1ψ(ε) (cid:46) ε1+β.

In other words, we have proven that u is diﬀerentiable in zero with u(cid:48)(0) = 0 and that for
|ε| small enough,

|u(ε) − u(0) − u(cid:48)(0)ε| (cid:46) ε1+β.

Since the point zero was arbitrarily chosen, this yields that u is diﬀerentiable everywhere
and that for t, s ∈ I with |t − s| ≤ ε1,

|u(t) − u(s) − u(cid:48)(s)(t − s)| (cid:46) |t − s|β+1,

which is equivalent to the C1,β regularity of ∂E3.

(cid:3)

Lemma 4.3. Suppose that the minimizer E for (4.1) has boundary of class C1,β, for some
0 < β < 1. Then, for every x0 ∈ ∂E, x ∈ Σε and y ∈ BR(x0),

γε(x, y) (cid:46) εβ + |x − y|β.

(4.5)

Proof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that x0 = 0. As in the proof of
Lemma 4.2, since E is convex and of class C1,β, in the ball BR(0), for a small enough
R, ∂E is a graph over its tangent of a C1,β function u. Up to a rotation, we can fur-
ther assume that this tangent is horizontal so that for some interval I ⊂ R, we have
∂E∩BR(0) = {(t, u(t)) : t ∈ I}. In particular, if x = (t, u(t)) ∈ ∂E∩BR(0), |u(t)| (cid:46) |t|1+β
and |u(cid:48)(t)| (cid:46) |t|β.

First, if |x − y| (cid:46) ε (which thanks to (4.3) amounts to |t − s| (cid:46) ε and thus since x ∈ Σε,

MICHAEL GOLDMAN, MATTEO NOVAGA, AND BERARDO RUFFINI

Theorem 4.4. Every minimizer of (4.1) is C1,1. Moreover, for every Q0 and every
Q ≤ Q0, the C1,1 character of ∂E depends only on Q0, the Lipschitz character of ∂E and
(cid:107)f(cid:107)Lp(∂E).
Proof. Let E be a minimizer of (4.1), x0 ∈ ∂E be ﬁxed and let ε ≤ ε0. With the above
notation in force, we begin by observing that using Eε as a competitor, by minimality of
E for (4.1), and by means of the estimate

||E| − 1| − ||Eε| − 1| ≥ −||E| − |Eε|| = −∆V,

we get

(4.8)
We are thus going to estimate ∆I0, ∆P and ∆V in terms of ε and γε. This will give us a
quantitative decay estimate for γε. This in turn, in light of (4.9) below and Lemma 4.2,
will provide the desired regularity of E.

Q2∆I0 ≥ ∆P − Λ∆V.

Step 1 (Volume estimate): In this ﬁrst step, we prove that

∆V ∼ ε2γε .

Denote by z the projection of Π(x) on the line containing x and y. Then, since the
projection is a 1-Lipschitz function, it holds |z − y| ≤ |Π(x) − y|. Thus,

|x − y| − |y − Π(x)| = |x − z| + |z − y| − |y − Π(x)| ≤ |x − z|.

Arguing as in Step 1, we get |x − Π(x)| ≤ |xε

Step 4 (C1,β regularity): We now prove that E has boundary of class C1,β. To this
aim, we can assume that ∆V (cid:28) ∆P . Indeed, if ∆V (cid:38) ∆P , thanks to (4.9) and (4.10),
we would get γε (cid:46) ε and thus ∆V (cid:46) ε3, which by Lemma 4.2 would already ensure the
C1,1 regularity of ∂E. Using (4.8), (4.10), (4.13), (4.15) and (4.17), we get

for some β > 0 and we can conclude, by means of (4.9) and Lemma 4.2, that ∂E is C1,β.
Step 5 (C1,1 regularity): Thanks to Lemma 3.6, we get that f ∈ L∞ with (cid:107)f(cid:107)L∞
depending only on the Lipschitz character of ∂E and on (cid:107)f(cid:107)Lp. Using this new information,
we can improve (4.13), (4.15) and (4.17) to

Arguing as in Step 4, we ﬁnd γε (cid:46) Qε1/2 and thus ∂E is of class C1,1/2. In order to get

5. Minimality of the ball for N = 2 and Q small

We now use the regularity result obtained in Section 4 to prove that for small charges,

the only minimizers of FQ,0 in dimension two are balls.
Theorem 5.1. Let N = 2 and α = 0. There exists Q0 > 0 such that for Q < Q0, up to
translations, the only minimizer of (1.1) is the ball.
Proof. Let EQ be a minimizer of FQ,0 and let B be a ball of measure one. By minimality
of EQ, we have

P (EQ) − P (B) ≤ Q2 (I0(B) − I0(EQ)) ≤ Q2I0(B).

(5.1)

Using the quantitative isoperimetric inequality (see [8]), we infer
|EQ∆B|2 (cid:46) P (EQ) − P (B) ≤ Q2I0(B).

This implies that EQ converges to B in L1 as Q → 0. From the convexity of EQ, this
implies the convergence also in the Hausdorﬀ metric. Since the sets EQ are all uniformly
bounded and of ﬁxed volume, they are uniformly Lipschitz. Theorem 4.4 then implies
that ∂EQ are C1,1−regular sets with C1,1 norm uniformly bounded. Therefore, thanks to
the Arzel`a-Ascoli’s Theorem, we can write

∂EQ = {(1 + ϕQ(x))x : x ∈ ∂B} ,

with (cid:107)ϕQ(cid:107)C1,β converging to 0 as Q → 0 for every β < 1. From Lemma 3.6 we infer
that the optimal measures µQ for EQ are uniformly C0,β and in particular are uniformly
bounded. Using now [11, Prop 6.3], we get that for small enough Q,
L∞ (P (EQ) − P (B)) (cid:38) I0(B) − I0(EQ)

(cid:107)µQ(cid:107)2

Putting this into (5.1), we then obtain

P (EQ) − P (B) (cid:46) Q2(P (EQ) − P (B))

from which we deduce that for Q small enough, P (EQ) = P (B). Since, up to translations,
(cid:3)
the ball is the unique solution of the isoperimetric problem, this implies EQ = B.

6. Asymptotic behavior as Q → +∞

In this section we characterize the limit shape of (suitably rescaled) minimizers of FQ,α,

with α ∈ [0, 1], as the charge Q tends to +∞. For this, we ﬁx a sequence Qn → +∞.

Then, up to extracting a subsequence and up to rigid motions, the sets En converge in the

Let us now prove (6.1). By scaling, we can assume that L = V = 1. Thanks to the
concavity and positivity constraints, existence of a minimizer for (6.1) follows. Let f be
such a minimizer. Let us prove that we can assume that f is non-increasing. Notice ﬁrst
that by deﬁnition, there holds

This gives together with (6.4) the corresponding lower bound.

We can now prove a compactness result analogous to Proposition 6.1.

Proposition 6.8. Let En ∈ An,1 be such that supn (cid:98)Fn,1(En) < +∞. Then, up to extract-
focus on N = 3. Let Rn =(cid:81)3

ing a subsequence and up to rigid motions, the sets En converge in the Hausdorﬀ topology
to a segment [0, L] × {0}N , for some L ∈ (0, +∞).
Proof. We reason as in the proof of Proposition 6.1. Since the case N = 2 is easier, we
i=1[0, λi,n] be given by Lemma 2.2 and let us assume without
loss of generality that i (cid:55)→ λi,n is decreasing. Then (2.1) applied with V = Q−4
n (log Qn)−2,
directly yields an upper bound on λ1,n (and thus on diam(En)).

We now show that the diameter of En is also uniformly bounded from below. Unfor-
tunately, (2.2) does not give the right bound and we need to reﬁne it using (6.4). As in

It follows that the sets En are compact in the Hausdorﬀ topology, and any limit set

We can assume that supn (cid:98)Fn,1(En) < +∞, since otherwise there is nothing to prove. Let

We are left to prove the lower bound for the non-local part of the energy. Let En be be

Remark 6.10. As before, optimizing (cid:98)F1 with respect to L, one easily obtains the values

of LN,1 given in Theorem 1.4.

Remark 6.11. By analogy with results obtained in the setting of minimal Riesz energy
point conﬁgurations [12, 21], we believe that for every N ≥ 2, α > 1 and L > 0, (6.5) can
be generalized to

Iα([0, L] × [0, ε]N−1)

=

Cα
Lα ,

(6.9)

lim
ε→0

ε1−α

for some constant Cα depending only on α. This result would permit to extend Theorem
6.9 beyond α = 1. Let us point out that showing that the right-hand side of (6.9) is bigger
than the left-hand side can be easily obtained by plugging in the uniform measure as a
test measure. However, we are not able to prove the reverse inequality.
