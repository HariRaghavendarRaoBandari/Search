Abstract: We studied optical response of microcavity non-equilibrium
exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensate with saturable nonlinearity
under simultaneous resonant and non-resonant pumping. We demonstrated
the emergence of multistabile behavior due to the satutration of the excitonic
absorbtion. Stable periodic Rabi- type oscillations of the excitonic and
photonic condensate components in the regime of the stationary pump
and their transition to the chaotic dynamics through the cascade of Hopf
bifurcations by tuning of the electrical pump are revealed.

Introduction

Exciton-polaritons are quasiparticles emerging due to the strong coupling between quantum
well excitons and cavity photons in high quality factor cavities [1]. Due to their hybrid light-
matter nature, polaritons exhibit set of intriguing collective effects such as high temperature
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) [3], superﬂuidity [4] and macroscopic self trapping [5].
Those phenomena originate from very small effective mass of polaritons inherited from the
photonic component combined with strong polariton- polariton interactions provided by the
excitonic component.

Together with the intriguing fundamental properties, exciton-polaritons are attractive for their
perspective applications, mainly in the ﬁeld of low-threshold bosonic lasers [6] and all-optical
integrated circuits [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. The advantage of the polaritonic platform over
the conventional nonlinear optical materials for the purposes of the development of optical logic
elements is their ultra-strong and ultra-fast nonlinear response [15, 16, 17].

One of the important features of non-equilibrium exciton-polariton BEC that can be used
in practice relays to so-called permanent Rabi oscillations occurring between lower and upper
branch polaritons [18] or between photonic and excitonic components of the condensate [19,
20]. An enhansement of the coherence time of polariton Rabi oscillations has been reported
experimentally in Ref. [21]. The oscillation pattern strongly depends on the mechanism of the
pumping, but the role of different contributions to the nonlinear excitonic responce and different
types of the pumping in polariton Rabi oscillations in microcavities is still not fully clariﬁed.

In this paper we examine the problem of the onset of permanent Rabi oscillations between
excitonic and photonic components in the microcavity in the presence of strong nonlinearities
caused by both exciton-exciton interaction and saturation of the excitonic absorbtion provided
by the effects of Pauli blocking [23, 24, 25, 26]. The latter plays major role in the regime
of very strong pumps. Indeed, as exciton density nX approaches the critical concentration of

1/a2
B, where aB is the excitonic Bohr radius, the system undergoes the Mott transition, and the
excitons dissolve forming the electron-hole plasma. We also take into account the possibility
of having two types of the pump: resonant pump of the cavity mode by external laser with
well deﬁned frequency and non- resonant pump of the excitonic component provided e.g. by
electrical injection of the electrons and holes into active region [6, 22]

multaneously with an electrical pump PX and optical pump PC.

It is well known that one of the direct consequences of the polariton nonlinear response is
the optical bistability [27, 28]. Importantly, bistable behavior was observed for the cases of
both resonant optical and non- resonant pump when excitonic subsystem is pumped via the
electron- hole reservoir. The mechanisms of the bistability, however, are very different in these
two cases. For resonant optical pump it appears due to the resonance between interaction-
induced blueshift and detuning between the energies of the cavity mode and the pumping laser.
On the contrary, for the non- resonant pump bistabile behavior was reported for the electrically
pumped polaritonic diode as resulting from the transition to the weak coupling regime [29] or
dependence of the electron-hole tunneling lifetime on the carrier density provided by the effects
of the screening [30].

In this work we consider the coupled exciton-photon system in a microcavity conﬁguration
shown in Fig. 1 subject to the simultaneous electrical and optical pump and account for the
exciton-photon coupling saturation due to the Mott transition. We reveal that the system may
exhibit the multistable behaviour as well as undergo the transitions from stationary solutions to
stable periodic oscillations of excitonic and photonic components and then chaotic behaviour
if the intensities of the pumps are tuned. The multistable behaviour has been previously ob-
served in the microcavities [31, 32, 33], however conventionally the observation of multista-
bility requires an account for spin(polarization) degree of freedom. Contrary to this case, in
this paper multistability emerges due to the interplay of the exciton-exciton interaction and the
saturation of the exciton-photon coupling. The chaotic behaviour of exciton polaritons has been
previously studied in the optically pumped polariton Josephson junctions [34] and planar mi-
crocavities with briken polarization symmetry [35, 36]. In this work the transition to the chaotic
behaviour can be achieved by tailoring the electrical pump which could be advantageous for
the applications in chaos communication devices [37].

The remaining paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we introduce the Hamiltonian of
the system and obtain the equations of motion for the excitonic and photonic amplitudes as
functions of time. In section 3 the analysis of the stationary solutions is performed. Section 4
contains the stability analysis of the stationary solutions. Moreover, the regimes of limiting cy-
cles characterized by permanent oscillations for excitonic and photonic ﬁeld amplitudes as well
as Hopf bifurcations and transition to chaos through period- doubling cascade are discussed.
The conclusions are presented in section 5.

2. Model

We consider the coupled exciton-photon semiclassical Hamiltonian written as

H = ¯hw Cf ∗f + ¯hw X c ∗c +

g

2|c |4 + ¯hW R(cid:0)1− l a2

B|c |2(cid:1) (f ∗c + c ∗f ) ,

(1)

where f , c are the complex amplitudes of the photonic and excitonic macroscopic wave func-
tions, respectively, w C,w X are the frequencies of the excitonic and photonic mode, g deﬁnes the
strength of the exciton-exciton interaction and can be approximated by [39] g ≈ 6Eba2
B, where
Eb is the exciton binding energy and aB is the exciton Bohr radius. The dimensionless constant
l deﬁnes the efﬁciency of the saturation of the excitonic absorption. If l = 0 the saturation
is absent and one regains the conventional Hamiltonian of coupled excitons and photons with
only source of nonlinearity provided by exciton- exciton interactions which was extensively
used for description of the polariton dynamics and leads to the standard bistable behavior in
the regime of the resonant pump (see e.g. [38] and references therein). Our main goal will be
to analyze the additional source of nonlinearity appearing for l
6= 0. Note, that Mott transition
from excitons to electron-hole plasma occurs roughly when the distance between the individual
excitons become comparable to their Bohr radius, and thus realistically l ≈ 1.

Throughout the paper we neglect spatial degree of freedom assuming the condensate to be
at zero momentum state. Equations of motions for the excitonic and photonic amplitudes are
x = {f , c }. We also will phenomenologi-
derived from the Hamiltonian as i¯h ˙x = ¶ H /¶x
∗,
cally add the terms corresponding to the exciton and photon damping g X ,g C, as well optical and
electrical pumping terms, PCe−iw t , PXc (1− l a2
B|c |2) , respectively. Note, that saturation of
the incoherent pump originating from the same effect of Mott transition is introduced. Making
the substitution x = ˜x e−iw ta−1
B , x = {f , c } and introducing the dimensionless time t = W Rt
brings us to a couple of dimensionless differential equations:

(2)

i ˙˜f = ( ˜d C − i ˜g C) ˜f + (1− l | ˜c |2) ˜c + ˜PC,
i ˙˜c = ( ˜d X − i ˜g X ) ˜c + (1− l | ˜c |2) ˜f − 2l ˜c Re(cid:0) ˜f ∗ ˜c (cid:1) + ˜g| ˜c |2 ˜c + i ˜PX ˜c (1− l | ˜c |2),

where ˜d C(X) = (w C(X)−w )/W R are detunings of the excitonic and photonic modes with respect
to the laser frequency and all the parameters with the dimension of energy were normalized to
W R. Thereafter we remove tilde sign from the symbols to spare the notations.

In the stationary case ˙f = 0, ˙c = 0, the photon amplitude can be expressed via the exciton

amplitude as

f = −

where tanj 0 = g C/d C. Equation (3) can then be substituted to the equation for c . We then

At ﬁrst, we analyse the stationary solutions of Eqs. (4),(5).

We are looking for the real solutions for X ∈ [0;1] and j ∈ [0;2p [. We start from the simplest
case of only the optical pumping, setting PX = 0 in Eqs. (4),(5). Typical results for this limit are

In order to elucidate the multistability regime we here adopt the assumption of off-resonant

pumping and high-Q cavity, assuming g C ≪ d C. We also assume zero detuning between the
exciton and photon mode leading to d C = d X = d Within this approximation, sinf 0 ≈ 0, cosf 0 ≈
signum(d ), and cos(f − f 0) ≈ ± cosf 0. Eq. (4) thus reduces to

3l X 5 − (gd + 4l )X 3− (d 2 − 1)X ± (1− 3l X 2)PC = 0.

(7)

Let us note that in the absence of the losses, the threshold for the multistability appearance
should be obtained at arbitrary small pumping intensity. Thus, it is instructive to analyze the
limiting case PC = 0. Then, in the non-saturable case non-trivial solutions of Eq. (7) satisfy the
condition

and for the case with l = 1 we get

gd X 2 + (d 2 − 1) = 0,

3X 4 − (gd + 4)X 2− (d 2 − 1) = 0.

existence, since a positive root exists only if d ∈]− ¥

For the nonsaturable case of Eq. (8) we can readily obtain the condition for the bistability
,−1[∪]0;1[. Thus in the non-saturable
system the bistability can arise only if the resonant pump is either above the upper polariton
frequency or between the lower polariton frequency and the exciton frequency.

For the saturable case of Eq. (9), there are three distinct cases: the equation has no roots in
the region ]0;1[ and thus there is no multistable behaviour in the system. If it has one root,
then system will be bistable. Finally, if it has two roots, the tri-stability may be observed. In
stark contrast to the non-saturable case, the tri-stability is observed in the region d ∈]− 1;0[
i.e. when the resonant pump is between the exciton and upper polariton frequency, where no
bistable behaviour is observed for the case of l = 0. We thus observe that the multistability
behaviour originates merely due to the saturation nonlinearity.

In order to support the approximate analytical results we have performed the numerical cal-
culation of the stationary solutions of the system. For the numerical calculations we use the
following set of parameters: the Rabi-splitting W R is set to 10 meV, usual for the GaAs based
structures, the photon lifetime is set to 2 ps which can be easily achieved in the state of the art
high-quality microcavities and corresponds to g C/W R = 0.03; the binding energy EB ≈ 4 meV
which is usual for the GaAs structures and the Bohr radius aB = 10 nm. The optical pumping
intensity is bound by approximately 1 kW/cm2 which corresponds to the dimensionless P ≈ 1
and the electrical pumping current is bound by approximately 100m A which corresponds to
PX ≈ 1. These values of optical pump intensities and currents are easily achievable in the state
of the art microcavity set ups [30]. We take l = 1 and compare the results with the case l = 0.
The results of the numerical calculations are shown in Figs. 2(a).
In Fig. 2(a) one can see that for the detunings lying in the region ]−W R;0[ there is no bistable
behaviour in the non-saturable case (green dotted line), but we observe the tri-stability for l = 1
(green solid line).

Despite the presence of the multistability regime in the phase diagram of the system, it is
problematic to construct an experimental protocol exhibiting the multistable behaviour. this is
connected to the large PC behaviour of the system. Namely, as can be seen from Eq. (7) in this
limit the amplitude of the exciton ﬁeld is approaching 1/√3. At this limit, exciton and photon
subsystems become decoupled and increasing the photon pumping will not affect the exciton
subsystem. This asymptote is shown with a dashed line in Fig. 2(a). Thus it is not possible to
switch between different stable exciton states by adiabatic change of the optical pump.

We now consider the case of simultaneous electrical and optical pump acting upon the sys-

tem. One of the effects observed in this case, is the shift of the |c | vs PC dependence to the
larger values of PC as PX is increased. To illustrate that we can expand Eqs. (4),(5) for small and
large PC respectively. We again assume limit of low radiative losses g C ≪ d C, i.e. sinf 0 ≈ 0. In
this case, Eq. (5) yields sinf = −XPX|d C|/PC. The requirement for the real phase f
condition X < PC/|(d C|PX ). Thus, as electrical pump increases, the exciton amplitude will de-
crease slower with the optical pump intensity. This also can be observed in Fig. 2(c) where the
dependence of the exciton amplitude vs electric pump for different values of PC is shown. We
can see that at the low branch of the stationary solutions, lying below the asymptote |c | = 1/√3

the exciton amplitude decays with increasing the pump intensity. In order to better illustrate the
exciton amplitude dependence on the electrical and optical pump, the three dimensional plot of

leads to the

|c | vs PC and PX is shown in Fig. 2(d).
4. Stability Analysis

To analyze the stability of the obtained stationary solutions we have computed the Jacobian of
the system at the stationary points [40]. The appearance of the positive real parts of at least one
eigenvalue of the Jacobian indicates the unstable behaviour. The stable stationary points are
shown in bold in Figs. 2(a-c). We have focused at the regime of the detuning d
lying in the re-
gion [−W
;0] corresponding to the tri-stable behaviour in the saturable case. We have identiﬁed
the three types of the non-stationary dynamics of the system which are shown in Figs.3. The
ﬁrst type is the periodic oscillations of the excitonic and photonic components of the conden-
sate. This behaviour is corresponding to the limiting cycle [40] and is shown at Figs. 3(a,b,c).

Relevant time dependent behaviour of photonic |f | and excitonic |c | amplitudes is shown at

Fig. 4. Physically, this regime occurs due to the balance between dissipation and pumping in
the presence of the nonlinearity and can be recognized as permanent Rabi oscillations in the

stable.

The transition from the stationary solutions to the limiting cycle occurs as we decrease the
electrical pump PX and as shown at Fig. 2(c). The spectrum of the oscillations is shown at
Fig. 3(a). It can be seen that the oscillations occur primarily at the frequency of ˜W ≈ 0.95W R.
However, the small peaks corresponding to the multiples of W
in the phase space projections (|f |,|c |) and (Rec ,Imc ) in this case are closed contours as it

is illustrated in Figs. 3(b,c). We also observed that the closed contour contains the stationary
point of the dynamical system which signiﬁes the stability of the limiting cycle.

Further decreasing of PX leads to the period multiplication in the system which is shown
in Figs. 3(d,e,f). The spectrum that is shown in Fig. 3(d) exhibits the peaks at the frequencies
5 ˜W /5. We note that transition to 5th order multiplication of the period of the structure is sharp
i.e. the system abruptly switches to the period multiplication by a factor of 5 rather than by
consecutive period doubling. In this case the trajectories shown in Fig. 3(e,f) are still closed
contours while with far more complex topology. For the case of l = 0 with the same parameters,
the transition to the permanent Rabi oscillations, i.e. limiting cycle is observed.

As the electrical pump is decreased further the system undergoes the transition to chaotic
behaviour through a series of consecutive period multiplication. The spectrum in this case,
shown in Fig. 3(g) becomes effectively a continuous one and the trajectories shown in Fig. 3(h,i)
become unclosed. For the non-saturable case l = 0 at these parameters the system is stable
again.

We have also observed a threshold of the optical pump intensity of 0.06, below which the
solutions are stable regardless of the electrical pump intensity. For the non-saturable case the
threshold corresponds to the 0.11.

5. Conclusions

We analyzed the dynamics of the excitonic and photonic ﬁelds in a microcavity under simulta-
neous optical and electric pump accounting for the exciton-photon coupling saturation provided
by Pauli exclusion principle. We have shown that in the limit of the vanishing electrical pump
the system may exhibit the multistable behaviour at certain values of the detunings between the
frequencies of the photon mode and the pump. Moreover, we observed the transition from the
stable solutions to the chaotic behavior through the cascade of period multiplication as electri-
cal pump in the system is tuned. The discovered regimes can be useful for further development
of applications of polariton lasers.
