We describe Lagrangian algebras in twisted Drinfeld centres for ﬁnite groups.

Using the full centre construction, we establish a 1-1 correspondence between La-

Introduction

In this paper, we classify Lagrangian algebras in group-theoretical modular categories.
This, in particular, gives a classiﬁcation of physical modular invariants for group-theoretical
modular data (a problem raised in [2]). It should be mentioned that the set of labels for
physical modular invariants was obtained in [12] (using the language of module categories).
What was missing was a way of recovering the modular invariant corresponding to a label.
By establishing a correspondence between Lagrangian algebras and module categories, and
by computing the characters of Lagrangian algebras, we give a method for determining
modular invariants corresponding to module categories.

By a group-theoretical modular category Z(G, α), we mean the monoidal (or Drinfeld)
centre Z(V(G, α)) of the category of vector spaces V(G, α) graded by a ﬁnite group G.
Here, α is a 3-cocycle of G with coeﬃcients in the multiplicative group k∗ of the ground
ﬁeld, which is used to twist the standard associativity constraint for the tensor product
of graded vector spaces. More precisely, we describe objects of Z(G, α) explicitly as G-
graded vector spaces with compatible G-action (section 2.1), and prove later (section 3.1)
that Z(G, α) is isomorphic to the monoidal centre Z(V(G, α)).

A commutative algebra A in a braided fusion category C is Lagrangian if any local
A-module in C is a direct sum of copies of A (we recall basic concepts of braided tensor
categories in section 1). We classify Lagrangian and more general indecomposable com-
mutative separable (etale for short) algebras in Z(G, α) in two steps. First, we describe
etale algebras with the trivial grading (section 2.3). These are nothing but indecomposable
commutative separable algebras with a G-action and hence are just function algebras on
transitive G-sets (we work over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k). Up to isomorphism, they
are labelled by (conjugacy classes of) subgroups H ⊂ G. Then we identify the category
of local modules Z(G, α)loc
k(G/H) with the group-theoretical modular category Z(H, α|H)
(theorem 2.10). A general etale algebra in Z(G, α) is an extension of its trivial degree
component, and hence is an etale algebra in one of Z(G, α)loc
k(G/H). Considered as an alge-
bra in Z(H, α|H), it has the one-dimensional trivial degree component. Our second step
(section 2.4) is to classify such algebras (proposition 2.15) and their categories of local
modules (theorem 2.17). Then in section 2.5, we combine the results obtaining the de-
scription of all etale algebras in Z(G, α) (theorem 2.19) and their local modules (theorem
2.20). As a corollary, we get a classiﬁcation of Lagrangian algebras in Z(G, α) (corollary
2.21). They are parametrised by (conjugacy classes of) subgroups H ⊂ G together with a
coboundary d(γ) = α|H matching with the answer from [12]. In section 3, we explain this
matching by identifying Lagrangian algebras with full centres of indecomposable separable
algebras in V(G, α) (theorem 3.2). Finally, after recalling the character theory for objects
of Z(G, α) (section 4.1), we compute characters of Lagrangian algebras (theorem 4.8). We
treat the case G = S3 (the symmetric group on 3 symbols) as an example (section 4.3).

This paper extends the results of [3] to the case of Z(G, α) with a nontrivial cocycle α.
It could have been titled “Modular invariants for group-theoretical modular data II”. The

2

scheme of the proof we follow here is very similar to [3]. However, the present paper is not
a mere extension of [3]: the presence of a nontrivial cocycle makes all constructions and
computations much more elaborate. For example, to identify categories of local modules
in section 2.3, we design a recognition tool by looking at more general fusion categories of
group theoretic origin (the appendix).

1 Preliminaries

Here, we recall a number of preliminary concepts. Throughout k is the ground ﬁeld of
characteristic zero and Vect = Vect k is the category of (ﬁnite dimensional) vector spaces
over k.

1.1 Algebras and modules

Let C be a monoidal category. An associative unital algebra in C is an object A ∈ C together
with two morphisms µ : A ⊗ A → A and ι : I → A such that

and

µ(µ ⊗ IdA) = µ(IdA ⊗ µ),

µ(ι ⊗ IdA) = IdA = µ(IdA ⊗ ι).

By an “algebra” , we will mean an associative unital algebra.
Let A ∈ C be an algebra. A right A-module is an object M ∈ C together with a

morphism ν : M ⊗ A → M such that

ν(ν ⊗ IdA) = ν(IdM ⊗ µ).

Left A-modules are deﬁned similarly. An A-B-bimodule M ∈ C is a left A-module and a
right B-module (B ∈ C is another algebra) such that the diagram of module action maps

A⊗M⊗B

A⊗M

M⊗B

/ M

commutes.
We denote the category of right A-modules by CA, and that of A-B-bimodules by ACB.

1.2 Separable algebras

For an algebra A in a spherical category (with the spherical structure sX : X → X ∗∗)
denote by τ : A → I (the canonical trace function) the composition

1coevA/

/ A⊗A⊗A∗ µ1

A

/ A⊗A∗

sA1

/ A∗∗⊗A∗ evA∗

/ I

An algebra A is said to be separable if the following composition is a nondegenerate pairing
(denoted e : A ⊗ A → I):

A⊗A

µ

/ A

tA /

/ I

Nondegeneracy of e means that there is a morphism κ : I → A ⊗ A such that the compo-
sitions

A 1⊗κ−→ A⊗3 e⊗1−→ A
A κ⊗1−→ A⊗3 1⊗e−→ A

are the identity.

If A ∈ C is a separable algebra in a spherical fusion category, then the category CA of

right A-modules is semisimple.

We call an algebra A in a monoidal category C simple if any algebra homomorphism

A → B is a monomorphism.

Lemma 1.1. Let A be an indecomposable separable algebra in a spherical fusion category
C. Then A is simple.

Proof. If an algebra A is not simple then there is a surjective (but not bijective) algebra
homomorphism A → B. Via the inverse image along this homomorphism the category
of B-modules CB becomes a full subcategory of CA. Moreover CB is a full left C-module
subcategory of CA.
Recall from [7, Proposition 3.9.] that a semisimple module category over a fusion category
is a direct sum of its simple module subcategories. In particular, CB is a direct summand
of CA as a C-module category. Hence the algebra C(I, A) in Vect (which coincides with
the algebra EndC (IdCA) of C-module endomorphisms of the identity functor of CA) is a
non-trivial direct sum. Thus A is decomposable.

1.3 Commutative algebras and local modules
Let now C be a braided monoidal category with the braiding cX,Y : X ⊗ Y ∼−→ Y ⊗ X.
An algebra A = hA, µ, ιi in C is commutative if

Following [5] we call an indecomposable commutative and separable algebra etale.

µ = µ ◦ cA,A.

A right A-module M = hM, νi is said to be local if the following diagram commutes:

M ⊗ A ν

cM,A

M

ν

A ⊗ M

cA,M

/ M ⊗ A

We denote by Cloc
Recall from [13] that (in case C has coequalisers) the category CA is monoidal with respect
to the relative tensor product ⊗A and that the category Cloc

A the full subcategory of CA consisting of local right A-modules.

A is braided.

An algebra L in a(n additive) braided monoidal category C is said to be a Lagrangian

algebra if any local L-module is a direct sum of copies of the regular module L.
Note that in the case when C is a k-linear braided monoidal category L is Lagrangian iﬀ
the category Cloc

L is equivalent to the category Vect k of k-vector spaces.

The following statement was proved in [8]; we state it here without proof.

Lemma 1.2. Let (A, m, i) be a commutative algebra in a braided category C. Let (B, µ, ι)
be an algebra in CA. Deﬁne µ and ι as compositions

B ⊗ B

/ B ⊗A B

µ

/ B,

1

i

/ A ι

/ B.

Then (B, µ, ι) is an algebra in C.
The map ι : A → B is a homomorphism of algebras in C.
The algebra (B, µ, ι) in C is separable or commutative if and only if the algebra (B, µ, ι) in
CA is such.

The functor (cid:0)Cloc

B given by

B −→ Cloc

A (cid:1)loc
(M, m : B ⊗A M → M) 7→ (cid:16)M, m : B ⊗ M → B ⊗A M m−→ M(cid:17)

(1)

is a braided monoidal equivalence.

1.4 Full centre

Recall from [4] that the full centre Z(A) of an algebra A in a monoidal category C is an
object of the monoidal centre Z(C) together with a morphism Z(A) → A in C, terminal
among pairs (Z, ζ), where Z ∈ Z(C) and ζ : Z → A is a morphism in C such that the
following diagram commutes:

Here zA is the half-braiding of Z as an object of Z(C). The terminality condition means
that for any such pair (Z, ζ) there is a unique morphism Z → Z(A) in the monoidal centre
Z(C), which makes the diagram

commute.

Recall that the α-induction is the tensor functor

α : Z(C) → ACA,

α(Z) = Z⊗A,

with the left A-module structure given by

A⊗Z⊗A

zA⊗1

/ Z⊗A⊗A

1⊗µ

/ Z⊗A

Proposition 1.3. The full centre Z(A) of an indecomposable separable algebra A in a fu-
sion category C coincides with the action internal end [A, A] ∈ Z(C) of the trivial bimodule
A ∈ ACA with respect to the Z(C)-action on ACA given by α-induction.
The category of modules Z(C)Z(A) is equivalent, as a fusion category, to the category ACA
of A-bimodules.

Proof. The universal property of the action internal end says that [A, A] is the terminal
object among (Z, z) where ξ ∈ Z(C) and ξ : α(Z) → A is a morphism of A-bimodules.
The right A-module map ξ : Z⊗A → A is completely determined by the morphism ζ =
ξ(1⊗ι) : Z → A (which is still a left A-module map). The left A-module property for ζ is
exactly (2).
According to [11] the functors

−⊗[A,A]A

Z(C)[A,A]

ACA

[A,−]

are quasi-inverse equivalences. The tensor structure

[A, M]⊗[A,A][A, N] → [A, M⊗AN]

(3)

for the functor [A, −] comes from the universal property of the action internal hom. Indeed
the composition

α([A, M]⊗[A, N])⊗AA ≃ α([A, M])⊗AA⊗Aα([A, N])⊗AA

/ M⊗AN

induces the map [A, M]⊗[A, N] → [A, M⊗AN], which is naturally [A, A]-balanced, i.e.
factors through [A, M]⊗[A,A][A, N] giving rise to (3).

Remark 1.4. Here is a slightly diﬀerent proof of the second statement of proposition 1.3.
The canonical braided equivalence (Morita invariance of the monoidal centre) Z(C) →
Z(ACA) sends the full centre Z(A) to the full centre Z(I) of the monoidal unit I ∈ ACA
(which is really the A-bimodule A).
For a fusion category D (= ACA), the full centre Z(I) ∈ Z(D) coincides with L(I), where
L : D → Z(D) is the adjoint to the forgetful functor F : Z(D) → D. The adjunction
is monadic. Moreover, the monad T = L ◦ F on Z(D) is a Z(D)-module functor. Thus
T -algebras are the same as T (I)-modules. Finally, T (I) = L(I) = Z(I) and the forgetful
functor factorises:

Theorem 1.5. The full centre Z(A) of an indecomposable separable algebra A in a fusion
category C is a Lagrangian algebra in Z(C).

Proof. The tensor equivalence Z(C)Z(A) → ACA from proposition 1.3 induces a braided
tensor equivalence Z(Z(C)Z(A)) → Z(ACA). By Morita invariance of the monoidal centre,
Z(ACA) ≃ Z(C).
By [6, Proposition 3.7], we have the decomposition into Deligne product Z(C)⊠Z(C)loc
Z(Z(C)Z(A)).
Combining the above, we get Z(C)⊠Z(C)loc
i.e. Z(A) is Lagrangian.

Z(A) ≃ Z(C), which means that Z(C)loc

Z(A) ≃ Vect,

Z(A) ≃

2 Commutative algebras in group-theoretical categories

2.1 Group-theoretical braided fusion categories

Let G be a ﬁnite group. By k∗ we denote the multiplicative group of the ground ﬁeld k.
By a 3-cocycle of G with coeﬃcients in k∗, we mean a normalised 3-cocycle of the standard
complex, i.e., a function α : G × G × G → k∗ such that

α(g, h, l)α(f, gh, l)α(f, g, h) = α(f g, h, l)α(f, g, hl),

f, g, h, l ∈ G

and such that α(f, g, h) = 1 each time one of f, g, h is the identity.
We denote by Z 3(G, k∗) the group of normalised 3-cocycles.

A vector space V is G-graded if there given a direct sum decomposition V = ⊕g∈GVg.

The tensor product of graded vector spaces is graded in a natural way (V ⊗U)f = ⊕gh=f Vg⊗Uh.
The monoidal unit in V (G, α) is I = Ie = k. A 3-cocycle α ∈ Z 3(G, k∗) can be used to
twist the standard associativity constraint:

αU,V,W (u ⊗ (v ⊗ w)) = α(f, g, h) (u ⊗ v) ⊗ w,

u ∈ Uf , v ∈ Vg, w ∈ Wh .

(4)



#
Denote by V(G, α) the category of G-graded vector spaces with grading preserving linear
maps, equipped with the above structure of a fusion category,

An α-projective G-action on a G-graded vector space V is a collection of automorphisms

f : V → V,

v 7→ f.v

for each f ∈ G such that f (Vg) = Vf gf −1, and

(f g).v = α(f, g|h)f. (g.v) ,

∀v ∈ Vh.

Here,

α(f, g|h) = α(f, g, h)−1α(f, gh, g)α(f gh, f, g)−1.

where f h = f hf −1. Similarly, deﬁne

α(f |g, h) = α(f, g, h)α(fg, f, h)−1α(f g, f h, f ),

The following identities follow directly from the 3-cocycle condition for normalized α:

α(f, gh|u)α(g, h|u) = α(f g, h|u)α(f, g|huh−1),

α(f g|u, v)α(f, g|u)α(f, g|v) = α(f, g|uv)α(g|u, v)α(f |gug−1, gvg−1),

α(g, h, u)α(f |gh, u)α(f |g, h) = α(f |g, hu)α(f |h, u)α(f gf −1, f hf −1, f uf −1).

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

Deﬁne the category Z(G, α) as follows. Objects of Z(G, α) are G-graded vector spaces
together with α-projective G-action. Morphisms are grading and action-preserving homo-
morphisms of vector spaces.
Deﬁne the tensor product in Z(G, α) is the tensor product of G-graded vector spaces, with
α-projective G-action deﬁned by

f. (x ⊗ y) = α(f |g, h)(cid:0)f.x ⊗ f.y(cid:1),

The associativity is given by (4).
The monoidal unit is I = Ie = k with trivial G-action.
The braiding is given by

x ∈ Xg, y ∈ Yh.

(9)

cX,Y (x ⊗ y) = f.y ⊗ x,

x ∈ Xf , y ∈ Y.

(10)

The following is well-known. We leave the proof to the reader (see also proposition

3.1).

Proposition 2.1. The category Z(G, α) deﬁned above is braided monoidal.

8

Lemma 2.2. The category Z(G, α) is rigid, with dual objects X ∨ = ⊕f (X ∨)f given by

(X ∨)f = (Xf −1)∨ = Homk(Xf −1, k),

with the α-projective action

(g.l)(x) =

α(g−1, g|f −1)
α(g|f, f −1)

l((g−1.x)),

l ∈ Homk(Xf −1, k),

x ∈ Xgf −1g−1 .

Proof. It can be veriﬁed that the formula above indeed deﬁnes an α-projective action on
the graded vector space. The evaluation morphism X ∨⊗X → I is given by the canonical
pairing (X ∨)f ⊗Xf −1 → k. Similarly the coevaluation morphism I → X⊗X ∨ is given by
the canonical elements k → Xf −1⊗(X ∨)f .

Lemma 2.3. The category Z(G, α) admits the following decomposition into a direct sum
of k-linear subcategories:

Z(G, α) = Mf ∈cl(G)

Zf (G, α),

(11)

where the sum is taken over a set cl(G) of representatives of conjugacy classes of elements
of G, and for f ∈ G, the subcategory Zf (G, α) is given by

supp(Z) = f Go .
Here, f G = (cid:8)gf g−1|g ∈ G(cid:9) denotes the conjugacy class of f in G.

Zf (G, α) = nZ ∈ Z(G, α)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Proof. Clearly, the support of an object of Z(G, α) is a union of conjugacy classes in G.
It is also straightforward that for Z ∈ Z(G, α), one has

is a decomposition into a direct sum of objects in Z(G, α).

Z = ⊕c∈cl(G)Zc,

Zc = ⊕f ∈cZf

Lemma 2.4. The category Zf (G, α) is equivalent, as a k-linear category, to the category

k(cid:2)CG (f ) , α ( , |f )−1(cid:3)-Mod of left modules over the twisted group algebra k(cid:2)CG (f ) , α ( , |f )−1(cid:3).

Proof. We show that the functor

F : Zf (G, α) → k(cid:2)CG (f ) , α ( , |f )−1(cid:3) − Mod,

F (Z) = Zf

given by

is an equivalence by exhibiting its quasi-inverse E : k(cid:2)CG (f ) , α ( , |f )−1(cid:3)-Mod → Zf (G, α)
E(M) = na : G → M(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
∀x ∈ G, y ∈ CG (f )o .

a (xy) = α(cid:0)y−1, x−1|xf x−1(cid:1) y−1.a(x)

The G-grading on E(M) is deﬁned as follows: a function a ∈ E(M) is homogeneous if and
only if supp(a) is a single coset modulo CG (f ). More precisely,

|a| = xf x−1 ⇐⇒ supp(a) = xCG(f ).

9

The α-projective G-action on E(M) is given by

(g.a) (x) = α(cid:0)x−1, g|xf x−1(cid:1) a(cid:0)g−1x(cid:1) .

It is straightforward that these deﬁnitions make E(M) into an object of Zf (G, α).
Now we deﬁne the adjunction isomorphisms φ : Id → E ◦ F and ψ : F ◦ E → Id. For
Z ∈ Zf (G, α) and a homogeneous z ∈ Zxf x−1 deﬁne ˜z : G → Zf by

˜z(g) = (cid:26) g−1.z, g ∈ xCG(f )

otherwise

0,

.

It is straightforward to see that ˜z ∈ E (F (Z)).
For an object V ∈ C ({f }, CG(f ), α), deﬁne ψV : F (E(V )) → V by ψV (a) = a(e). One can
verify directly that φ and ψ are morphisms and inverse to one another.

Corollary 2.5. Simple objects Z ∈ Z(G, α) are labelled by conjugacy classes of pairs

(f, M) where f ∈ G and M is a simple k(cid:2)CG (f ) , α ( , |f )−1(cid:3)-module.

Corollary 2.6. Let k be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero. The category Z(G, α) is fusion.

2.2 Algebras in group-theoretical modular categories

We start with expanding the structure of an algebra in the category Z(G, α) in plain
algebraic terms. Recall that a G-graded vector space A = ⊕g∈GAg is a G-graded algebra if
it is equipped with a grading preserving multiplication Af Ag ⊆ Af g. We call a G-graded
algebra A α-associative (for a 3-cocycle α ∈ Z 3(G, k∗)) if

a(bc) = α(f, g, h)(ab)c,

∀a ∈ Af , b ∈ Ag, c ∈ Ah.

Proposition 2.7. An algebra A in the category Z(G, α) is a G-graded α-associative algebra
together with an α-projective G-action such that

f.(ab) = α(f |g, h) (f.a) (f.b) ,

a ∈ Ag, b ∈ Ah.

An algebra A in the category Z(G, α) is commutative iﬀ

ab = (f.b) a,

∀a ∈ Af , b ∈ A.

(12)

(13)

Proof. Being a morphism in the category Z(G, α), the multiplication of an algebra in
Z(G, α) preserves grading and α-projective G-action (hence the property (12)). Associa-
tivity of multiplication in Z(G, α) is equivalent to α-associativity.
The formula (10) for the braiding in Z(G, α) implies that commutativity for an algebra A
in the category Z(G, α) is equivalent to the condition (13).

A G-algebra is an algebra A (in Vect) together with an action of G on A by algebra

homomorphisms.

10

Corollary 2.8. The degree e part Ae of an algebra A in the category Z(G, α) is an as-
sociative G-algebra and A is a module over Ae. The algebra Ae is commutative if A is a
commutative algebra in the category Z(G, α).

Proof. The normalization condition for the cocycle α, together with α-associativity of A,
implies that Ae is an associative algebra and that A is a Ae-module. The same normaliza-
tion condition, together with α-projectivity of the G-action and the property (12), implies
that the action of G on Ae is genuine and that G acts on Ae by algebra homomorphisms.
Commutativity of Ae for a commutative algebra A ∈ Z(G, α) follows directly from the
identity (13).

Proposition 2.9. An algebra A in the category Z(G, α) is separable if and only if the
composition

Af ⊗ Af −1

−→ Ae

µ

τ−→ k

deﬁnes a nondegenerate bilinear pairing for any f ∈ G. In particular, the algebra Ae is
separable if A is a separable algebra in the category Z(G, α).

Proof. Being a homomorphism of graded vector spaces, the standard trace map τ : A → I
is zero on Af for f 6= e. Hence the standard bilinear form is zero on Af ⊗ Ag unless f g = e.
In particular, the restriction of τ to Ae makes it a separable algebra in the category of
vector spaces.

2.3 Etale algebras in trivial degree and their modules

We start with a well known (see for example [10]) description of etale G-algebras in Vect.
We give (a sketch of) the proof for completeness.

Lemma 2.10. Etale G-algebras are function algebras on G-sets.
algebras correspond to transitive G-sets.

Indecomposable G-

Proof. An etale algebra over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k is a function algebra k(X) on
a ﬁnite set X (with elements of X corresponding to minimal idempotents of the algebra).
The G-action on the algebra amounts to a G-action on the set X. Obviously, the algebra
of functions k(X ∪ Y ) on the disjoint union of G-sets is the direct sum of G-algebras
k(X) ⊕ k(Y ) and any direct sum decomposition of G-algebras appears in that way.

Let k(X) be an indecomposable G-algebra. By choosing an element p ∈ X, we can
identify the G-set X with the set G/H of cosets modulo the stabiliser subgroup H = StG(p).
Let C(G, H, α) be the category C(F, G, γ, β, α) with (γ, β, α) = τ (α) as deﬁned in the

appendix.

Theorem 2.11. Let G be a ﬁnite group, and let H ⊂ G be a subgroup. The category
Z(G, α)k(G/H) of right modules over the function algebra k(G/H) in the Drinfeld center
Z(G, α) is equivalent, as a monoidal category, to the category C(G, H, α).
Moreover, the full subcategory Z(G, α)loc
monoidal category, to the Drinfeld center Z(H, α|H).

k(G/H) of local modules is equivalent, as a braided

11

Proof. We will exhibit the claimed equivalence of categories by constructing a pair of
quasi-inverse functors

Z(G, α)k(G/H)

D

E

C(G, H, α)

To deﬁne the ﬁrst functor D, let us choose a minimal idempotent p in the function algebra
k(G/H) to be the indicator function on H:

p : G → k,

p(x) = (cid:26) 1,

x ∈ H

0, otherwise

Deﬁne D : Z(G, α)k(G/H) → C(G, H, α) by D(M) = Mp. Since p is of degree zero, Mp is a
G-graded vector space in a natural way: (Mp)g = (Mg) p. The G-action on M reduces to
an H-action on Mp. This makes D(M) an object of C(G, H, α). Clearly D is a functor. If
M and N are objects of Z(G, α)k(G/H), then

D(cid:0)M ⊗k(G/H) N(cid:1) = (cid:0)M ⊗k(G/H) N(cid:1) p = (cid:0)M ⊗k(G/H) N(cid:1) p2 =

= (Mp) ⊗k(G/H) (Np) = D(M) ⊗ D(N) .

Thus D is a tensor functor.

The second functor E requires more preparation. For V ∈ C(G, H, α) let Map (G, V )

be the vector space of set-theoretic maps G → V . Deﬁne G-grading on Map (G, V ) by

|a| = f ∈ G ⇐⇒ |a(x)| = x−1f x ∀x ∈ G,

(14)

Deﬁne an α-projective G-action on Map (G, V ) as follows. For a homogeneous a ∈ Map (G, V )
of degree |a| = f , deﬁne g.a : G → V by

(g.a) (x) = α(cid:0)x−1, g|f(cid:1)−1 a(cid:0)g−1x(cid:1) .

It is straightforward to check that Map (G, V ) is an object of Z(G, α).
Now consider a subspace of Map (G, V ) given by

E(V ) = {a : G → V | a(xh) = α(h−1, x−1|f )h−1.a(x), h ∈ H, x ∈ G, |a| = f },

(15)

for V ∈ C(G, H, α). It also is not hard to see that E(V ) is an object of Z(G, α).
Moreover E(V ) is a right k(G/H)-module, with the action ν : E(V ) ⊗ E(k) → E(V ) in
Z(G, α) deﬁned by ν (a ⊗ b) = ab, where (ab)(x) = a(x) · b(x) (here we use that E(k) =
k(G/H)). This makes E a functor C (G, H, α) → Z (G, α)k(G/H).
For V, W ∈ C(G, H, α) the universal property of tensor product gives an isomorphism

E(V ) ⊗k(G/H) E(W ) = E(V ) ⊗E(k) E(W ) ≃ E(V ⊗W ),

which shows that E is a monoidal functor.

It remains to deﬁne the adjunction isomorphisms φ : D ◦ E → Id and ψ : Id → E ◦ D.
For V ∈ C(G, H, α), deﬁne a map φV : E(V )p → V by φ (ap) = a(e), where e ∈ G is the
identity element. For M ∈ Z(G, α)k(G/H) deﬁne a map ψM : M → E(Mp) by ψ (m) (x) =
It is a direct task to check that these are natural isomorphisms of

functors.

Finally, we address the locality statement. For an object V ∈ Z(G, α), denote by
supp(V ) = {g ∈ G| Vg 6= 0 } the support of V . Let M be a right k(G/H)-module, and p
be as above. The support of D(M) = Mp is a subset of H. Indeed the locality condition
implies (and is equivalent to the fact) that for m ∈ Mg one has mp = m(g.p). Hence
mp = mp2 = m((g.p)p), which for non-zero m implies that g.p = p. Note that the full
subcategory of C(G, H, α) of objects with support in H is C(H, H, α) = Z(H, α|H). Thus
the restriction of D to Z(G, α)loc
k(G/H) lands in Z(H, α|H). It is straightforward to see that
this restriction is braided.

Remark 2.12. Applied to (etale) algebras, the functor E from the proof of theorem 2.11
is transfer, deﬁned in [14]. The transfer turns an etale algebra from Z (H, α|H) into an
algebra from Z(G, α). Indeed, by theorem 2.11 for an etale algebra B from Z (H, α|H) the
transfer E(B) is an etale algebra in Z(G, α)loc
k(G/H), which by lemma 1.2 is an etale algebra
in Z(G, α) containing k(G/H).

Corollary 2.13. For a simple separable algebra A in Z(G, α), there is a subgroup H ⊂ G
such that A ≃ E(B), where B is a simple separable algebra in Z (H, α|H) with Be = k.

Proof. The subalgebra Ae is an indecomposable commutative G-algebra. By lemma 2.10,
it is isomorphic to k(X) for some transitive G-set X. By lemma 1.2, A is a commutative
algebra in Z(G, α)loc
Ae. Thus, by theorem 2.11, A is the transfer of the etale algebra B = Ap
from Z (H, α|H) (here p is the minimal idempotent of Ae, corresponding to an element of
X, with the stabilizer H = StG(p)). Finally, Be = Aep = k by minimality of p.

2.4 Etale algebras trivial in trivial degree

Here we describe simple etale algebras B in Z (H, β) with Be = k.

Lemma 2.14. Let B be a separable algebra in Z (H, α|H) such that Be = k. Then

Moreover, the support F of B is a normal subgroup of H.

dim (Bh) ≤ 1,

∀h ∈ H.

Proof. By proposition 2.9, an algebra B, such that Be = k, is separable iﬀ the multiplica-
tion deﬁnes the non-degenerate pairing m : Bg ⊗ Bg−1 → Ae = k. Thus, α-associativity of
multiplication implies that, for any a, c ∈ Bg and b ∈ Bg−1

α(g, g−1, g)m(a, b)c = am(b, c).

13

For non-zero a, c, choosing b such that m(a, b), m(b, c) 6= 0, we get that a and c are
proportional.
Now, it follows from the non-degeneracy of m : Bg ⊗ Bg−1 → Ae = k, that a generator of a
non zero Bf is invertible. Thus, for non-zero components Bf , Bg the product Bf Bg is also
non-zero.

Let F ⊳ H be a normal subgroup and γ ∈ C 2(F, k∗) be a cochain, such that d(γ) = α|F .
Denote by k[F, γ] an H-graded α-associative algebra with the basis ef , f ∈ F , graded as
|ef | = f , and with multiplication deﬁned by ef eg = γ(f, g)ef g.

Proposition 2.15. An indecomposable separable algebra B in Z(H, α|H) with Be = k has
the form k[F, γ] with the α-projective H-action given by:

for some ε : H × F → k∗ satisfying

h(ef ) = εh(f )ehf h−1,

εgh(f ) = εg(hf h−1)εh(f )α(f |g, h),

g, h ∈ H, f ∈ F

γ(f, g)εh(f g) = α(f, g|h)εh(f )εh(g)γ(hf h−1hgh−1),

h ∈ H, f, g ∈ F

The algebra k[F, γ] is commutative (and hence etale) if

γ(f, g) = εf (g)γ(f gf −1, f ),

f, g ∈ F.

(16)

(17)

(18)

Proof. Indeed, α-projectivity of the action requires that (gh)(ef ) = εgh(f )eghf h−1g−1 coin-
cides with

α(f |g, h)g(h(ef)) = α(f |g, h)εh(f )εg(hf h−1eghf h−1g−1,

which gives the ﬁrst identity. Multiplicativity of the action amounts to the equality between

h(ef eg) = γ(f, g)εh(f g)ehf gh−1

and

α(f, g|h)h(ef )h(eg) = α(f, g|h)εh(f )εh(g)γ(hf h−1, hgh−1)ehf gh−1,

which gives the second identity. Finally, commutativity implies that ef eg = γ(f, g)ef g is
equal to

f (eg)ef = εf (g)ef gf −1ef = εf (g)γ(f gf −1, f )ef g.

Denote by k[F, γ, ε] the etale algebra in Z(H, α|H), deﬁned in proposition 2.15.

Lemma 2.16. Two algebras k[F, γ, ε] and k[F ′, γ′, ε′] in the category Z(H, α|H) are iso-
morphic iﬀ there is a cochain c : F → k∗ such that

c(f g)γ(f, g) = γ′(f, g)c(f )c(g),

εh(f )c(hf h−1) = c(f )ε′

h(g).

(19)

14

Proof. Isomorphic algebras in Z(H, α|H) have to have the same supports. Thus F =
F ′. Since the components of both k[F, γ, ε] and k[F ′, γ′, ε′] are all one dimensional, an
isomorphism k[F, γ, ε] → k[F ′, γ′, ε′] has a form ef 7→ c(f )ef for some c(f ) ∈ k∗. Finally,
multiplicativity of this mapping is equivalent to the ﬁrst condition, while H-equivariance
is equivalent to the second.

Note that ε can be considered as an element of C 1(H, C 1(F, k∗)), while γ lies naturally
in C 2(F, k∗) = C 0(H, C 2(F, k∗)). Thus, in the terminology of the appendix, (ε, γ) is a 2-
cochain of ˜C ∗(H, F, k∗). The equations (16),(17), together with the condition d(γ) = α|F ,
are equivalent to the coboundary condition d(ε, γ) = (α2, α1, α0) = τ (α) in ˜C ∗(H, F, k∗).
The equations (19) say that (ε, γ) = d(c)(ε′, γ′) for c ∈ C 1(F, k∗) = ˜C 1(H, F, k∗).

Before we describe local modules over the algebras, deﬁned in proposition 2.15, we
need to explain how the cochains γ, ε, associated with them, allow to reduce the cocycle
α ∈ Z 3(H, k∗) to α ∈ Z 3(H/F, k∗). It will be shown, in the course of the proof of theorem
2.17, that α(x, y, z) deﬁned by

α(s(x), s(y), s(y)−1s(x)−1s(xyz))γ(τ (y, z), τ (x, yz)))γ(τ (y, z)τ (x, yz), τ ′(x, y, z))×

× εs(xyz)−1s(x)s(y)(τ (x, y))γ(τ ′(x, y, z)−1, τ ′(x, y, z))

(20)

is a 3-cocycle of H/F . Here s : H/F → H is a section of the quotient map H → H/F ,
τ (y, z) = s(z)−1s(y)−1s(yz) ∈ F and

τ ′(x, y, z) = s(xyz)−1s(x)s(y)τ (x, y)−1s(y)−1s(x)−1s(xyz).

Theorem 2.17. The category Z(H, α|H)loc
is equivalent, as a ribbon category, to
Z(H/F, α).

k[F,γ,ε], of local right k[F, γ, ε]-modules in Z(H, α|H),

Proof. The structure of a right k[F, γ, ε]-module on an object M = ⊕h∈HMh of Z(H, α|H)
amounts to a collection of isomorphisms ef : Mh → Mhf (right multiplication by ef ∈
k[F, γ, ε]) such that

ee = I,

ef ef ′ = γ(f, f ′)ef ′f ,

hef h−1 = εh(f )ehf h−1,

f, f ′ ∈ F, h ∈ H.

Here h : Mh′ → Mhh′h−1 is the α-projective H-action on M. The k[F, γ, ε]-module M
is local iﬀ ef = εh(f )hf h−1ehf h−1 on Mh.
Indeed, the double braiding in Z(H, α|H)
transforms an element m ⊗ ef ∈ M ⊗ A (with m ∈ Mh) as follows

m ⊗ ef 7→ h(ef ) ⊗ m = εh(f )ehf h−1 ⊗ m 7→ εh(f )hf h−1(m) ⊗ ehf h−1.

An equivalent way of expressing the locality condition is the following:

f = εh(h−1f h)−1γ(h−1f h, f −1)γ(f, f −1)−1eh−1f hf −1 = εh(f )e[h−1,f ].

Now let s : H/F → H be a section of the quotient map H → H/F . For a k[F, γ, ε]-module

15

M deﬁne a H/F -graded vector space V by Vx = Ms(x), where x ∈ H/F . For local M
the vector space V can be equipped with a projective H/F -action: for y ∈ H/F deﬁne
y : Vx → Vyxy−1 as the composition

Vx = Ms(x)

s(y)

/ Ms(y)s(x)s(y)−1

ef (x,y)

/ Ms(yxy−1) = Vyxy−1,

where

f (x, y) = s(y)s(x)−1s(y)−1s(yxy−1) = s(y)s(x)−1s(yx) ∈ F.

To compute the projective multiplier one would need to compare zy on Vx with the com-
position of y and z. This can be done with the help of the following diagram:

The cells of the diagram commute up to multiplication by a scalar (except two top and one
bottom cells, which commute on the nose). Carefully gathering the scalars one can write
down the multiplier for the projective H/F -action on V . Fortunately, we do not have to
do it. In view of the proposition 4.9 from the appendix, it is enough to know that such a
multiplier exists.

has been unimportant, but it will become crucial in what we are going to do later. To
calculate this factor, we start with the identity

meu ⊗ n = εh−1(u)(m ⊗ neh−1uh),

which follows from the deﬁnition of the tensor product over B. Multiplying this identity
with eh−1u−1h (from the right) we get

that it is scalar on Vx ⊗ (Uy ⊗ Wz). Once again we apply diagrammatic technique:

Now, composing the arrows of the top cell and comparing the coeﬃcients gives the formula
(20). Finally, by proposition 4.9 from the Appendix, the category Z(H, α|H)loc
k[F,γ,ε] is ribbon
equivalent to Z(H/F, α).

Corollary 2.18. An etale algebra B = k [F, γ, ε] in the category Z(H, α|H) is Lagrangian
if and only if F = H.

Proof. By theorem 2.17, an etale algebra B = k [F, γ, ε] in Z(H, α|H) is Lagrangian if and
only if Z (H/F, α) ≃ k-Vect, i.e. if and only if the quotient group H/F is trivial.

Note that for F = H, ε is determined by γ by the equation (18).

2.5 Etale algebras and their local modules

In this section we combine the previous results on etale algebras in group-theoretical mod-
ular categories and on their local modules.

Deﬁne

A(H, F, γ, ε) = E(k[F, γ, ε]) ,

(21)

where E : Z(H, α|H) → Z(G, α)k(G/H) is the functor from the proof of theorem 2.11.

Theorem 2.19. An etale algebra in Z(G, α) has the form A(H, F, γ, ε), where H ⊂ G is
a subgroup, F E H is a normal subgroup, γ ∈ C 2(F, k∗) is a coboundary d(γ) = α|F and
ε : H × F → k∗ satisﬁes the conditions (16,17,18).

Proof. Follows from corollary 2.13 and lemma 1.2.

Theorem 2.20. The category Z(G, α)loc
Z(G, α), is equivalent, as a ribbon category, to Z (H/F, α).

A(H,F,γ,ε), of local right A(H, F, γ, ε)-modules in

Proof. Follows from theorems 2.11 and 2.17, and lemma 1.2.

Note that when F = H the function ε is completely determined by γ. Indeed, by the

commutativity condition (18) , one has

εf (g) =

γ (f, g)

γ (f gf −1, f )

.

(22)

Denote A(H, H, γ, ε) by L (H, γ). Theorems 2.19 and 2.20 allow us to describe Lagrangian
algebras in group-theoretical modular categories in purely group-theoretical terms.

19

Corollary 2.21. A Lagrangian algebra L ∈ Z(G, α) has the form L(H, γ), where H ⊂ G
is a subgroup and γ ∈ C 2(H, k∗) is a coboundary d(γ) = α|H.

Proof. Follows from corollary 2.18 and theorems 2.19 and 2.20.

Remark 2.22. A Lagrangian algebra L = L (H, γ) is completely characterised by the
conditions

Le ≃ k(G/H),

D(L) = k [H, γ] ∈ C(G, H, α).

Here D : Z(G, α)k(G/H) → C (G, H, α) is the functor from the proof of theorem 2.11.

Remark 2.23. It follows from the corollary 2.21 that Lagrangian algebras in Z(G, α) ⊠
Z(G, α−1) ≃ Z(G × G, α × α−1) correspond to pairs (U, γ), where U ⊂ G × G is a subgroup
and γ ∈ C 2(U, k∗) is a coboundary d(γ) = (α × α−1)|U . This coincides with the parametri-
sation of module categories obtained in [11], which illustrates the fact that the total centre
deﬁnes a bijection between equivalence classes of indecomposable module categories over
Z(G, α) and Lagrangian algebras in Z(G, α) ⊠ Z(G, α−1).

3 Full centre

Here we show that Lagrangian algebras in Z(G, α) are full centres of separable indecom-
posable algebras in V(G, α).

3.1 Monoidal centre of V(G, α)

Denote by V(G, α) the category of G-graded vector spaces with the ordinary tensor product:

(V ⊗ U)g = Mf h=g

Vf ⊗ Uh

and the associativity constraint φV,U,W : V ⊗ (U ⊗ W ) → (V ⊗ U) ⊗ W , twisted by a
3-cocycle α ∈ Z 3(G, k∗):

φV,U,W (v ⊗ (u ⊗ w)) = α(f, g, h)(v ⊗ u) ⊗ w,

∀v ∈ Vf , u ∈ Ug, w ∈ Wh.

Clearly, V(G, α) is a fusion category with the set of simple objects Irr (V(G, α)) = G. We
denote by I(g) the simple object corresponding to g ∈ G: the one dimensional graded
vector space concentrated in degree g.

Here we describe the monoidal centre of V(G, α).

Proposition 3.1. The monoidal centre Z(V(G, α)) is isomorphic, as braided monoidal
category, to the category Z(G, α).
The canonical forgetful functor Z(V(G, α)) → V(G, α) corresponds to the functor Z(G, α) →
V(G, α) forgetting the G-action.

20

Proof. For an object (X, x) of the centre Z(V(G, α)), the natural isomorphism

xV : V ⊗ X → X ⊗ V,

V ∈ V(G, α)

is deﬁned by its evaluations on one-dimensional graded vector spaces. The isomorphism
xI(f ) can be seen as an automorphism f : X → X. The fact, that xI(f ) preserves grading,
amounts to the condition f (Xg) = Xf gf −1:

Xg = (I(f ) ⊗ X)f g

xI(f )

/ (X ⊗ I(f ))f g = Xf gf −1 .

The coherence condition for x is equivalent to the the equation (5), with the associativity
constraints giving rise to α(h|f, g). The diagram, deﬁning the second component x|y of
the tensor product (X, x) ⊗ (Y, y) = (X ⊗ Y, x|y), is equivalent to the tensor product of
projective actions (9), with the associativity constraints giving rise to α(g, h|f ).
The description of the monoidal unit in a monoidal centre corresponds to the answer for
the monoidal unit in Z(G, α).
Clearly, the braiding c(X,x),(Y,y) = yX of the monoidal centre Z(V(G, α)) corresponds to the
braiding (10) of Z(G, α).

3.2 Full centre

Here we identify Lagrangian algebras in Z(G, α) with full centres of separable indecompos-
able algebras in V(G, α). Recall that any such algebra is isomorphic to the twisted group
algebra k[H, γ] for a subgroup H ⊂ G and a coboundary d(γ) = α|H.

Theorem 3.2. The full centre Z(k[H, γ]) coincides with L(H, γ).

Proof. It suﬃces to construct a homomorphism of algebras ζ : L(H, γ) → k[H, γ] in V(G, α)
ﬁtting in the diagram (2). Indeed, such a homomorphism induces a homomorphism of alge-
bras ˜ζ : L(H, γ) → Z(k[H, γ]) in Z(G, α). Since L(H, γ) is separable and indecomposable
in Z(G, α), by lemma 1.1, ˜ζ is a monomorphism. Finally, the dimension of Z(G, α) is |G|,
which coincides with the dimension of the full centre Z(k[H, γ]).
Let us deﬁne a map ζ : E (k [H, γ]) → k [H, γ] by ζ (a) = a(e). Observe that this deﬁnition,
eﬀectively, implies that ζ(a) = 0 if |a| ∈ G \ H. We claim that ζ is a homomorphism of
algebras in the category V (G, α). As ζ is an evaluation map, it is automatically multiplica-
tive. It remains to check that ζ is G-graded. Recall from the proof of theorem 2.11 that for
a homogeneous a ∈ E (k [H, γ]) the degree of the values are |a(x)| = x−1|a|x
∀x ∈ G .
Thus |ζ(a)| = |a(e)| = |a| .
Now we consider the diagram (2). Here, A = k [H, γ] and Z = L (H, γ), so that the

21

k [H, γ]

Let a ∈ L (H, γ), and let eh ∈ k [H, γ] for some h ∈ H. Going the short way, we obtain

eh ⊗ a 7→ eh ⊗ a(e) 7→ eha(e).

Going the long way, we obtain

eh ⊗ a 7→ (h.a) ⊗ eh 7→ ((h.a) (e)) ⊗ eh 7→ ((h.a) (e)) eh.

By H-equivariance of a, the last expression is

((h.a) (e)) eh = a(cid:0)h−1(cid:1) eh = (cid:16)h. (a(e))(cid:17)eh

Finally, since the H-action on k [H, γ] is inner, one has

(cid:16)h. (a(e))(cid:17)eh = eha(e)e−1

h eh .

4 Characters of Lagrangian algebras

4.1 Characters

Here we recall basic facts about characters of objects of Z(G, α).
For an object Z ∈ Z(G, α), deﬁne its character as the function on pairs of commuting
elements of G deﬁned by

Lemma 4.1. The character χZ of Z ∈ Z(G, α) satisﬁes

χZ(f, g) = TrZf (g).

χZ (cid:0)xf x−1, xgx−1(cid:1) =

α (x, g|f )

α (xgx−1, x|f )

χZ (f, g) .

Proof. Let ρ : G → Aut (Z) be the homomorphism corresponding to the action of G on
the vector space Z. Note that by (5) we can write

ρ(x)ρ(g)ρ(x)−1 =

α (xgx−1, x|f )

α (x, g|f )

ρ(cid:0)xgx−1(cid:1) ,

Indeed, ρ(x)ρ(g) = α (x, g|f )−1 ρ(xg) together with ρ(cid:0)xgx−1(cid:1) ρ (x) = α(cid:0)xgx−1, x|f(cid:1)−1 ρ(xg)

give the desired.

Finally

=

α (xgx−1, x|f )

α (x, g|f )

χZ (f, g) = TrZf (ρ(g)) = TrZxf x−1 (cid:0)ρ(x)ρ(g)ρ(x)−1(cid:1) =

α (xgx−1, x|f )

TrZxf x−1 (cid:0)ρ(cid:0)xgx−1(cid:1)(cid:1) =

α (x, g|f )

χZ (cid:0)xf x−1, xgx−1(cid:1) .

By a character of Z(G, α), we will mean a function on pairs of commuting elements of

G satisfying the projective class function property (23).

Remark 4.2. Equation (23) implies that a character of Z(G, α) can be non-zero only on
those commuting pairs (f, g) for which

α(x, f, g)α(g, x, f )α(f, g, x)
α(x, g, f )α(f, x, g)α(g, f, x)

= 1

for any x from the centraliser CG(f, g).

For characters χ and ξ of Z(G, α), deﬁne their product by

(χξ) (f, g) = Xf1f2=f

fig=gfi

α (g|f1, f2) χ (f1, g) ξ (f2, g).

It can be checked that the product of characters is a character.

Lemma 4.3. Let Z, W ∈ Z(G, α), then

χZχW = χZ⊗W .

Proof. Write

Using (9), we get

χZ⊗W (f, g) = Tr(Z⊗W )f (g) = Xf1f2=f

fig=gfi

23

Remark 4.4. Using lemma 2.2, one ﬁnds that the character of the dual object (the dual
character) has the form

χZ ∨(f, g) =

α(g−1, g|f −1)
α(g|f, f −1)

χZ(f −1, g−1).

Deﬁne the scalar product of characters of Z(G, α) (see [1]):

(χ, ψ) =

1

|G| Xf,g∈G,

f g=gf

α(g−1, g|f )χ(f, g−1)ψ(f, g),

The scalar product calculates dimensions of corresponding Hom-spaces in Z(G, α).

Lemma 4.5. Let Z, W ∈ Z(G, α). Then

(χZ, χW ) = dim (Z(G, α)(Z, W )) .

Proof. Note ﬁrst that the Hom-space Z(G, α)(I, W ) coincides with the vector space of
G-invariants W G

e , so that

dim (Z(G, α)(I, W )) = dimk(W G

e ) =

1

|G| Xg

χW (e, g) .

In the general case, Z(G, α)(Z, W ) ≃ Z(G, α)(I, Z ∨⊗W ), and

dim (Z(G, α)(Z, W )) = dim (Z(G, α)(I, Z ∨⊗W )) =

1

|G| Xg

χZ ∨⊗W (e, g) =

=

|G| Xf,g∈G,

f g=gf

α(g|f −1, f )χZ ∨(f −1, g)χW (f, g) =

α(g|f −1, f )

α(g−1, g|f −1)

=

1

|G| Xf,g∈G,

f g=gf

α(g−1, g|f )χZ(f, g−1)χW (f, g) .

In particular, for simple Z, W ∈ Z(G, α) the scalar product (χZ, χW ) = 1 iﬀ Z ≃ W

and zero otherwise.

4.2 Characters of Lagrangian algebras

Here we compute the characters of Lagrangian algebras in Z(G, α).
Recall from the proof of theorem 2.11 the functor E : Z(H, α|H) → Z(G, α) given by (15).

24

Lemma 4.6. For V ∈ Z(H, α|H), the character χE(V ) has the form

χE(V ) (f, g) = Xy∈Y

α (y−1gy, y−1|f )

α (y−1, g|f )

χV (cid:0)y−1f y, y−1gy(cid:1),

f, g ∈ G,

(24)

where Y is a set of representatives in G of the cosets from

{y ∈ G| y−1f y ∈ H, y−1gy ∈ H}/H ⊂ G/H .

Proof. Let V ∈ Z (H, α|H).
It follows from the deﬁning condition that functions from
E(V ) are supported by unions of right H-cosets of G. Clearly, any function from E(V )
is (a unique) sum of functions, each of which is supported on a single coset. For a coset
yH, a function a ∈ E(V ) with the support supp(a) = yH is uniquely determined by its
value a(y) = v ∈ V . Denote such a function by ay,v. The space E(V ) is spanned by ay,v
for y ∈ G and v ∈ V .
By (14) the degree of ay,v is f iﬀ v ∈ Vy−1f y. Note that for v ∈ Vh−1y−1f yh one has

α(h−1, y−1|f )α(h, h−1|y−1f y)ayh,v = ay,h.v,

h ∈ H .

Indeed, v = ayh,v(yh) = α(h−1, y−1|f )h−1.ayh,v(y) gives

ay,h.v(y) = h.v = α(h−1, y−1|f )α(h, h−1|y−1f y)ayh,v(y) .

Thus we can write

E(V )f = My

hay,v| v ∈ Vy−1f yi ≃ My

Vy−1f y,

(25)

where the sum is taken over representatives of the cosets G/H.

For g ∈ CG (f ), consider the linear operator g : E(V )f → E(V )f . Recall (from the

proof of theorem 2.11) that the action of g on E(V ) is given by

(g.a)(x) = α(x−1, g|f )−1a(g−1x),

x ∈ G, a ∈ E(V )f .

In particular supp(g.a) = g supp(a). Thus g.ay,v is supported by the coset gyH and hence
can be written as agy,v′ for some v′ ∈ V . We can say that the action of g on E(V )f per-
mutes the direct summands of (25) according to the left action of g on the cosets G/H.

Thus the trace TrE(V )f (g) is a sum Xy
tatives of those cosets yH for which gyH = yH. Let now y ∈ G be such that gyH = yH
(or equivalently y−1gy ∈ H). To compute the trace Trhay,v| v∈Vy−1f yi(g) note that g.ay,v
(with v ∈ Vy−1f y) can be written as ay,v′ for some v′ ∈ V . More explicitly

Trhay,v| v∈Vy−1f yi(g), where y runs through represen-

v′ = g.ay,v(y) = α(y−1, g|f )−1ay,v(g−1y) = α(y−1, g|f )−1ay,v(yy−1g−1y) =

=

α(y−1gy, y−1|f )

α(y−1, g|f )

(y−1gy).ay,v(y) =

α(y−1gy, y−1|f )

α(y−1, g|f )

(y−1gy).v .

25

Thus the trace Trhay,v| v∈Vy−1f yi(g) coincides with
Finally

α(y−1gy, y−1|f )

α(y−1, g|f )

TrVy−1f y

(y−1gy).

χE(V ) (f, g) = TrE(V )f (g) = Xy∈Y

TrVy−1f y

(y−1gy) =

α(y−1gy, y−1|f )

α(y−1, g|f )

α (y−1gy, y−1|f )

α (y−1, g|f )

= Xy∈Y

χV (cid:0)y−1f y, y−1gy(cid:1) .

Lemma 4.7. Let γ ∈ C 2(H, k∗) be a coboundary for α|H. The Z(H, α|H) character χk[H,γ]
of the twisted group algebra k[H, γ] is given by

χk[H,γ](h, u) =

γ(u, h)
γ(h, u)

.

Proof. For any h ∈ H, the degree-h component k [H, γ]h is one-dimensional and has the
form

According to (22)

k [H, γ]h = keh .

u.eh =

γ (u, h)

γ (uhu−1, u)

euhu−1,

u ∈ H .

For u ∈ CH (h), this becomes

u.eh =

γ (u, h)
γ (h, u)

eh .

Now we are ready to prove the main result of this section.

Theorem 4.8. Let L = L (H, γ) be a Lagrangian algebra in Z(G, α). Then the character
χL has the form

χL (f, g) = Xy∈Y

α (y−1gy, y−1|f ) γ (y−1f y, y−1gy)

α (y−1, g|f ) γ (y1gy, y−1f y)

,

f, g ∈ G,

(26)

where Y is a set of representatives in G of the cosets from

{y ∈ G| y−1f y ∈ H, y−1gy ∈ H}/H ⊂ G/H .

Proof. Follows from lemmas 4.6 and 4.7.

4.3 Example: Z(D3, α)
Here D3 is the dihedral group of order 6: D3 = hr, s| r3 = s2 = e; srs = r−1 i.
It is known that the third cohomology group H 3(D3, C∗) is cyclic of order 6 (see e.g.
[2,
section 6.3]). More explicitly, the cohomology group H 3 (D3, C∗) is generated by the class
of the 3-cocycle θ given by

θ (sm1rn1, sm2rn2, sm3rn3) =

= exp(cid:18) 2πi

9 (cid:18)(−1)m2+m3n1(cid:16)(−1)m3n2 + n3 − [(−1)m3n2 + n3]3(cid:17) +

9
2

m1m2m3(cid:19)(cid:19) ,

where [

]3 denotes taking the residue modulo 3.

Recall that the second cohomology group H 2(D3, C∗) is trivial. This implies that a
coboundary for the restriction α|H of a 3-cocycle α ∈ Z 3(D3, C∗) to a subgroup H ⊂ G
is unique if exists. Thus Lagrangian algebras in Z(D3, α) are labelled just by (conjugacy
classes of) subgroups on which the restriction of α is cohomologically trivial (admissible
subgroups).

In terms of the cocycle α, there are four distinct cases, depending on the order of the

class of α in H 3(D3, C∗).

Deﬁne a tensor product in the category C(F, G, γ) by

(U ⊗ V )z = ⊕xy=zUx ⊗ Vy,

with the F -action

f (u ⊗ v) = β(f |x, y)f (u) ⊗ f (v).

The condition (28) implies that this action is γ-projective.

Finally, a normalised function α : G × G × G → k∗, satisfying

α(x, y, z)β(f |xy, z)β(f |x, y) = β(f |x, yz)β(f |y, z)α(f (x), f (y), f (z))

(29)

and a 3-cocycle condition

α(y, z, w)α(x, yz, w)α(x, y, z) = α(x, y, zw)α(xy, z, w).

(30)

Then the map α : U ⊗ (V ⊗ W ) → (U ⊗ V ) ⊗ W

u ⊗ (v ⊗ w) 7→ α(x, y, z)(u ⊗ v) ⊗ w,

u ∈ Ux, v ∈ Vy, w ∈ Wz

is a morphism in the category C(F, G, γ) (with condition (29 implying its F -equivariance),
satisfying the pentagon axiom (by condition (30)).
We denote by C(F, G, γ, β, α) the category C(F, G, γ) with the monoidal structure deﬁned
by β and α.

Representation categories and categories of graded vector spaces ﬁt in the series of cat-
egories C(F, G, γ, β, α) as extreme cases, with (categories of modules in) group-theoretical
modular categories appearing as intermediate examples. Indeed, for G = {e}, γ = β =
α = 1, the category C(F, G, γ, β, α) is the category Rep(G) of representations of G. If
F = {e}, γ = β = 1, C(F, G, γ, β, α) is the monoidal category C(G, α) of G-graded vector
spaces with the associator given by α. For F = G with conjugation action and with γ and

30

β deﬁned by (7) and (6), the category C(F, G, γ, β, α) coincides with Z(G, α). Finally, for
H being a subgroup of G again with conjugation action and with γ and β deﬁned by (7)
and (6), the category C(H, G, γ, β, α) coincides with the category Z(G, α)k(G/H) of modules
of the algebra k(G/H) in Z(G, α).

To compare diﬀerent categories of the form C(F, G, γ, β, α) we introduce certain monoidal
equivalences between them, which we call for short gauge equivalences. Let C(F, G, γ, β, α)
and C(F, G, γ′, β′, α′) be two (monoidal) categories. Let b : F × G → k∗ be a normalised
fuction, satisfying

(31)
Deﬁne a functor T (b) : C(F, G, γ) → C(F, G, γ′), which preserves the G-grading on an
object V and modiﬁes the F -action:

b(f g|x)γ(f, g|x) = γ′(f, g|x)b(f |x)b(f |g(x)).

˜f (v) = b(f |x)f (v),

v ∈ Vx.

The condition (31) implies that the new action is γ′-projective. Now let a : G × G → k∗
be a normalised function such that

b(f |xy)a(x, y)β(f |x, y) = β′(f |x, y)b(f |x)b(f |y)a(f (x), f (y)),

α(x, y, z)a(x, y)a(xy, z) = a(y, z)a(x, yz)α′(x, y, z).

(32)

(33)

Deﬁne a monoidal structure on the functor T (b):

u ⊗ v 7→ b(x, y)u ⊗ v,

u ∈ Ux, v ∈ Vy.

The condition (32) implies that this map is F -equivariant, while (33) is equivalent to the
coherence axiom for a monoidal functor. Denote the resulting monoidal equivalence by
T (b, a) : C(F, G, γ, β, α) → C(F, G, γ′, β′, α′).

To describe gauge equivalence classes of categories C(F, G, γ, β, α) consider a double
complex C p,q(F, G, k∗) = C p(F, C q(G, k∗)). Elements of C p,q(F, G, k∗) are normalised func-
tions

c : F ×p × G×q → k∗,

(f1, ..., fp, g1, ..., gq) 7→ c(f1, ..., fp|g1, ..., gq).

The vertical diﬀerential ∂ : C p,q → C p,q+1 is induced by the standard diﬀerential C q(G, k∗) →
C q+1(G, k∗):

∂(c)(f1, ..., fp|g1, ..., gq+1) =

c(f1, ..., fp|g2, ..., gq+1)(

q

Yi=1

c(f1, ..., fp|g1, ..., gigi+1, ..., gq)(−1)i

)c(f1, ..., fp|g1, ..., gq)(−1)q+1

.

The horizontal diﬀerential d : C p,q → C p,q+1 is the standarad diﬀerential itself:

d(c)(f1, ..., fp+1|g1, ..., gq) =

c(f2, ..., fp+1|g1, ..., gq)(

p

Yi=1

c(f1, ..., , fifi+1, ..., fp|g1, ...gq)(−1)i

)c(f1, ..., fp|fp(g1), ..., fp(gq))(−1)p+1

.

31

The conditions (27)-(30) can be rewritten as

d(γ) = 1,

∂(γ) = d(β),

∂(β) = d(α),

∂(α) = 1.

In other words, the collection (γ, β, α) is a 3-cocycle of the truncated total complex
˜C n(F, G, k∗) = ⊕n−1

p=0 C p,n−p(F, G, k∗). The conditions (31)-33) say that

γ′d(b) = γ,

β′d(a) = β∂(b),

α′∂(a) = α.

Hence (b, c) is a 2-coboundary in ˜C ∗ for the collection (γ, β, α)(γ′, β′, α′)−1. Thus gauge
equivalence classes of categories of the form V(F, G, γ, β, α) correspond to 3-cohomology
classes of ˜C ∗. Note that ˜C ∗ is a direct summand of the (untruncated) total complex
C n = ⊕n
p=0C p,n−p, which is quasi-isomorphic to the standard complex C ∗(F ⋉ G, k∗) of the
crossed product of groups F ⋉ G [9]. Since the kernel of the projection C ∗ → ˜C ∗ coincides
with C ∗(F, k∗) we have an isomorphism

H n( ˜C) ⊕ H n(F, k∗) ≃ H n(F ⋉ G, k∗).

In particular, when F = G, acting on itself by conjugation, the crossed product of groups
G ⋉ G is isomorphic to the product G × G. In this case the cohomology of C ∗ and ˜C ∗ are

H n(C) = ⊕n

p=0H p(G, H n−p(G, k∗)), H n( ˜C) = ⊕n−1

p=0 H p(G, H n−p(G, k∗)).

A cochain map τ : C n(G, k∗) = C 0(G, C n(G, k∗)) → ˜C n giving the splitting in cohomology
H n(G, k∗) = H 0(G, H n(G, k∗)) → H n( ˜C) was constructed in [9] and has the following
form:

n−1

where αp ∈ C p(G, C n−p(G, k∗)) is

τ (α) =

αp,

Xp=0

αp(f1, ..., fp|g1, ..., gn−p) = Yσ

α(x1, ..., xn)(−1)σ

.

Here the product is over all (p, n − p)-shuﬄes and xi = higσ(i)h−1
product Yσ(j)>σ(i)

fj. For example, for α ∈ C 3(G, k∗)

i with hi being the ordered

α1(f |g, h) = α(f, g, h)α(f gf −1, f, h)−1α(f gf −1, f hf −1, f ) = α(f |g, h),

α2(f, g|h) = α(f, g, h)α(f, ghg−1, g)−1α(f ghg−1f −1, ghg−1, g) = α(f, g|h).

Thus the monoidal category Z(G, α) coincides with C(F, G, γ, β, α), where (γ, β, α) = τ (α).
Now we return to the categories C(F, G, γ′, β′, α′). We assume that F = G with the
conjugation action on G. In this case we can ask when the functorial isomorphism, deﬁned
by

cU,V (u ⊗ v) = c(x, y)x(v) ⊗ u,

u ∈ Ux, v ∈ Vy.

(34)

32

is a braiding in C(F, G, γ′, β′, α′). The hexagon axioms are equivalent to the equations

β(x|y, z)c(x, yz) = c(x, y)c(x, z)α(x|y, z),

c(xy, z)γ(z|x, y) = c(y, z)c(x, yzy−1)α(x, y|z).

(35)

(36)

Denote by C(G, G, γ, β, α, c) a braided category C(G, G, γ, β, α) with the braiding (34). A
gauge equivalence T (b, a) : C(F, G, γ, β, α, c) → C(F, G, γ′, β′, α′, c′) is braided iﬀ

b(x, y)c′(x, y)a(x|y) = b(xyx−1, x)c(x, y).

(37)

The equations (35),(36) can be intrerpreted as a coboundary condition d(c) = (γ, β, α)τ (α)−1

(here c is considered as an element of C 1(G, C 1(G, k∗))). Thus, at least at the level of
monoidal categories, any C(G, G, γ, β, α) with braiding of the form (34) is equivalent to
Z(G, α). Note that in the assumption (γ, β, α) = τ (α) the equations (35),(36) turn into
bi-multiplicativity condition for c:

c(x, yz) = c(x, y)c(x, z),

c(xy, z) = c(x, z)c(y, z).

Thus by (37) the guage equivalence T (1, c) is a braided equivalence between C(G, G, γ, β, α, c)
(with (γ, β, α) = τ (α)) and Z(G, α). In particular we have proved the following.

Proposition 4.9. Braided monoidal category of the form C(G, G, γ, β, α, c) is braided
equivalent to Z(G, α).
