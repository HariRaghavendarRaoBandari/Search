ABSTRACT

We present cosmological parameter constraints obtained from galaxy clusters identiﬁed by their
Sunyaev-Zel’dovich eﬀect signature in the 2500 square degree South Pole Telescope Sunyaev Zel’dovich
(SPT-SZ) survey. We consider the 377 cluster candidates identiﬁed at z > 0.25 with a detection
signiﬁcance greater than ﬁve, corresponding to the 95% purity threshold for the survey. We compute
constraints on cosmological models using the measured cluster abundance as a function of mass and
redshift. We include additional constraints from multi-wavelength observations, including Chandra
X-ray data for 82 clusters and a weak lensing-based prior on the normalization of the mass-observable
scaling relations. We introduce a numerical technique to eﬃciently compute the cluster likelihood in
the presence of an arbitrary number of mass proxies, each of which relate to the underlying cluster
mass with a power-law scaling relation and contain scatter, of which a log-normal component may
be correlated between mass proxies. Assuming a spatially ﬂat ΛCDM cosmology, where the species-
summed neutrino mass has the minimum allowed value (Σmν = 0.06 eV) from neutrino oscillation
experiments, we combine the cluster data with a prior on H0 and ﬁnd σ8 = 0.784 ± 0.039 and
Ωm = 0.289 ± 0.042, with the parameter combination σ8 (Ωm/0.27)0.3 = 0.797 ± 0.031. These results
are in good agreement with constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from SPT,
WMAP, and Planck, as well as with constraints from other cluster datasets. Adding the sum of
the neutrino masses as a free parameter, we ﬁnd Σmν = 0.14 ± 0.08 eV when combining the SPT
cluster data with Planck CMB data and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, consistent with
the minimum allowed value. With this dataset, when we simultaneously free Σmν and the eﬀective
number of relativistic species (Neﬀ ), we ﬁnd Neﬀ = 3.28 ± 0.20 and Σmν = 0.18 ± 0.09 eV. Finally,
we consider a cosmology where Σmν and Neﬀ are ﬁxed to the ΛCDM values, but the dark energy
equation of state parameter w is free. Using the SPT cluster data in combination with an H0 prior,
we measure w = −1.28 ± 0.31, a constraint consistent with the ΛCDM cosmological model and
derived from the combination of growth of structure and geometry. When combined with primarily
geometrical constraints from Planck CMB, H0, BAO and SNe, adding the SPT cluster data improves
the w constraint from the geometrical data alone by 14%, to w = −1.023 ± 0.042.

1. INTRODUCTION

Galaxy clusters trace extreme peaks in the matter den-
sity ﬁeld on megaparsec scales. The abundance of these
peaks as a function of mass and redshift is highly sensi-
tive to the matter density and the growth of structure.
As this abundance can be predicted with suﬃcient ac-
curacy for a given cosmology (Tinker et al. 2008; Bhat-
tacharya et al. 2011; Holder & Carlstrom 2001), even
modest measurements of cluster abundance can yield
powerful cosmological constraints. These constraints are

particularly powerful when combined with or compared
to independent constraints from probes such as the power
spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). Taken together,
growth-based and geometrical probes can place signif-
icantly tighter constraints on parameters such as the
equation of state of dark energy than either one inde-
pendently, because of nearly orthogonal parameter de-
generacies. Considered independently, these constraints
provide a consistency test of the dark energy paradigm
and the validity of general relativity (Ishak et al. 2006;
Zhan et al. 2009; Mortonson et al. 2009, 2010; Rapetti
et al. 2009, 2010; Acquaviva & Gawiser 2010; Vanderveld
et al. 2012).

In recent years, constraints on cosmological parameters
from cluster abundance measurements have advanced
signiﬁcantly using cluster samples selected at X-ray (e.g.,
Vikhlinin et al. 2009b; Mantz et al. 2010, 2015), opti-
cal (e.g., Rozo et al. 2010), and millimeter (e.g., Re-
ichardt et al. 2013; Planck Collaboration et al. 2014b;
Hasselﬁeld et al. 2013; Bocquet et al. 2015; Planck Col-
laboration et al. 2015) wavelengths. The predominant
millimeter-wave (mm-wave) signal from clusters arises
from the thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (tSZ) eﬀect (Sun-
yaev & Zel’dovich 1972), i.e., the scattering of CMB pho-
tons by hot electrons in the intra-cluster medium (ICM).
The surface brightness of the tSZ eﬀect is redshift-
independent, allowing high-resolution mm-wave surveys
to obtain nearly mass-limited samples of clusters to arbi-
trarily high redshift. The ability to cleanly select clusters
out to the redshift at which dark energy begins to con-
tribute signiﬁcantly to the energy budget of the universe
(z ∼ 1) is particularly important for constraints on the
dark energy equation of state and tests of the dark en-
ergy paradigm. Cluster surveys using high-resolution tSZ
data are uniquely positioned to deliver such constraints
(Carlstrom et al. 2002).

The primary limitation to cosmological constraints
from current cluster surveys at all wavelengths is an im-
perfect understanding of the relationship between the
quantity that can be predicted from theory or simula-
tions (the cluster mass or the height of the associated
density peak) and the observable property of the clus-
ter that is used as a proxy for this quantity. The mass
proxy can be the observable quantity used to construct
the sample; it can also include observables from follow-
up observations, often at diﬀerent wavelengths than the
cluster selection observable. Since the cluster abundance
is an extremely steep function of mass, misestimation of
the relation between the mass proxy and the true clus-
ter mass can lead to signiﬁcant biases on the resulting
cosmological parameter constraints.

Diﬀerent cluster mass proxies have distinct advantages
and disadvantages related to the accuracy and precision
with which they trace the true cluster mass and the ex-
pense of obtaining the data required to construct them.
In terms of ultimate accuracy, or absence of bias, the
current gold standard mass proxy is derived from mea-
surements of weak gravitational lensing of background
galaxies by clusters (see von der Linden et al. 2014b for
a discussion). Optical mass measurements from weak
gravitational lensing are observationally expensive to ob-
tain at high redshift, and the scatter on individual clus-
ter mass estimates is large. Gravitational lensing of

the CMB by clusters is a promising future avenue for
mass estimation—e.g., Madhavacheril et al. 2015; Bax-
ter et al. 2015; Planck Collaboration et al. 2015. Cluster
velocity dispersions, generally obtained through spectro-
scopic observations of tens of cluster member galaxies,
are also mostly unaﬀected by complex ICM physics but
are expensive observationally and have large scatter (e.g.,
Evrard et al. 2008; Saro et al. 2013; Sif´on et al. 2013; Ruel
et al. 2014), as well as uncertain velocity bias (e.g., Mu-
nari et al. 2013). Where weak lensing measurements pro-
vide high accuracy, measurements of the gas mass Mgas,
and/or of the integrated cluster pressure Y provide high
precision. Estimated from tSZ or X-ray data, integrated
cluster pressure is predicted and measured to track clus-
ter mass with low scatter (e.g., Motl et al. 2005; Nagai
et al. 2007; Stanek et al. 2010; Kravtsov et al. 2006),
but its relation to true cluster mass can be complicated
by non-thermal pressure support in clusters (e.g., Evrard
et al. 1996; Nagai et al. 2007; Yu et al. 2015). Further-
more, robust Y estimates require either relatively high-
quality X-ray data (to provide deprojected temperature
and density proﬁles), or tSZ measurements with accurate
information on all cluster scales (sub-arcminute scales to
the virial radius). Mass proxies built from the same data
used to select clusters, such as optical richness, X-ray
luminosity, and tSZ detection signiﬁcance, come at no
extra cost but can demonstrate high scatter and require
external calibration data to tie them robustly to the true
cluster mass.

In this work, we use a sample of clusters derived from
the SPT-SZ survey, a three-band mm-wave survey of
2500 deg2 of the southern sky conducted with the South
Pole Telescope (SPT, Carlstrom et al. 2011). The clus-
ter selection method, redshift determination, and sam-
ple characteristics are described in detail in Bleem et al.
(2015, hereafter B15). We use the mm-wave and redshift
information from B15 in conjunction with targeted X-ray
follow-up observations from Chandra to obtain cosmolog-
ical constraints. The mass proxy we use is the tSZ de-
tection signiﬁcance ξ, calibrated using X-ray integrated
pressure YX, which is in turn tied to true cluster mass
using optical weak lensing (WL) measurements.
In §2, we brieﬂy
describe the cluster sample, including the mm-wave data
and analysis methods that went into producing the sam-
ple. We summarize the optical/infrared data and red-
shift estimation in §3, and the X-ray data and analy-
sis methods in §4. The cosmological analysis methods
are described in §5, and we present the cosmological pa-
rameter constraints in §6. We compare the cosmological
constraints from this work to those from other cluster
surveys in §7, and we conclude in §8.

The paper is organized as follows.

When parameter constraints are reported, the best-
ﬁt value and uncertainties correspond to the mean and
standard deviation of the posterior distribution. Cluster
masses, denoted with M∆, refer to spherical overdensities
for which the enclosed density is equal to ∆ times the
critical density, ρc. Similarly, r∆ refers to the associated
radius such that M∆ = 4

∆∆ρc(z).

2. SZ DATA AND METHODS

The cluster sample used in this work is a subset of that
previously presented in B15. We choose the clusters with
redshift z > 0.25 and detection signiﬁcance ξ > 5. The

3

signiﬁcance cut was chosen such that the resulting cata-
log has high (∼ 95%) purity, and the redshift cut allows
for a nearly redshift-independent selection function (Van-
derlinde et al. 2010, hereafter V10). Our strategy for
tying the cluster abundance measurement to the cosmo-
logically predicted halo mass function is to calibrate the
SZ-mass scaling relation using Chandra X-ray measure-
ments. The X-ray scaling relation is taken from Vikhlinin
et al. (2009a,b, hereafter V09), though we modify the
overall normalization of this relation in §4.2 to be consis-
tent with more recent weak lensing measurements from
Hoekstra et al. (2015, hereafter H15) and the Weighing
the Giants (WtG) project (Applegate et al. 2014; von der
Linden et al. 2014a; Mantz et al. 2015).

2.1. Sample of SZ Cluster Candidates

The SPT is a 10-m telescope located at the geographic
South Pole. With a 1 degree ﬁeld of view and ∼ 1 arc-
minute resolution, it was designed to rapidly map large
areas of sky while being well matched to the angular size
of high-redshift clusters. The SPT-SZ camera operated
from 2007 through 2011 and consisted of a 960-element,
photon-noise-limited bolometer array observing in three
frequency bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz,
though this work uses only the ﬁrst two bands. The
observation strategy and analysis for the 2500-square-
degree SPT-SZ survey are described in many previous
SPT papers (e.g. Schaﬀer et al. 2011), and the analysis
speciﬁc to obtaining the cluster sample is described in
B15. Brieﬂy, the majority of the 2500 square-degree sur-
vey was performed using the following scan strategy. The
telescope is moved using a right-going scan in azimuth,
followed by a left-going scan, followed by a step in eleva-
tion. This pattern is repeated until a (cid:38) 100 square degree
patch of sky is observed. One such iteration is termed an
observation, whereas the patch of sky is termed a ﬁeld.
In the only exception to this observing strategy, for two
thirds of the data taken on one ﬁeld (ra21hdec-50), the
scan pattern instead consisted of scans in elevation at a
series of ﬁxed azimuth positions. Each ﬁeld was observed
until a depth of (cid:46) 18 µK-arcmin at 150 GHz was reached.
Table 1 lists the 19 ﬁelds that comprise the full survey.
For more information on the properties of the ﬁelds, see
Table 1 of B15.

Two-dimensional maps of the sky are made by bin-
ning the time ordered data (TOD), to which mild time-
domain ﬁltering has been applied, into 0.25-arcminute
pixels. This produces estimates of the 95 and 150 GHz
sky, to which we apply a simultaneous spatial-spectral
ﬁlter, yielding a ﬁltered estimate of the tSZ sky, opti-
mized for extracting cluster candidates. The candidates
are identiﬁed using a peak-ﬁnding algorithm.

Due to the exact choice of ﬁeld extent, as well as the
ﬁnite footprint of the SPT-SZ array on the sky, the ﬁelds
overlap slightly. The overlap regions only comprise ∼ 2%
of the total survey area, and for simplicity we choose to
treat the ﬁelds as fully independent. As a result of this
treatment, we would expect to double-count roughly 2%
of cluster candidates, or seven to eight of our total num-
ber of candidates. In fact we ﬁnd nine cases of candidates
with a very high probability of having been detected in
two diﬀerent ﬁelds (i.e., 18 total candidates that corre-
spond to nine physical clusters). There is no bias to our
cosmological constraints from this treatment. Our uncer-

4

tainties will be very slightly underestimated, but this has
a negligible eﬀect on our ﬁnal cosmological constraints.

2.1.1. SZ-Mass Scaling Relation Parameterization

We use the same functional form for the SZ-mass scal-
ing relation as previous SPT cluster cosmology analyses
(V10; Benson et al. 2013, hereafter B13; Reichardt et al.
2013, hereafter R13; Bocquet et al. 2015).

Brieﬂy, we introduce two SZ parameters related to the
cluster detection process. The ﬁrst is the detection signif-
icance ξ. After generating ﬁltered synthesized SZ maps
at a series of ﬁlter scales, each map pixel value is divided
by the RMS of the map in a strip that spans 90 arcmin-
utes in declination. Then the maximum peak height over
all ﬁlter scales is identiﬁed and deﬁned as ξ, the SZ ob-
servable used in this paper. Because this observable al-
lows for a very well-understood selection function, and
cosmological constraints are dominated by the unknown
normalization of the observable-mass scaling relation, we
ﬁnd that this observable is preferred over going to a dif-
ferent SZ observable such as YSZ.

The second parameter is the unbiased signiﬁcance ζ.
It is deﬁned as the value of ξ that would be found in the
absence of instrumental noise and astrophysical contam-
inants (including the SZ background). Due to the fact
that ξ is determined by maximizing the signiﬁcance after
searching in two-dimensional position space and source
template size, the average ξ found across many noise re-
alizations is enhanced by those three degrees of freedom,
resulting in the approximate relation
(cid:104)ξ(cid:105)2 = ζ 2 + 3.

(1)

Since this relation cannot hold down to very low ζ, we
only model this maximization bias for ζ > 2. We ﬁnd
that changing the location of this cutoﬀ to ζ > 1.5 or ζ >
2.5 has negligible impact on the results presented in this
work. Motivated by the deﬁnition of ξ, and the fact that
the astrophysical contaminants and instrument noise are
Gaussian to a high degree, we model ξ as related to (cid:104)ξ(cid:105)
by unit-width Gaussian scatter. We then parameterize
the ζ - M scaling relation as

(cid:19)BSZ(cid:18) E(z)

(cid:19)CSZ

(cid:18)

ζ = ASZ

M

3 × 1014M(cid:12)h−1

E(0.6)

,

(2)

with an additional log-normal intrinsic scatter parameter
σln ζ. The dimensionless Hubble parameter is denoted by
E(z). We follow B13 and R13 and apply Gaussian pri-
ors to these scaling relation parameters. However, the
mean values and widths of the priors are updated to re-
ﬂect results from the more recent cosmo-OWLS hydro-
dynamic simulations (Le Brun et al. 2014), which will be
discussed in §2.2. Speciﬁcally, we use the Gaussian priors
ASZ = 5.38±1.61, BSZ = 1.340±0.268, CSZ = 0.49±0.49,
and σln ζ = 0.13 ± 0.13, while requiring σln ζ > 0.05.

2.2. By-Field Simulations

Each of the 19 ﬁelds that comprises the 2500 square de-
gree survey has slightly diﬀerent properties, which we ac-
count for using two similar types of simulations. The ﬁrst
is to account for the fact that the map noise is slightly
diﬀerent in each of the ﬁelds. This causes the detection
signiﬁcance ξ (the selection observable) of a cluster to

relate to true underlying mass diﬀerently depending on
the ﬁeld in which the cluster was found. We model this
by simulating the relation between true cluster mass and
unbiased signiﬁcance ζ separately for each ﬁeld. The
simulations contain several components.

1. A Gaussian random ﬁeld with a power spectrum
equal to the CMB power spectrum calculated using
the best-ﬁt ΛCDM parameters from Keisler et al.
(2011).

2. A Gaussian random ﬁeld meant to approximate
the background of emissive point sources after the
brightest sources are masked. The power spectrum
is generated using three components. The ﬁrst
is a Poisson component modeling the radio point
source population with an amplitude at (cid:96) = 3000
2 at 150 GHz and spectral
of Dr
index αr = −0.6 (deﬁned by ﬂux ∝ να). The sec-
ond and third components model the Poisson and
clustered dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) pop-
ulations, respectively. The assumed spectral index
is αDSFG = 3.6 and the amplitudes are the best-ﬁt
values from Shirokoﬀ et al. (2011).

3000 = 1.28µKCMB

3. Atmospheric and instrumental noise. These are
simulated using the actual TOD. The coherent na-
ture of the sky signal, modulated by the scan strat-
egy, and the incoherent nature of the instrumen-
tal and atmospheric noise contributions allow us
to estimate the map noise by simply subtracting
the right-going scan TOD from the left-going scan
TOD (up- and down-going in the case of most of
the ra21hdec-50 ﬁeld) in the map making process.
This removes any coherent signal present on the
sky. We furthermore apply a sign change to half
the observations before they are coadded into the
ﬁnal map. By changing which signs are assigned,
we generate diﬀerent realizations of realistic noise
maps.

4. Maps of the Compton y parameter from the cosmo-
OWLS simulations in Le Brun et al. (2014). We
use maps from the AGN8.0 model and convert the
Comptonization maps to CMB temperature units
by integrating the measured frequency response of
the instrument against a relativistic 5 keV tSZ
spectrum.

A modiﬁed version of the standard cluster-ﬁnding pro-
cess is run on the sum of these four components, and the
cluster candidates are recorded.
In addition, the same
spatial-spectral ﬁlter is applied to the maps only con-
taining SZ signal. The latter is used to identify cluster
candidates and deﬁne their SZ center. The amplitude in
these ﬁltered, SZ-only maps, divided by the standard de-
viation in a 90-arcminute strip in the ﬁltered maps that
include noise is precisely the unbiased signiﬁcance ζ in-
troduced in §2.1.1. These candidates are then compared
to the underlying halo catalog used to generate the mock
SZ maps, which provide the cluster redshift. For each SZ-
identiﬁed cluster candidate, we choose the nearest dark
matter halo with M200 > 5 × 1013M(cid:12).
With mass, unbiased signiﬁcance and redshift in hand,
we use the method of least absolute deviations to ﬁt the

Note. — The parameter αfield describes the number
of false detections expected above ξ = 5 scaled to 2500
square degrees, while βfield describes the scaling of the
number of false detections with ξ as deﬁned in Equation 3.
γfield describes the renormalization of ASZ in the SZ-mass
scaling relation of Equation 2.

ζ - M relation from Equation 2 over the range z > 0.25,
M500 > 1 × 1014M(cid:12). We ﬁnd nearly identical results
when using a linear least squares method. The normal-
ization parameter ASZ diﬀers from ﬁeld to ﬁeld by up
to 30%, while the other scaling relation parameters only
vary at the few percent level. We therefore model ﬁeld
variation with one parameter γﬁeld that renormalizes the
overall scaling: ASZ → γﬁeldASZ. For consistency with
previous publications, we normalize γﬁeld such that the
weighted average over the three ﬁelds which share 100%
of the raw data used in R13 matches the weighted av-
erage in that work. We note that any other choice of
normalization would simply alter the deﬁnition of ASZ,
leaving all other results unaﬀected. The values of γﬁeld
are shown in Table 1.

The other ﬁeld-speciﬁc simulation is used to compute
the expected false detection rate. At a detection thresh-
old of ξ > 5, approximately 5% of cluster candidates are
expected to be false.
In order to simulate the rate of
false detections, we perform the cluster-ﬁnding process
on the simulated maps described above, omitting the SZ
component. The resulting number of cluster candidates
as a function of ξ is recorded for 100 such simulations.
To reduce shot noise from the ﬁnite number of simulated
realizations, we model the false detection rate with the
empirically chosen ﬁtting function

Nfalse(> ξ) = αﬁeld exp (−βﬁeld(ξ − 5)) .

(3)

The values of αﬁeld and βﬁeld are shown in Table 1. The
total number of expected false detections per 2500 square
degrees with ξ > 5 from these simulations is 18±4, which
is consistent with the number of optically unconﬁrmed
cluster candidates, 21 (B15).

As the SPT-SZ selection is essentially independent of
redshift, we require optical and—for the highest-redshift
systems—near-infrared (NIR) data to both conﬁrm the
SPT candidates as clusters and to obtain redshifts for
these systems. We provide a brief overview of this process
here; for more details readers are referred to B15.

As a ﬁrst step, each SPT cluster candidate is visually
inspected in imaging data from the Digitized Sky Sur-
vey (DSS),1 as we have found most SPT clusters at red-
shift z < 0.5 are visible in these scanned photographic
plates. These relatively low-redshift systems are then
reimaged with 1 – 2 m class telescopes to obtain robust
conﬁrmations and redshifts. Higher-redshift candidates
not visible in the DSS (or designated non-conﬁrmed after
imaging on the small telescopes) are observed with 4 –
6.5 m class telescopes. The latter observations are con-
ducted in two passes: ﬁrst-pass observations are designed
to ensure ≥ 5σ detection of 0.4L∗ red-sequence galaxies
(where L∗ is the characteristic luminosity that appears in
the Schechter (1976) formulation of the galaxy luminosity
function) at z < 0.75; higher-redshift clusters or candi-
dates not conﬁrmed in the ﬁrst pass are also observed
(telescope resources permitting) in the optical and/or
NIR to extend this redshift range to z > 0.9. In total
69/78 of the highest-redshift (z > 0.75) or non-conﬁrmed
systems received second-pass imaging; the majority of
these systems (58/78) were observed with Spitzer/IRAC
(Fazio et al. 2004, PI: Brodwin) at 3.6 µm and 4.5 µm to
a depth suﬃcient for the 10σ detection of 0.4L∗ galaxies
at z = 1.5 (Brodwin et al. 2010).

Following imaging, a few arcmin region around each
SPT location is searched for an overdensity of red-
sequence cluster galaxies. When such an overdensity is
identiﬁed, we conﬁrm the candidate as a cluster and as-
sign the system a redshift using a red-sequence model
calibrated using the subset of SPT clusters with spec-
troscopic redshifts. For candidates not conﬁrmed in our
imaging data we compute a redshift “lower limit” corre-
sponding to the highest redshift for which we would have
detected the overdensity of red galaxies we require to con-
ﬁrm a cluster (Song et al. 2012). The redshift range of the
conﬁrmed cosmological cluster sample is 0.25 ≤ z (cid:46) 1.7
with a median redshift zmed = 0.58. Typical redshift un-
certainties range from σz ∼0.02×(1 + z) for the optical-
based redshifts to ∼0.035×(1 + z) for clusters with red-
shifts determined from Spitzer/IRAC observations.

A large subset (31%) of the SPT cosmological cluster
sample has also been spectroscopically observed. Spec-
troscopic redshifts for 86 SPT clusters were obtained
as part of a dedicated follow-up campaign using spec-
trographs on the Magellan telescope, the Gemini-South
telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We have also
searched the literature for cluster counterparts and ﬁnd
an additional 21 clusters with reported spectroscopic red-
shifts. The spectroscopic sample spans almost the full
redshift range of the cluster sample, from 0.26 < z ≤
1.478, with a median redshift of zmed = 0.53. The SPT
spectroscopic follow-up eﬀort is described in detail in
Ruel et al. (2014), and the redshifts are presented in B15.

4. CHANDRA X-RAY DATASET AND METHODS

3. REDSHIFT ESTIMATION

1 http://archive.stsci.edu/dss/

6

The X-ray data used in this work were originally pre-
sented in McDonald et al. (2013b) and most were ac-
quired as part of a Chandra X-ray Visionary Project
(PI: Benson).
In general, exposure times were chosen
to ensure 2000 X-ray counts, based on measured ROSAT
ﬂuxes (when available) or a combination of the LX − M
relation and mass estimates from the SZ signal. Data
were obtained using the front-illuminated ACIS-I CCDs,
and cleaned for background ﬂares before applying cali-
bration corrections using ciao v4.7 and caldb v4.6.8.

Global cluster properties (e.g., gas mass Mg,500 and
X-ray temperature kT500) for each cluster are derived in
McDonald et al. (2013b), following closely the procedures
described in Andersson et al. (2011). For a detailed de-
scription of the X-ray analysis, the reader is directed to
these works. In this work, we make use of the mass proxy
YX, which is obtained from the measured gas mass and
X-ray temperature. This temperature kT500 is derived
by ﬁrst assuming some value of r500 (i.e., 1 Mpc), and
measuring the core-excised (0.15 r500 to 1.0 r500) tem-
perature within this radius. Using this temperature, we
compute a new estimate of r500 using the TX−M relation
from V09. The temperature is then measured within this
radius, and the process is repeated until it converges.

We also measure the enclosed gas mass as a function
of r500, following the procedures described in McDonald
et al. (2013a). This involves measuring the X-ray surface
brightness in the rest-frame energy range 0.7 − 2.0 keV
as a function of radius, and ﬁtting a line-of-sight pro-
jected model for the electron density proﬁle to these
data, following Vikhlinin et al. (2006).
In converting
from the electron density to the gas density, we assume
ρg = mpneA/Z, where A = 1.397 is the average nuclear
charge and Z = 1.199 is the average nuclear mass. The
enclosed gas mass within a given radius is simply the vol-
ume integral of the gas density proﬁle out to the speciﬁed
radius.

These two quantities are combined into the mass proxy
YX. Since r500 must be known to compute Mg,500, we nu-
merically solve YX = Mg,500kT500 together with the scal-
ing relation given in Equation 4. This numerical calcula-
tion is performed for each set of cosmological parameters
that will be explored in §5.

4.1. YX - M Scaling Relation Parameterization

Following V09, B13, R13, and Bocquet et al. (2015),
we use YX as a proxy for the total cluster mass. We write
the scaling relation as

where the parameters AX, BX, CX describe the normal-
ization, mass dependence and redshift dependence of the
relation, respectively.2 As we did for the ζ - M rela-
tion, we introduce a parameter σln Yx which models a

the results in this work.

log-normal intrinsic scatter in the YX - M relation. We
allow the intrinsic scatter in the YX - M relation and
the ζ - M relation to be correlated, parameterizing this
with the correlation coeﬃcient ρζ,Yx. We follow B13 and
R13 and apply Gaussian priors of BX = 0.57 ± 0.03,
CX = −0.40 ± 0.20, and σln Yx = 0.12 ± 0.08, respec-
tively, as well as a uniform prior between −0.98 and 0.98
on ρζ,Yx.

4.2. Prior on the Normalization of the YX - M

Relation

In B13 and R13, we used a prior on the normalization
of the YX - M relation, AX, motivated from V09. In V09,
the normalization was cross-checked against weak lensing
mass estimates from Hoekstra (2007) for the 10 clusters
at z < 0.3 that, at the time, also had suﬃcient Chan-
dra observations to measure YX.
In B13, this normal-
ization was remeasured using more recent weak lensing
mass estimates from Hoekstra et al. (2012), and found
to be consistent with the assumed calibration from V09.
In this work, we revisit the YX - M normalization again,
using the most recent weak lensing mass estimates from
H15 to constrain any mean oﬀset in the normalization of
the original hydrostatic mass calibration of the YX-mass
scaling relation from V09. In addition, we also consider
any systematic oﬀset in the H15 weak lensing mass es-
timates, by comparing to alternative weak lensing mass
estimates from WtG.

In Figure 1, we compare weak lensing-based mass esti-
mates from H15 to YX-based mass estimates and to weak-
lensing masses from WtG. We have remeasured YX from
archival Chandra X-ray data for the 14 clusters from H15
with suﬃciently deep X-ray measurements, which we use
to estimate a cluster mass (MYx) using the YX-mass scal-
ing relation from V09. For these clusters, we also remea-
sure the deprojected weak-lensing aperture mass from
the H15 dataset using the X-ray implied r500. Using the
X-ray implied r500 approximates what would happen if
the weak lensing mass estimates were included in a joint
YX- WL scaling relation ﬁt because of the relatively low
scatter of YX with cluster mass, and, as we will show
later, the agreement in the resulting YX - M relation.
To compare H15 and WtG mass estimates at the same
radius, we extract a WtG mass for each of the 18 clusters
in common at the value of r500 implied by the H15 analy-
sis. We speciﬁcally use the mass estimates computed by
ﬁtting an NFW model to the observed shear proﬁles from
the WtG “color-cut” method (Applegate et al. 2014).

In Table 2, we give three diﬀerent measures of the rela-
tive cluster mass estimates between H15, WtG, and V09.
First, we ﬁt a scaling relation of the form ln(MWL) =
A + ln(MYx) with a free log-normal intrinsic scatter, us-
ing the Bayesian linear regression ﬁtting code from Kelly
(2007). For comparison, we also estimate the bootstrap
mean and median of the log of the mass ratio, which
makes no assumption about the underlying scatter.

First considering the mass ratio between H15 and V09,
we ﬁnd all three estimates imply a mass ratio near unity
with the scaling relation, bootstrap mean, and bootstrap
median giving ratios of 1.01 ± 0.07, 1.03 ± 0.06, and
1.12 ± 0.05, respectively. This implies that the YX-based
masses from V09 are in relatively good agreement with
H15, with the H15 masses ∼1-12% larger, depending on
how the mass ratio is estimated. Next, we consider the

Mass ratios between weak lensing (H15, WtG) and YX

(V09) based mass estimates.

mass ratio between WtG and H15. We also ﬁnd that all
three estimates imply a mass ratio near unity with the
scaling relation, bootstrap mean, and bootstrap median
giving ratios of 1.06 ± 0.07, 1.07 ± 0.07, and 1.11 ± 0.05,
respectively. Therefore the weak lensing-based mass es-
timates from H15 and WtG are also in relatively good
agreement, with the WtG masses ∼6-11% larger, com-
parable to the 7% estimated systematic uncertainty from
H15. The overlapping cluster sample between our V09-
YX sample and WtG is smaller (eight clusters), and there-
fore has larger uncertainty on the mass ratio. We ﬁnd
that the three diﬀerent mass ratio estimates between
WtG and V09 range from 1.15 − 1.24. This range is
somewhat larger, but comparable with, the expectation
when considering the mass ratios of the larger samples
used to calculate the WtG/H15 and H15/V09 mass ra-
tios, which would predict a mass ratio between WtG and
V09 of ∼ 1.1 − 1.2.

In summary, comparing to the original YX - M calibra-
tion from V09, we ﬁnd that the weak lensing measure-
ments imply a normalization that increases the YX-based
cluster masses by a factor between 1.0 and 1.2, depending
on the weak lensing analysis and dataset (H15, WtG),
and the ﬁt assumptions. We therefore choose a Gaus-
sian prior on the normalization of our YX - M relation
of AX = 6.35 ± 0.61, which increases the normalization
from V09 by a factor of 1.1 with an overall uncertainty of
10%. We expect that this uncertainty includes the sum
of our statistical and systematic uncertainty, because it
brackets the range of values in the above comparison with
the weak lensing measurements and is comparable to our
naive expectation given the statistical uncertainty in the
ﬁt above and the systematic uncertainty estimated in
H15. This eﬀectively gives us a purely weak lensing-
derived mass scale, independent of the hydrostatic mass
estimates. We expect our constraints on the mass scale
to improve in future work using weak lensing observa-
tions of SPT-SZ survey clusters, which we will then be
able to directly include in our cosmological analysis.

Finally, we have also estimated the dependence of the
weak-lensing and X-ray-derived mass estimates on cos-
mological parameters. Over the range of cosmological
parameters explored, the ratio of the two varies negligi-
bly compared to the uncertainty of 10%.

5. COSMOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

Armed with the abundance of clusters as a function of
the observables z, ξ, and YX, and models of the scaling of
these observables with cluster mass, we are almost ready
to place constraints on cosmological parameters. For the
ﬁnal step, we need a theoretical framework for translating
cosmological parameters into a prediction for the number
of clusters as a function of mass and redshift, and we need
a statistical method for comparing those predictions to

mass estimates from WtG (red) and YX-based mass estimates using

ray implied r500. The solid grey line shows a one-to-one relation,

our observed abundance. For both of these requirements,
we closely follow the methods of V10, B13, and R13.

5.1. Parameters to Cluster Abundance Predictions
For a given set of cosmological parameters, we use
the Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background
(CAMB, Lewis et al. 2000) to generate the matter power
spectrum as a function of redshift. We use this power
spectrum as input to the Tinker et al. (2008) halo mass
function, with which we calculate the number of dark
matter halos as a function of spherical overdensity mass
M500 and redshift.

More recent results (e.g., Bhattacharya et al. 2011;
Skillman et al. 2014) conﬁrm that, over the range of clus-
ter masses and redshifts considered in this work, the Tin-
ker mass function is accurate to a level that is more than
suﬃcient for the cosmological parameter constraints pre-
sented in this work. For instance, even a shift as large as
10% in the halo mass function at M500 ∼ 3 × 1014 M(cid:12)
would only aﬀect the cosmological constraints presented
in §6.2 at the (cid:46) 0.2σ level.

Given the Tinker mass function, we relate the clus-
ter mass to the observed quantities ξ and YX using the
scaling relations described in §2.1.1 and §4.1.

In our default cosmological analysis, we use the stan-
dard six-parameter ΛCDM model, parameterized by the
physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter at
z = 0, Ωbh2 and Ωch2, the angular scale of the sound
horizon at last scattering θs, the tilt of the scalar power
spectrum ns, the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum
As, and the optical depth to reionization τ . We will often
refer to values of parameters derived from combinations
of these original six, such as σ8, the amplitude of linear

matter ﬂuctuations on 8 Mpc/h scales at z = 0, Ωm, the
total matter density at z = 0, and H0 = 100h km/s/Mpc,
the value of the Hubble parameter at z = 0. We explore
three extensions to ΛCDM. We ﬁrst explore a model
in which the sum of the neutrino masses Σmν is a free
parameter.
In this work we use the prescription from
Costanzi et al. (2013) to predict the eﬀect of massive
neutrinos on the halo mass function. We also consider
a cosmological model in which Σmν and Neﬀ , the eﬀec-
tive number of relativistic particle species, are both free
parameters, and a model in which w, the parameter de-
scribing the equation of state of dark energy, is allowed
to vary.

5.2. Cluster Likelihood Evaluation

To compare theoretical predictions for cluster abun-
dance to the observations in this work, we closely follow
the likelihood derivation of V10, B13, and R13. We dif-
fer from those analyses in this work by presenting an
eﬃcient numerical technique that scales linearly rather
than exponentially with the number of mass proxies.

As is appropriate for a cluster abundance measurement
(Hu & Kravtsov 2003; Holder 2006), we start with the
binned Poisson statistic. For a given observable-space
bin xi, the probability of observing n events, with expec-
tation value y(xi) is

Pi =

e−y(xi)y(xi)n

n!

.

(5)

We choose to take the limit of small bins where y becomes
arbitrarily small at all xi, and n is zero except at the
locations of xi where clusters have been observed (Mantz
et al. 2008, 2010, V09). If we let xj denote the bin that
contains the jth cluster, we obtain

(cid:88)

ln Pi = −(cid:88)

lnL =

y(xi) +

ln y(xj).

In our case, we are dealing with the three-dimensional
cluster observable space x = [z, ξ, YX], though this
method generalizes eﬃciently to a larger number of ob-
servables. Writing the model expectation value y(xi) =
N (zi, ξi, YX,i) and going to one-dimensional indices gives

where the i1, i2, i3 sums again run over all possible val-

detected. Going to the continuous limit would result in
a divergent likelihood expression. This can be under-
stood by the fact that the model is increasingly unlikely
to produce our particular realization of the cluster cat-
alog as we go to ﬁner binning. The divergence can be
removed by simply adding − ln ∆z∆ξ∆YX to Equation
7. This quantity depends only on bin size, so that ∆ lnL
for diﬀerent values of cosmological or scaling relation pa-
rameters remains meaningful. We then obtain the ex-

V10, B13, and R13 evaluated this expression on either a
two-dimensional or three-dimensional uniformly spaced
grid. Each dimension was gridded into several hundred
points, such that the computational cost rises exponen-
tially with the number of mass proxies. The computa-
tional cost was trivial for V10, challenging for B13 and
R13, and likely untractable in future work if another
mass proxy is added. The techniques used in Mantz et al.
(2010) and Vikhlinin et al. (2009b) also scale exponen-
tially with the number of mass proxies.

Instead of computing Equation 8 on a uniformly spaced
grid, we use the following numerical techniques. First,
we note that the follow-up mass proxy YX immediately
integrates out of the ﬁrst term. This applies to any mass
proxy that does not aﬀect the survey selection function.
Therefore, we only need to perform a two-dimensional

to evaluate. Employing a more compact notation with

The probability density functions P (xi,j|x(cid:48)

measurement error of the ith mass proxy (with the
measurements being independent). The P (x(cid:48)|z, ln M(cid:48))
implemented with
describe the joint scaling relations,
multi-dimensional log-normal intrinsic scatter.
In our
case of two mass proxies (ξ, YX), this is implemented
with three parameters: two parameters describing the
marginal variances and one correlation coeﬃcient, each
of which is marginalized over in this work.

The computational bottleneck for evaluating the clus-
ter likelihood in the presence of several mass proxies
lies in evaluating Equation 11. Considering a slice in
redshift, we have to perform an (Nobs + 1)-dimensional
integral. To do so, we perform Monte-Carlo inte-

are constructed to be correctly normalized. Due to the
treatment of maximization bias in §2.1.1, the normaliza-

In order to eﬃciently draw samples we ﬁrst, for each

which is assumed to be independent for each i. We then
substitute these values into the scaling relations to obtain

and combine with Equation 14 to obtain an estimate
for Equation 11. Our implementation of this estimator
has been demonstrated to be unbiased through extensive
simulations, with well-behaved residuals. The error on
the mean is found to decrease as the inverse square root of
the number of deviates drawn. In practice, for two mass

proxies and 377 cluster candidates, we draw 104 devi-
ates per cluster candidate, resulting in RMS noise on the
likelihood surface of ∆(−2 lnL) (cid:46) 0.1 near the maximum
likelihood. For the cluster catalog used in this work, the
execution time is approximately one second on a single
CPU thread. This likelihood module has been checked
against an independent implementation, based on the es-
timator presented in Bocquet et al. (2015). The compar-
ison shows agreement to well within the 1-σ uncertainties
on the cosmological parameter constraints found in this
work.

5.3. External Datasets

In §6, we will discuss the cosmological constraints ob-
tained using the analysis laid out so far. We will eval-
uate the compatibility of the cluster data with other
datasets, as well as show the improvements in parameter
constraints when the cluster dataset is combined with
other datasets. The primary external data we use are
CMB power spectrum measurements, measurements of
BAO from galaxy surveys, and distances to Type Ia su-
pernovae (SNe).

The canonical CMB power spectrum data we use is
the temperature-temperature power spectrum from the
Planck 2013 release, combined with low-(cid:96) polarization
information from WMAP (Planck Collaboration et al.
2014a, hereafter Planck+WP). The qualitative results
from this work will be very similar to those that would
have been obtained by considering the Planck 2015
dataset, since the constraints on σ8 and Ωm from the
temperature and low-(cid:96) polarization power spectrum are
very similar between the two Planck releases. In §6.2,
we will brieﬂy review the eﬀect of substituting the best
CMB power spectrum data from before the Planck 2013
release, using instead the combination of WMAP9 (Hin-
shaw et al. 2013) and SPT (Story et al. 2013, hereafter
S13) CMB power spectrum data.

We sometimes use a prior on the angular scale of the
sound horizon θs. This is a powerful piece of cosmological
information, and relies only very weakly on the details of
the CMB analysis, since it is sensitive to peak positions.
We use the Planck+WP measurement, though we con-
servatively increase the uncertainty by a factor of ﬁve to
100θMC = 1.0413±0.0034.3 Since θs is so well-measured,
none of the results presented in this work that use a prior
on θs are sensitive to the speciﬁc value of the assumed
uncertainty.

When BAO data are used in this work, we use the
SDSS-III BOSS results from data release 11. Speciﬁcally,
we use the measurements of the parameter combination
DV /rs at z = 0.32 (LOWZ) and z = 0.57 (CMASS) from
Anderson et al. (2014).

When considering cosmologies with a free parameter
describing the dark energy equation of state, we com-
pare to and contrast with the SN results from the joint
likelihood analysis of the SDSS-II and SNLS SN samples
from Betoule et al. (2014).

Cluster abundances do weakly constrain the baryon
density, but for our main results we choose to adopt a
prior based on big-bang nucleosynthesis calculations and
deuterium abundance measurements of Ωbh2 = 0.02202±
3 θMC is the approximation to θs used in CosmoMC (Lewis &

Bridle 2002).

10

0.00045 (Cooke et al. 2014). This uncertainty is subdom-
inant for all results presented in this work.
Finally, where stated, we adopt a prior of H0 = 73.8±
2.4 km/s/Mpc from the direct H0 measurements of Riess
et al. (2011). We ﬁnd that changing this prior by 1σ
aﬀects the resulting σ8 constraint by (cid:46) 0.2σ, while the
Ωm constraint is aﬀected by ∼ 0.4σ. These two eﬀects are
anti-correlated such that the commonly used parameter
combination σ8 (Ωm/0.27)0.3 is highly insensitive to the
assumed value of H0.

6. COSMOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS

In this section, we discuss the parameter constraints
obtained using the data and methods described in the
previous sections. We ﬁrst explain which parameters
and combinations of parameters are most strongly con-
strained by cluster abundance measurements. We then
discuss the constraints from this cluster sample, both in
comparison to and in combination with other cosmologi-
cal datasets, for diﬀerent choices of cosmological models.
We assume spatial ﬂatness throughout this work.

6.1. Parameter Sensitivity to Cluster Abundance

A measurement of cluster abundance as a function
of redshift provides constraints on cosmological parame-
ters through several mechanisms. First, the total num-
ber of clusters found strongly depends on the matter
density and the amplitude of the matter power spec-
trum (e.g., Bahcall & Cen 1992; White et al. 1993). As
shown in, e.g., White et al. (1993), a simple spherical-
collapse model
for the halo mass function (Press &
Schechter 1974) indicates that the total number of clus-
ters should most strongly constrain the parameter combi-
nation σ8Ωα
m, where α is related to the local slope of the
matter power spectrum at the mean mass of the cluster
catalog. This prediction has been empirically borne out
in many cluster abundance studies, including this one.

The redshift dependence of the cluster abundance con-
tains information on the growth function, as well as a
dependence on the cosmic volume surveyed. This com-
bination of sensitivity to growth and volume provides a
unique constraint on parameters that aﬀect the expan-
sion history, notably w, the equation of state of dark
energy (e.g., Haiman et al. 2001). In the case of w, the
eﬀect of changing this parameter on the cluster abun-
dance actually changes sign at z ∼ 1 (e.g., Fig. 1 of
Mohr 2005). The 377 cluster candidates presented in this
work provide a large enough sample to constrain cosmo-
logical parameters by measuring the evolution of cluster
abundance. However, this constraint is also potentially
limited by knowledge of the observable-mass scaling re-
lations, in this case their evolution with redshift. This is
further discussed in the context of dark energy in §6.5.
In addition to their eﬀect on the true abundance of
clusters as a function of mass and redshift, cosmological
parameters also aﬀect the cluster observables through
their inﬂuence on the SZ and X-ray scaling relations.
Speciﬁcally, while the mass estimate inferred from the
ζ - M relation depends weakly on redshift, the mass es-
timate inferred from the YX - M scaling relation depends
strongly on the angular diameter distance to the cluster.

6.2. ΛCDM

Fig. 2.— Comparison of cluster constraints on σ8 and Ωm from
this work with those from previous SPT publications. The B13
analysis (outermost, gray contours) used 18 clusters, 14 of which
have Chandra observations. The number of clusters increased to
100 in R13 (red contours), whereas this work uses 377 cluster can-
didates, 82 of which have high-quality Chandra observations. If
we adopt the same observable-mass priors as B13 and R13, we ob-
tain the innermost, purple contours. However, the main results in
this paper assume a new weak lensing-based prior on the X-ray
scaling relation normalization, which changes the central value by
10% and increases the 1σ uncertainty slightly from 9% to 11%. The
σ8-Ωm constraints using this prior and the current cluster data are
shown by the light-blue contours.

In this section, we present constraints on the parame-
ters of the ΛCDM model. Because not all parameters of
this model are well constrained by cluster counts alone,
we adopt priors on some of the six parameters (Ωbh2,
Ωch2, θs, ns, As, and τ , deﬁned in §5.1). The cluster
likelihood is insensitive to the optical depth to reioniza-
tion τ as well as to the primordial scalar spectrum power
law index ns, once an appropriate pivot point is chosen.
Therefore, when discussing cluster constraints without
the inclusion of CMB temperature power spectrum data,
we ﬁx these parameters to the best-ﬁt values from Planck
Collaboration et al. (2014a).

These two prior constraints, in addition to the H0 and
BBN priors discussed in 5.3, leave us two remaining de-
grees of freedom in the ΛCDM model, which we choose
to express as Ωm and σ8 (though in exploring the likeli-
hood surface we actually vary the base parameters Ωbh2,
Ωch2, ln 1010As and H0). We ﬁx the species-summed
neutrino mass Σmν to 0.06 eV, the minimum allowed
value from terrestrial measurements of squared neutrino
mass diﬀerences (see e.g. Gonzalez-Garcia et al. 2012,
for a review). Figure 2 shows the constraints on σ8 and
Ωm from B13, R13 and this work. The large increase
in the number of clusters primarily reduces the uncer-
tainty on Ωm by constraining the shape of the halo mass
function. The uncertainty on the parameter combina-
tion σ8 (Ωm/0.27)0.3 is set by the knowledge of the over-
all mass scale, rather than the number of clusters, since
Poisson errors on this number are subdominant. The im-
provement in the σ8 (Ωm/0.27)0.3constraint results from
the increase in the number of clusters with Chandra
follow-up data. These two eﬀects result in tighter joint
constraints on the two parameters than we obtained in

previous cluster analyses, if we use the same prior on the
observable-mass relations. This can be seen in Figure 2:
the innermost, purple contours use the current cluster
sample and the same observable-mass priors as B13 and
R13. However, in contrast to B13 and R13 we choose
to use a weak lensing-based prior on the overall mass
scale for our baseline results, as discussed in 4.2. This
results in slightly degraded constraints, in particular on
σ8, as can be seen from the light-blue contours in Figure
2. With the current cluster sample, the stated priors on
cosmological parameters, and the updated priors on the
observable-mass relations, we obtain
σ8 = 0.784 ± 0.039,
Ωm = 0.289 ± 0.042,

(17)

and

σ8 (Ωm/0.27)0.3 = 0.797 ± 0.031.

The ΛCDM parameter constraints, including scaling re-
lation parameters, are shown in Table 3.

In the left- and right-hand panels of Figure 3 we
show the cluster abundance as a function of redshift
and detection signiﬁcance, respectively. Both show one-
√
dimensional representations of the observable-space mass
function. The data points, with approximate (
N ) error
bars shown, are independent of cosmological and scal-
ing relation parameters. The points are independent be-
tween bins for dN/dξ, and nearly independent for dN/dz,
where clusters without spectroscopic redshift information
can contribute to multiple bins.

Shifts in the parameters σ8 and ASZ result in roughly
global shifts in the amplitude of both curves, simulta-
neously. The scaling relation parameter BSZ induces a
roughly power-law tilt in dN/dξ, and parameters such as
CSZ and Ωm induce tilts in dN/dz. This visualization
shows two important ways in which the model, marginal-
ized over a large number of scaling relation and cosmo-
logical parameters, is tested for agreement with the data.
Figure 4 shows the cluster constraints on the ΛCDM
model in the σ8-Ωm plane, when combined with either
the H0+BBN prior or the BAO+θs+BBN prior. We also

show the constraints from CMB power spectrum mea-
surements from Planck+WP and WMAP9+S13 data.
The 68% conﬁdence regions from the cluster constraints
and the CMB power spectrum constraints overlap. We
proceed to adopt the Planck+WP dataset as the base-
line CMB dataset for the remainder of this work. We also
combine the SPTCL+Planck+WP+BAO datasets to ob-
tain joint ΛCDM parameter constraints. Finally, we note
that the σ8 constraint obtained using the SPTCL data in
Table 3 is within 1σ of the value recently reported by the
Planck collaboration for the full-mission data (their 2015
TT+lowP+lensing dataset) of σ8 = 0.815 ± 0.009 .
6.2.1. Constraints on Scaling Relation Parameters

logical constraints, the nuisance parameters are of inter-
est themselves, both in terms of the cluster scaling re-
lation parameter constraints and their degeneracy with

the cosmological parameters. In Figure 5, we show the
marginalized posterior in the multi-dimensional parame-
ter space.

The dominant systematic uncertainty limiting the cos-
mological constraints from the SPT-SZ cluster sample is
the uncertainty of the overall cluster mass scale. This
can be seen as a strong degeneracy between AX and
σ8 (Ωm/0.27)0.3, which are 85% correlated given the
SPTCL+H0+BBN dataset. The second-most important
source of systematic uncertainty in the cosmological con-
straints is from the parameter characterizing the redshift
evolution of the scaling relation, CSZ. In a ΛCDM cos-
mology, it is highly degenerate with Ωm, correlated at
87% when considering the SPTCL+H0+BBN dataset.

The parameters that shift most signiﬁcantly away from
their priors are the BSZ and BX parameters which encode
the power-law slopes of the scaling relations. We ﬁnd
that the preference for high BSZ persists when the X-
ray data are not used.
In addition, this preference is
not localized to any particular region of the data; when
considering half the cluster sample at a time, either by
redshift, ξ, or γﬁeld, the high BSZ persists, albeit at a
lower signiﬁcance.

This high BSZ implies that the measured observable-
space mass function, dN/dξ, is shallower than expected
given the scaling relation found from the simulations de-
scribed in §2.2. We can approximately quantify this by
assuming dN/dξ follows a power law. The data prefers
a power-law index of ∼ 4.0, compared to the simulation
prediction of ∼ 5.0, which is disfavored by the measured
dN/dξ at ∼ 4.5σ.

The preference for a higher BSZ, i.e., a steeper ζ - M
relation, is statistically weak, approximately 1σ, due to
the relatively weak 20% width assumed on the BSZ prior.
By contrast, the assumed width of the prior on the X-
ray scaling relation slope BX is 5%, leading to a tension
between the likelihood and the prior of approximately
4σ. There is some evidence for a similarly steep YX - M
scaling relation from the comparison of the V09 and H15
weak lensing mass estimates in Figure 1, which prefers
BX ∼ 0.42. Such a slope would be in ∼ 4σ tension with
the expected self-similar cluster slope of BX = 0.6.

In this work, we will assume that our observational
priors on the YX - M slope and theoretical priors on the
mass function slope are well motivated, but note that the
shape of the observable-space mass function will need to
be studied in more detail for future work.

6.3. ΛCDM + Σmν

We now consider a cosmological model in which the
species-summed neutrino mass Σmν is a free parameter.
Constraints on this model from the CMB power spec-
trum show a strong degeneracy between σ8 and Σmν
(e.g., Komatsu et al. 2009; Planck Collaboration et al.
2014a; Abazajian et al. 2015). This allows even modest
measurements of σ8 to improve on neutrino mass con-
straints from the CMB power spectrum data alone. Fig-
ure 6 shows the improvement in constraints when adding
cluster abundance information to CMB power spectrum
data alone (Planck+WP), and also when including BAO
data. In both cases, the addition of cluster information
tightens the constraint and causes the posterior to peak
at positive values of Σmν, though the 95% upper limit on
Σmν remains largely unchanged. Allowing the Σmν to
vary in the range of 0–2 eV, and using the combination
of the SPTCL+Planck+WP+BAO datasets, we ﬁnd

Σmν = 0.14 ± 0.08 eV.

(19)

We note that the preference for positive Σmν, when
we combine our cluster abundance measurements with
Planck data, is driven by the small residual tension be-
tween the preferred values of σ8 in the two datasets.
Such a preference has been pointed out by several au-
thors (e.g., Planck Collaboration et al. 2014b; Wyman
et al. 2014; Battye & Moss 2014), but is in contrast
to the preference for positive Σmν shown, for example,
by the combination of WMAP+SPT CMB power spec-
trum data and SPT cluster data in Hou et al. (2014),
in which the evidence for positive Σmν is not driven by
the cluster data. In this work, we ﬁnd relatively good
agreement between the preferred σ8 using the CMB and
SPTCL datasets, so the preference for positive Σmν is
weak and consistent at 1σ with the minimum expected
value of ∼0.06 eV from neutrino oscillation experiments
(Lesgourgues & Pastor 2006). Relative to the previous
cluster-based constraints cited above, the updated weak
lensing-based calibration described in §4.2, has shifted
the normalization and increased the uncertainty of the
observable-mass relation in a way that relieves tension
with the Planck CMB data (see Figure 2). We also note
that our constraint on Σmν is largely independent of the
change in the optical depth to reionization, τ , between
the Planck 2013 and 2015 data release; the SPTCL con-
straints are independent of τ , and the Planck CMB con-
straints on σ8 and Ωm negligibly changed between the

two data releases.

6.4. ΛCDM + Σmν + Neﬀ

The eﬀective number of relativistic species, Neﬀ , af-
fects the CMB power spectrum by altering the time of
matter-radiation equality, changing the apparent sound
horizon at recombination (e.g., Hou et al. 2013). This
mechanism results in strong degeneracies between Neﬀ
and other cosmological parameters, notably H0 and σ8,
when considering CMB data alone (e.g., Bashinsky &
Seljak 2004). Thus, the addition of constraints on σ8—

such as from the cluster data in this work—and H0 can
improve upon CMB-only constraints on Neﬀ .

Here, we consider simultaneously varying the species-
summed neutrino mass and the eﬀective number of
relativistic species.
In this cosmological model, the
Planck+WP data alone constrain the σ8-Ωm-H0 parame-
ter volume relatively poorly. Adding the cluster informa-
tion improves on all three of those parameters by roughly
a factor of two. Through parameter degeneracies, this
improves the simultaneous constraints on Neﬀ and Σmν

energy equation of state parameter w. Using priors on H0 and
Ωbh2, the SPT cluster data are able to simultaneously constrain
the two parameters, and are in good agreement with the other
probes. The other probes are sensitive to dark energy primarily
through its eﬀect on the geometry of the universe.

ther tightened with the addition of local H0 measure-
ments, with the caveat that the best-ﬁt value of H0
from the SPTCL+Planck+WP+BAO dataset, H0 =
68.6± 1.2 km/s/Mpc, is in mild tension with direct local
measurements from Riess et al. (2011). Proceeding to
add those local measurements, such that we consider a
SPTCL+Planck+WP+H0+BAO dataset, we ﬁnd a pref-
erence for larger Neﬀ , resulting in the marginalized con-
straints of

Neﬀ = 3.43 ± 0.16

and

Σmν = 0.16 ± 0.08 eV.

(22)

(23)

The combined dataset has a 2.3σ preference for Neﬀ >
3.046, the standard model prediction. This is partially
driven by the weak tension between local H0 measure-
ments and the Planck+BAO dataset, as has been noted
by other authors (e.g., Hou et al. 2014; Wyman et al.
2014; Battye & Moss 2014). However, the sensitivity to
the H0 prior is relatively weak. The preference for Neﬀ
exceeding the standard model prediction would still be
2.0σ if the central value of the H0 prior was reduced by
one standard deviation.

6.5. wCDM

With the increased number of clusters in this work we
are able to place constraints not only on the local cluster
abundance but also on the evolution of cluster abundance
with redshift. In particular, we examine the constraints
on the wCDM cosmology, where the equation of state of
dark energy w is a free parameter. We assume that w is
a constant (i.e., its value does not evolve with redshift).
This additional parameter aﬀects the cluster abundance
and observables through its inﬂuence on the geometry
of the universe and, more importantly, the growth of
structure. The geometrical eﬀects include the change in
the survey volume element and the angular diameter dis-
tance that modiﬁes the implied X-ray mass information.

For the dataset combination H0+BAO+SNe, which
does not include primary CMB data, σ8 is not deter-
mined. Adding the cluster data improves the w con-
straint by 37% through a direct measurement of the dark
energy parameters w and ΩDE, rather than by breaking
the w-σ8 degeneracy. For this combination, we ﬁnd

w = −1.08 ± 0.07.

Finally, when considering the Planck+WP+H0+BAO
+SNe datasets, w is constrained to −1.062 ± 0.048. The
allowed parameter space shows a signiﬁcant w-σ8 degen-
eracy, which allows the addition of the cluster data to
improve this constraint by 14%, to

w = −1.023 ± 0.042,
consistent with ΛCDM where w = −1.

7. COMPARISON TO OTHER CLUSTER SURVEYS
In this section, we compare the SPTCL cosmological
constraints to results using other cluster surveys. We fo-
cus on the ΛCDM constraints from §6.2, which employed
a SPTCL+H0+BBN dataset, and where we constrained
σ8 (Ωm/0.27)0.3 = 0.797 ± 0.031 and σ8 = 0.784 ± 0.039.
When comparing to other results, we will discuss diﬀer-
ences where appropriate.

Other SZ cluster-based constraints include results from
the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT, Hasselﬁeld
et al. 2013) and Planck (Planck Collaboration et al.
2014b, 2015) cluster surveys. However, comparisons to
both are complicated by diﬀerences in the assumed mass
calibration. In Hasselﬁeld et al. (2013), the ACT collab-
oration reported cosmological constraints using 15 SZ-
selected clusters between 0.2 < z < 1.4. Several sets of
constraints were presented, which assumed diﬀerent pri-
ors on the SZ-scaling parameters and also included a cali-
bration based on the dynamical mass measurements from
Sif´on et al. (2013). The latter relied on a scaling relation
between velocity dispersion and cluster mass, which was
later found to be biased high by ∼20% when using more
recent simulations (Kirk et al. 2015). Using a ﬁxed SZ-
scaling relation based on the simulations from Battaglia
et al. (2012) i.e., without including any uncertainty in the
cluster mass calibration, the ACTCL+H0+BBN dataset
was used to constrain σ8 (Ωm/0.27)0.3 = 0.848 ± 0.032
and σ8 = 0.872 ± 0.065, consistent with the constraints
presented in this work.

The Planck collaboration has produced two cluster-
based cosmological analyses (Planck Collaboration et al.
2014b, 2015). Planck Collaboration et al. (2014b) used
a sample of 189 SZ-selected clusters between 0.0 < z <
0.55 with a median redshift of 0.15, which is lower red-
shift than the SPT cluster sample due to the Planck selec-
tion function. Assuming an identical H0+BBN dataset
to our work and assuming a ﬁxed scaling relation except
for an overall mass-bias factor b with a uniform prior be-
tween 0.7 and 1.0, they constrained σ8 (Ωm/0.27)0.3 =
0.774 ± 0.024 and σ8 = 0.77 ± 0.03, consistent with our
results. In Planck Collaboration et al. (2015), the pre-
vious scaling relation calibration was compared to more
recent weak lensing measurements (H15, WtG), which
are also used in this work. For example, H15 found a
mass-bias factor of 0.76 ± 0.08 for the Planck clusters
in their lensing sample. While no numerical constraints

Fig. 9.— Combined constraints on w and σ8. The CMB power
spectrum data from Planck+WP shows a strong degeneracy, while
the purely geometric constraints from H0+BAO+SNe do not con-
strain σ8. The cluster data simultaneously constrains the two pa-
rameters, improving the joint CMB+H0+BAO+SNe constraints
both through breaking the w-σ8 degeneracy present in the CMB
constraints, and the direct measurement of w.

However, in contrast to other probes of dark energy, the
cluster abundance measurement is very sensitive to the
eﬀect of w on the growth of structure, primarily σ8(z)
(e.g., Wang & Steinhardt 1998; Haiman et al. 2001).

In Figure 8, we show constraints on the dark energy
equation of state parameter w and the energy density of
dark energy today ΩDE for diﬀerent cosmological probes.
With the SPTCL+H0+BBN dataset, we obtain

w = −1.28 ± 0.31

(24)

(25)

and

ΩDE = 0.738 ± 0.046.

This is in good agreement, and of comparable precision,
with the constraints when considering other cosmological
probes, including Planck+WP, BAO, and SNe, as can
be seen in Figure 8. Since all these probes except the
cluster abundance measurement are geometrical tests in
this plane, the consistency between the cluster-implied
parameter constraints, and those from other datasets,
oﬀers an important systematic test of dark energy. This
measurement is limited primarily by our knowledge of
the redshift evolution of the ζ - M scaling relation, CSZ.
Speciﬁcally, both Ωm and w are correlated with CSZ at
the ∼ 60% level, whereas the correlation with AX is only
∼ 30%.

As shown in Figure 9, the Planck+WP measurements
of the primary CMB show a strong degeneracy between
w and σ8. The addition of cluster data breaks the de-
generacy and results in the marginalized constraints

w = −1.04 ± 0.17

(26)

and

σ8 = 0.803 ± 0.045.

(27)
This level of w-uncertainty is ∼2.5 times larger compared
to the constraints when adding either of the BAO or SNe
data sets to the Planck+WP measurements (Aubourg
et al. 2015; Betoule et al. 2014).

work, Weighing the Giants (WtG), and Planck+WP CMB mea-

ter constraints.

were given, the newer Planck constraints were found to
be consistent with the previous Planck results, and are
also visually in good agreement with our results using
this mass-bias factor.

In addition, our cosmological constraints are consis-
tent with other previous cluster surveys, including con-
straints from the X-ray selected sample from Vikhlinin
et al. (2009b) and the optically selected sample from
Rozo et al. (2010).

Finally, we compare to more recent cosmological con-
straints from WtG (Mantz et al. 2015). Their baseline
constraints incorporate a cluster sample selected from the
ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS), follow-up X-ray obser-
vations from Chandra, including cosmological constraints
from cluster gas-fraction (fgas, see Mantz et al. 2014)
measurements, and weak lensing data from WtG; a sub-
set of which we used to estimate our cluster mass cal-
ibration in Section 4.2.
In Figure 10, we compare di-
rectly to the WtG constraints in the σ8-Ωm plane (WtG
ﬁnd marginalized constraints of σ8 = 0.830 ± 0.035 and
Ωm = 0.259±0.030). We also plot the SPTCL constraints
with an additional prior of Ωb/Ωmh1.5 = 0.089 ± 0.012,
to mimic the fgas constraints.

Overall, we ﬁnd good agreement between our SPTCL
dataset and both the Planck-CMB and WtG data. The
agreement between the WtG and SPTCL constraints
is impressive considering the diﬀerent selection meth-
ods (SZ vs. X-ray), the diﬀerent X-ray observable (YX
vs. gas mass) and corresponding observable-mass scal-
ing relation, as well as the independent X-ray analysis
pipelines. This agreement extends to the wCDM cosmo-
logical model. For example, using the WtG cluster data
(including fgas measurements), Mantz et al. (2015) con-
strain w = −0.98 ± 0.15, consistent with the results in
Section 6.5. The combination of the two cluster datasets
is potentially very powerful for improving cluster-based
constraints due to the diﬀerent redshift ranges of each
sample; the majority of the WtG sample is at z < 0.25,
below the lower redshift cut of the SPTCL sample used

in this work. This is particularly important for cluster-
based constraints on dark energy because the combined
data sets would provide improved constraints on the evo-
lution of the cluster mass function. This complemen-
tarity was also noted in Mantz et al. (2015), who es-
timated that the combined datasets could improve the
WtG cluster-based constraints on dark energy and mod-
iﬁed gravity by a factor of >2.

8. CONCLUSION

In this work, we have taken a well-deﬁned subsam-
ple of the SPT cluster catalog from Bleem et al. (2015),
selecting only for redshift z > 0.25 and SPT-SZ detec-
tion signiﬁcance ξ > 5. In order to obtain cosmological
constraints, we combine this cluster catalog with Chan-
dra X-ray observations for 82 clusters. In addition, we
adopt a purely weak lensing-based prior on the overall
mass scale of the sample from a reanalysis of Vikhlinin
et al. (2009b) using the more recent weak lensing mass
estimates from Hoekstra et al. (2015, denoted with H15)
and the Weighing the Giants (WtG) project (Kelly et al.
2014; Applegate et al. 2014; von der Linden et al. 2014a;
Mantz et al. 2015). The 1σ width of this prior is 10%,
which is limited by the small number of clusters in the
reanalysis.

The computation of the cluster likelihood uses a new
algorithm that scales linearly with the number of mass
proxies, where previous algorithms scaled exponentially,
which makes incorporating more mass proxies such as
weak lensing shear, velocity dispersions, and/or multiple
X-ray mass proxies computationally tractable. Our algo-
rithm includes the option to marginalize over all possible
correlations between the observables.

Assuming a ΛCDM cosmology and combining with
H0+BBN, we ﬁnd the marginalized constraints σ8 =
0.784 ± 0.039 and Ωm = 0.289 ± 0.042. The combined
parameter combination σ8 (Ωm/0.27)0.3 is constrained
to 0.797 ± 0.031. We ﬁnd good agreement with the
parameter constraints obtained from the WtG project,
as well as CMB constraints from either WMAP9+S13
(Hinshaw et al. 2013; Story et al. 2013) or Planck+WP
(Planck Collaboration et al. 2014a). We proceed to adopt
Planck+WP as our baseline CMB dataset.

We consider several extensions to the ΛCDM model.
When we allow the species-summed neutrino mass to be
a free parameter, the addition of cluster information to
CMB information causes the posterior to peak at pos-
itive values of neutrino mass (though it is consistent
with zero). The same behavior is seen when combin-
ing with CMB+BAO, yielding Σmν = 0.14 ± 0.08 eV.
When further allowing the eﬀective number of relativis-
tic species Neﬀ to be a free parameter, and combining
with CMB+H0+BAO, we ﬁnd Neﬀ = 3.43 ± 0.16 and
Σmν = 0.16 ± 0.08 eV.
Finally, when the dark energy equation of state pa-
rameter w is allowed to be free, this cluster catalog can
be combined only with priors on H0 and Ωbh2 to mea-
sure w = −1.28 ± 0.31, showing good consistency with
the ΛCDM cosmological model. Adding the cluster data
to CMB+H0+BAO+SNe improves the w constraint to
w = −1.023 ± 0.042.

The full cosmological power of the 2500 square-degree
SPT-SZ cluster survey has not yet been realized. A joint
analysis of the WtG and SPT-SZ cluster samples is cur-

In addition, weak-lensing ob-
servations of SPT-SZ discovered clusters themselves are
currently being analyzed and are expected to improve on
the 10% mass normalization uncertainty in this paper, in
turn sharpening the cosmological constraints. Especially
important is accurate knowledge of the mass scale over a
range of redshifts, which would speciﬁcally improve con-
straints on models of dark energy or modiﬁed gravity.

The SPT is presently reobserving a 500 square degree
patch of the SPT-SZ survey area with the polarization-
sensitive receiver SPTpol (Austermann et al. 2012).
While the primary science goals are related to polar-
ization, the greater map depth allows for a lower clus-
ter mass threshold, therefore extending the survey out
to higher redshift. The next receiver, SPT-3G (Benson
et al. 2014), is currently being built and will allow for
signiﬁcant progress in the SPT cluster program. The
SPT-3G receiver will have a mapping speed ∼20 times
higher than SPTpol, which should yield ∼5000 cluster
detections and, importantly, allow cluster mass calibra-
tion through CMB-cluster lensing (e.g., Seljak & Zaldar-
riaga 2000; Melin & Bartlett 2015; Baxter et al. 2015).
