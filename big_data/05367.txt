NULL-CONTROLLABILITY OF HYPOELLIPTIC QUADRATIC

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

KARINE BEAUCHARD, KAREL PRAVDA-STAROV

Abstract. We study the null-controllability of parabolic equations associated to a gen-
eral class of hypoelliptic quadratic diﬀerential operators. Quadratic diﬀerential operators
are operators deﬁned in the Weyl quantization by complex-valued quadratic symbols.
We consider in this work the class of accretive quadratic operators with zero singular
spaces. These possibly degenerate non-selfadjoint diﬀerential operators are known to
be hypoelliptic and to generate contraction semigroups which are smoothing in speciﬁc
Gelfand-Shilov spaces for any positive time. Thanks to this regularizing eﬀect, we prove
by adapting the Lebeau-Robbiano method that parabolic equations associated to these
operators are null-controllable in any positive time from control regions, for which null-
controllability is classically known to hold in the case of the heat equation on the whole
space. Some applications of this result are then given to the study of parabolic equations
associated to hypoelliptic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operators acting on weighted L2 spaces
with respect to invariant measures. By using the same strategy, we also establish the
null-controllability in any positive time from the same control regions for parabolic equa-
tions associated to any hypoelliptic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator acting on the ﬂat L2
space extending in particular the known results for the heat equation or the Kolmogorov
equation on the whole space.

1. Introduction

1.1. Null-controllability of degenerate parabolic equations. We aim in this work
at studying the null-controllability of parabolic equations controlled by a source term u
locally distributed on an open subset ω ⊂ Rn of the whole space
(1.1)

(cid:26) (∂t + P )f (t, x) = u(t, x)1lω(x) ,
f|t=0 = f0 ∈ L2(Rn),

where P = qw(x, Dx) is an accretive quadratic operator. Quadratic operators are pseudo-
diﬀerential operators deﬁned in the Weyl quantization

x ∈ Rn,

by symbols q(x, ξ), with (x, ξ) ∈ Rn × Rn, n ≥ 1, which are complex-valued quadratic
forms

These operators are non-selfadjoint diﬀerential operators with simple and fully explicit
expression since the Weyl quantization of the quadratic symbol xαξβ, with (α, β) ∈ N2n,

We study the null-controllability of the parabolic equations (1.1) associated to a general
class of hypoelliptic quadratic diﬀerential operators:

Deﬁnition 1.1 (Null-controllability). Let T > 0 and ω be an open subset of Rn. Equation
(1.1) is said to be null-controllable from the set ω in time T if, for any initial datum
f0 ∈ L2(Rn), there exists u ∈ L2((0, T ) × Rn), supported in [0, T ] × ω, such that the mild
solution of (1.1) satisﬁes f (T,·) = 0.

By the Hilbert Uniqueness Method, see [13, Theorem 2.44] or [37], the null-controllability

of the equation (1.1) is equivalent to the observability of the adjoint system

(1.3)

(cid:26) (∂t + P ∗)g(t, x) = 0 ,
g|t=0 = g0 ∈ L2(Rn).

x ∈ Rn ,

We recall that the notion of observability is deﬁned as follows:

Deﬁnition 1.2 (Observability). Let T > 0 and ω be an open subset of Rn. Equation (1.3)
is said to be observable in the set ω in time T if there exists a constant CT > 0 such that,
for any initial datum g0 ∈ L2(Rn), the mild solution of (1.3) satisﬁes
|g(t, x)|2dx(cid:17)dt .

An important open problem at the core of current investigations is to understand to
which extent the null-controllability (or observability) results known for uniformly para-
bolic equations still hold for degenerate parabolic equations of hypoelliptic type.

For equations posed on bounded domains, some progress have been made. In the case of
the heat equation on a bounded domain Ω with Dirichlet boundary conditions on ∂Ω, it is
well-known that observability holds in arbitrary positive time T > 0, with any non-empty
open set ω, see [21, Theorem 3.3], [22] and [36]. Degenerate parabolic equations exhibit
a wider range of behaviours. Indeed, observability may hold true, or not, depending on
the strength of the degeneracy. This feature is well understood for parabolic equations
that degenerate on the domain boundary, see [1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 39] in the one-dimensional
case, and [12] for the multi-dimensional one. Furthermore, a positive minimal time may
be required to get observability, see the works [4, 5] in the case of the Grushin equation,
[3] for the Heisenberg heat equation, and [2] for the Kolmogorov equation. This minimal
time is actually related to localization properties of eigenfunctions. Finally, a geometric
control condition may also be required for the observability inequality to hold [6].

On the other hand, the understanding of the null-controllability (or observability) for
degenerate parabolic equations of hypoelliptic type posed on the whole space is still at an
earlier stage. For the heat equation on the whole space

(1.5)

(∂t − ∆x) f (t, x) = u(t, x)1lω(x) ,

(t, x) ∈ (0, T ) × Rn,

no necessary and suﬃcient condition on the control region ω is known for null-controllability
to hold in any positive time. The condition

sup
x∈Rn

d(x, ω) < +∞,

is shown in [41, Theorem 1.11] to be necessary for null-controllability to hold in any
positive time. On the other hand, the following suﬃcient condition

∃δ, r > 0,∀y ∈ Rn ,∃y′ ∈ ω, B(y′, r) ⊂ ω and |y − y′| < δ ,

(1.6)
is given in [42] for null-controllability to hold from the open set ω ⊂ Rn in any positive
time. The very same condition is shown in [35] to be suﬃcient, when the observability set
ω = ωx × ωv has a Cartesian structure with ωx and ωv open sets both satisfying (1.6), for
the null-controllability of the Kolmogorov equation

(1.7)

(cid:26) (∂t + v · ∇x − ∆v)f (t, x) = u(t, x)1lω(x) ,
f|t=0 = f0 ∈ L2(Rn),

x ∈ Rn,

to hold in any positive time.

KARINE BEAUCHARD, KAREL PRAVDA-STAROV

As a ﬁrst result in this work (Theorem 1.3), we prove that condition (1.6) is actually

suﬃcient for the null-controllability of all hypoelliptic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equations
x ∈ Rn,

xf (t, x)] − hBx,∇xf (t, x)i = u(t, x)1lω(x) ,

(1.8)

(cid:26) ∂tf (t, x) − 1
2 Tr[Q∇2
f|t=0 = f0 ∈ L2(Rn),

where Q and B are real n × n-matrices satisfying the Kalman rank condition, with Q
symmetric positive semideﬁnite. This general result allows to recover in particular the
results of null-controllability for the heat equation and the Kolmogorov equation. Our
proof relies on an adaptation of the Lebeau-Robbiano strategy. Compared to the classi-
cal Lebeau-Robbiano method, the new diﬃculty in the present analysis is that the above
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups do not commute with the Fourier frequency cutoﬀ projec-
tions. In order to address this problem, we need to adapt the Lebeau-Robbiano strategy
by taking advantage of some key Gevrey smoothing properties of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
equations.

In the second part of this work, we prove that the parabolic equations (1.1) associated
to a general class of hypoelliptic quadratic operators are null-controllable from open sets
satisfying condition (1.6) in any positive time. More speciﬁcally, our main result (The-
orem 1.4) establishes that null-controllability holds for the parabolic equation (1.1), as
soon as the Weyl symbol q of the quadratic operator qw(x, Dx) has a non-negative real
part Re q ≥ 0 and a zero singular space S = {0}. The notion of singular space was
introduced in [27] by Hitrik and the second author by pointing out the existence of a
particular vector subspace in the phase space S ⊂ R2n, which is intrinsically associated to
a quadratic symbol q. As pointed out in [27, 30, 31, 44, 46, 47, 53], the notion of singular
space plays a basic role in the understanding of the spectral and hypoelliptic properties
of the (possibly) non-elliptic quadratic operator qw(x, Dx), as well as the spectral and
pseudospectral properties of certain classes of degenerate doubly characteristic pseudo-
diﬀerential operators [28, 29, 51, 52]. In particular, the work [27, Theorem 1.2.2] gives
a complete description for the spectrum of any non-elliptic quadratic operator qw(x, Dx)
whose Weyl symbol q has a non-negative real part Re q ≥ 0, and satisﬁes a condition of
partial ellipticity along its singular space S,

(x, ξ) ∈ S, q(x, ξ) = 0 ⇒ (x, ξ) = 0.

(1.9)
Under these assumptions, the spectrum of the quadratic operator qw(x, Dx) is shown to
be composed of a countable number of eigenvalues with ﬁnite algebraic multiplicities. The
structure of this spectrum is similar to the one known for elliptic quadratic operators [48].
This condition of partial ellipticity is generally weaker than the condition of ellipticity,
S ( R2n, and allows to deal with more degenerate situations. An important class of
quadratic operators satisfying condition (1.9) are those with zero singular spaces S = {0}.
In this case, the condition of partial ellipticity trivially holds. More speciﬁcally, these
quadratic operators have been shown in [46, Theorem 1.2.1] to be hypoelliptic and to
enjoy global subelliptic estimates of the type

∃C > 0,∀u ∈ S (Rn),

(1.10)
where h(x, Dx)i2 = 1 +|x|2 +|Dx|2, with a sharp loss of derivatives 0 ≤ δ < 1 with respect
to the elliptic case (case δ = 0), which can be explicitly derived from the structure of the
singular space. Our proof of null-controllability for the parabolic equation (1.1) associated

kh(x, Dx)i2(1−δ)ukL2 ≤ C(kqw(x, Dx)ukL2 + kukL2 ),

to a quadratic operator P = qw(x, Dx), whose Weyl symbol q has a non-negative real part
Re q ≥ 0 and a zero singular space S = {0}, relies on a similar adaptation of the Lebeau-
Robbiano strategy as the one devised for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equations (1.8). Contrary
to the case of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equations, the analysis of this class of quadratic op-
erators that are diﬀerential operators with variable coeﬃcients, cannot rely on a sole
frequency analysis on the Fourier side. We actually use some recent microlocal results on
the Gelfand-Shilov regularizing properties of the semigroups generated by these quadratic
operators together with a spectral inequality for Hermite functions (Proposition 3.2). As
for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equations, the main diﬃculty is that the above semigroups do not
necessarily commute with the projections onto Hermite functions. In order to address this
problem, we need to adapt the Lebeau-Robbiano strategy by taking advantage of some
key Gelfand-Shilov smoothing properties of these semigroups.

1.2. Miscellaneous facts about quadratic diﬀerential operators. Let qw(x, Dx) be
a quadratic operator deﬁned by the Weyl quantization (1.2) of a complex-valued quadratic
form q on the phase space R2n. The maximal closed realization of the quadratic operator
qw(x, Dx) on L2(Rn), that is, the operator equipped with the domain

(1.11)

D(qw) =(cid:8)g ∈ L2(Rn) : qw(x, Dx)g ∈ L2(Rn)(cid:9),

where qw(x, Dx)g is deﬁned in the distribution sense, is known to coincide with the graph
closure of its restriction to the Schwartz space [32] (pp. 425-426),

qw(x, Dx) : S (Rn) → S (Rn).
Classically, to any quadratic form deﬁned on the phase space

q : Rn

x × Rn

ξ → C,

is associated a matrix F ∈ M2n(C) called its Hamilton map, or its fundamental matrix,
which is deﬁned as the unique matrix satisfying the identity

(1.12)

∀(x, ξ) ∈ R2n,∀(y, η) ∈ R2n,

q((x, ξ), (y, η)) = σ((x, ξ), F (y, η)),

with q(·,·) the polarized form associated to the quadratic form q, where σ stands for the
standard symplectic form

(1.13)

σ((x, ξ), (y, η)) = hξ, yi − hx, ηi =

nXj=1
(ξjyj − xjηj),

with x = (x1, ..., xn), y = (y1, ...., yn), ξ = (ξ1, ..., ξn), η = (η1, ..., ηn) ∈ Cn. We observe

The notion of singular space introduced in [27] by Hitrik and the second author is deﬁned
as the following ﬁnite intersection of kernels

(1.14)

S =(cid:16) 2n−1\j=0

Ker(cid:2)Re F (Im F )j(cid:3)(cid:17) ∩ R2n,

where Re F and Im F stand respectively for the real and imaginary parts of the Hamilton
map F associated to the quadratic symbol q,

Re F =

1
2

(F + F ),

Im F =

1
2i

(F − F ).

When the quadratic symbol q has a non-negative real part Re q ≥ 0, the singular space
can be deﬁned in an equivalent way as the subspace in the phase space where all the
Poisson brackets

are vanishing

k ≥ 0,
ImqRe q)(X) = 0, k ≥ 0(cid:9).

This dynamical deﬁnition shows that the singular space corresponds exactly to the set of
points X ∈ R2n, where the real part of the symbol Re q under the ﬂow of the Hamilton
vector ﬁeld HImq associated to its imaginary part

(1.15)

t 7→ Re q(etHImq X),

vanishes to inﬁnite order at t = 0. This is also equivalent to the fact that the function
(1.15) is identically zero on R.

In this work, we study the class of quadratic operators whose Weyl symbols have non-
negative real parts Re q ≥ 0, and zero singular spaces S = {0}. According to the above
description of the singular space, these quadratic operators are exactly those whose Weyl
symbols have a non-negative real part Re q ≥ 0, becoming positive deﬁnite

In all the following, the terminology semigroup refers to strongly continuous one param-

sharpened and these contraction semigroups were shown to be actually smoothing for
any positive time in the Gelfand-Shilov space S1/2

integer satisfying

Ker(cid:2)Re F (Im F )j(cid:3)(cid:17) ∩ R2n = {0}.

As mentioned above, this Gelfand-Shilov regularizing property will be a key ingredient for
deriving observability estimates in Section 3.

A ﬁrst interesting example of an accretive quadratic operator with a zero singular space

Indeed, this operator writes as K = qw(x, v, Dx, Dv), where

q(x, v, ξ, η) = η2 +

is a non-elliptic complex-valued quadratic form with a non-negative real part, whose Hamil-

A simple algebraic computation shows that

Ker(Re F ) ∩ Ker(Re F Im F ) ∩ R4 = {0},

(1.20)
The singular space of q is therefore equal to zero S = {0}. For the Kramers-Fokker-Planck
operator, the integer 0 ≤ k0 ≤ 2n − 1 deﬁned in (1.18) with here n = 2, is equal to 1.
According to [46, Theorem 1.2.1], this integer 0 ≤ k0 ≤ 2n − 1 is directly related to
the loss of derivatives 0 ≤ δ = 2k0/(2k0 + 1) < 1 in the global subelliptic estimate (1.10)
satisﬁed by any quadratic operator whose Weyl symbol has a non-negative real part and a
zero singular space. The following examples show that this integer can actually take any
value in the set {0, ..., 2n − 1}, when n ≥ 1:

hA, Bi 6= hB, Ai in general, since e.g., h∇x, Bxi = hBx,∇xi + Tr(B).
We study degenerate hypoelliptic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operators when the symmetric
matrix Q is possibly not positive deﬁnite. These degenerate operators have been studied in
the recent works [7, 19, 20, 34, 38, 40, 45]. We recall from these works that the assumption
of hypoellipticity is classically characterized by the following equivalent assertions:

(i) The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator P is hypoelliptic
(ii) The symmetric positive semideﬁnite matrices

where L(X1, X2, ..., Xn, Y0)(x) denotes the Lie algebra generated by the vector
ﬁelds X1, X2, ..., Xn, Y0, at point x ∈ Rn

When the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator is hypoelliptic, that is, when one (equivalently,
all) of the above conditions holds, the associated Markov semigroup (T (t))t≥0 has the

The ﬁrst result contained in this work establishes the null-controllability of any hypoelliptic

any positive time:

Theorem 1.3. Let T > 0 and ω be an open subset of Rn satisfying (1.6). When the

ξ → C be a complex-valued quadratic form with a non
negative real part Re q ≥ 0, and a zero singular space S = {0}. If ω is an open subset of
Rn satisfying condition (1.6), then the parabolic equation

x × Rn

(cid:26) ∂tf (t, x) + qw(x, Dx)f (t, x) = u(t, x)1lω(x) ,
f|t=0 = f0 ∈ L2(Rn),

x ∈ Rn,

with qw(x, Dx) being the quadratic diﬀerential operator deﬁned by the Weyl quantization
of the symbol q, is null-controllable from the set ω in any positive time T > 0.

As ﬁrst examples of applications, we notice that Theorem 1.4 allows to establish the

null-controllability of the heat equation with a quadratic potential

(1.27)

(cid:0)∂t − ∆x + |x|2(cid:1) f (t, x) = u(t, x)1lω(x) ,

from any open control set satisfying condition (1.6) in any positive time. The result of
Theorem 1.4 also applies to the Kramers-Fokker-Planck equation (1.19):

when a ∈ R∗, from any open control set satisfying condition (1.6) in any positive time.
Since the L2(Rn)-adjoint of a quadratic operator (qw, D(qw)) is given by the quadratic
operator (qw, D(qw)), whose Weyl symbol is the complex conjugate of the symbol q, we
notice that the assumptions of Theorem 1.4 hold for the operator P = qw(x, Dx) if and
only if they hold for its L2(Rn)-adjoint operator P ∗ = qw(x, Dx). By using the Hilbert
Uniqueness Method [13] (Theorem 2.44), the result of null-controllability given by Theorem
1.4 is therefore equivalent to the following observability estimate:

Theorem 1.5. Let q : Rn
ξ → C be a complex-valued quadratic form with a non
negative real part Re q ≥ 0, and a zero singular space S = {0}. If ω is an open subset of

1.3.5. Outline of the work. Section 2 is devoted to the proof of null-controllability for
hypoelliptic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equations posed in the L2(Rn) space, whereas the proof
of observability for parabolic equations associated to accretive quadratic operators with
zero singular spaces is given in Section 3. Sections 4 and 5 are then devoted to the proofs
of null-controllability and observability for respectively hypoelliptic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
and Fokker-Planck equations posed in L2-spaces weighted by invariant measures. Section 6
provides an application of Theorems 1.4 and 1.5 for the study of a model of a two oscillators
chain coupled with two heat baths at each side. Section 7 is an appendix giving a proof
of a spectral inequality for Hermite functions used in Section 3 and a reminder about the
Gelfand-Shilov regularity.

2. Proof of null-controllability of hypoelliptic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck

equations

This section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.3. We begin by noticing that the

result of Theorem 1.3 is equivalent to the null-controllability of the equation

(2.1)

(cid:26) ∂tf − 1
f|t=0 = f0 ∈ L2(Rn),

2 Tr[Q∇2

xf ] − hBx,∇xfi − 1

2 Tr(B)f = u(t, x)1lω(x) ,

from the set ω in time T > 0, where ω is an open subset of Rn satisfying (1.6). We observe
that the L2(Rn)-adjoint of the operator

is given by

By using the Hilbert Uniqueness Method [13] (Theorem 2.44), the result of null-controllability
of the equation (2.1) is equivalent to the following observability estimate

(2.2)

with

∀T > 0,∃CT > 0,∀g ∈ L2(Rn),

˜P =

As the assumptions of Theorem 1.3 are fulﬁlled when interchanging B and −B, it is
therefore equivalent to prove the observability estimate (2.2) for the operator

˜P =

with Q and B real n × n matrices satisfying the assumptions of Theorem 1.3. On the
other hand, we notice that the operator ˜P = −qw(x, Dx) writes as the Weyl quantization
of the quadratic symbol

q(x, ξ) =

1
2hQ1/2ξ, Q1/2ξi − ihBx, ξi,

with h·,·i being the Euclidean scalar product on Rn, whose real part is non-negative.
As recalled above (see also e.g. [32]), the operator ˜P generates a contraction semigroup

In order to derive an explicit decay rate for the Fourier transform of this

When the Kalman rank condition holds

We use an adapted Lebeau-Robbiano direct approach for observability. To that end, we
use the results of exponential decay given by Proposition 2.2 and the following spectral
inequality proved by Le Rousseau and Moyano in [35, Theorem 3.1]:

Theorem 2.3. If ω is an open subset of Rn satisfying condition (1.6), then there exists a

3. Proof of observability of parabolic equations associated to accretive

quadratic operators with zero singular spaces

This section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.5. As in the previous section, we draw
our inspiration from the Lebeau-Robbiano strategy. Nevertheless, the Lebeau-Robbiano
method cannot be directly applied in its usual form as the (generalized) eigenfunctions
of accretive quadratic operators with zero singular spaces do not constitute in general
a L2-Hilbert basis. Contrary to the usual Lebeau-Robbiano strategy, the solutions are
therefore not expanded on the (generalized) eigenfunctions of the operator deﬁning the
parabolic equation, but in the L2-Hermite basis which is not diagonalizing the operator.
With this choice, the new diﬃculty is that the semigroup is not diagonal anymore in
the L2-Hermite basis, and even if a ﬁnite number of modes could be steered to zero
at some time, any passive control phase in the Lebeau-Robbiano method makes them
all revive again. To overcome this lack of commutation between semigroups and Hermite

24

KARINE BEAUCHARD, KAREL PRAVDA-STAROV

projection operators, we take a key advantage of the Gelfand-Shilov regularizing properties
of semigroups generated by accretive quadratic operators with zero singular spaces, and
the fact that Gelfand-Shilov regularity is characterized by a certain exponential decay of
the Hermite coeﬃcients.

Proposition 3.1. Let q : R2n
x,ξ → C be a quadratic form with a non-negative real part

Proof. Let q : R2n
x,ξ → C be a quadratic form with a non-negative real part Re q ≥ 0 and
a zero singular space S = {0}. We recall from [32, p. 426] that the quadratic operator
qw(x, Dx) obtained by the Weyl quantization of the symbol q is accretive and generates
a contraction semigroup on L2(Rn). We denote 0 ≤ k0 ≤ 2n − 1 the smallest integer
satisfying (1.18). In the work [31, Theorem 1.2], Hitrik, Viola and the second author have
shown that the contraction semigroup (e−tqw
)t≥0 is smoothing for any positive time in the
Gelfand-Shilov space S1/2

We refer the reader to the appendix (Section 7.2) for the deﬁnition and some characteri-
zations of the Gelfand-Shilov regularity. More speciﬁcally, we deduce from [31, Proposi-
tion 4.1] that there exist some positive constants C0 > 1 and t0 > 0 such that

6. Application: Null-controllability and observability of a chain of two

oscillators coupled to two heat baths at each side

This section is devoted to provide an application of the general results of null controlla-
bility and observability for accretive quadratic operators with zero singular spaces. This
example given in [44, Section 4.3] comes from the series of works [16, 17, 18, 25, 26]. It
is a model describing a chain of two oscillators coupled with two heat baths at each side.
The particles are described by their respective positions and velocities (xj, yj) ∈ R2d. For
each oscillator, the particles are submitted to an external force derived from a real-valued
potential Vj(xj) and a coupling between the two oscillators derived from a real-valued
potential Vc(x2 − x1). We denote the full potential

V (x) = V1(x1) + V2(x2) + Vc(x2 − x1),

x = (x1, x2) ∈ R2d,

y = (y1, y2) ∈ R2d the velocities and z = (z1, z2) ∈ R2d the variables describing the state
of the particles in each of the heat baths. In each bath, the particles are submitted to
a coupling with the nearest oscillator, a force given by the friction coeﬃcient γ and a
thermal diﬀusion at the temperature Tj. We denote w1, w2 two standard d-dimensional

7. Appendix

7.1. Spectral inequality for Hermite functions. This section is devoted to the proof
of a spectral inequality for Hermite functions. To that end, we use the following result
proved by Le Rousseau and Moyano in [35, Proposition 3.2]:

Proposition 7.1. (Weight function for elliptic Carleman estimate). Let S > 0, Q =
(0, S) × Rn and ω be an open subset of Rn satisfying (1.6). There exists a function
ψ ∈ C 3([0, S] × Rn; R+) such that
(7.1)

ψ ∈ W 3,∞([0, S] × Rn) ,

(7.2)

(7.3)

(7.4)

∀(s, x) ∈ Q,
∀x ∈ Rn \ ω,

|(∇s,xψ)(s, x)| ≥ C,

(∂sψ)|s=0 ≥ C,

(∂sψ)|s=S ≤ −C < 0 , ψ|s=S = 0 ,

with C > 0 being a positive constant.

In order to establish the spectral inequality for Hermite functions, we need to derive a

global Carleman estimate for the augmented elliptic operator
s − ∆x + |x|2,

eP = −∆s,x + |x|2 = −∂2

on the set Q = (0, S) × Rn.
Proposition 7.2. (Global elliptic Carleman estimate). Let ω be an open subset of Rn
satisfying (1.6) and ψ the weight function given by Proposition 7.1. With

ϕ(s, x) = exp(λψ(s, x)),

λ ≥ 1,

there exist some positive constants C > 0, τ0 ≥ 1 and λ0 ≥ 1 such that

L2(ω)),

with λ = λ0, for all τ ≥ τ0 and g ∈ C 2([0, S]; S (Rn, C)) verifying g|s=0 ≡ 0.

Proof. The proof of this result is a slight adaptation of the proof of Proposition 3.3 given
in [35]. Compared to the estimate appearing in [35] (Proposition 3.3), there are two
additional terms in the estimate (7.5) coming from the quadratic potential |x|2 in the
operator eP . More speciﬁcally, there is the extra term

L2(Q),

τkeτ ϕxgk2

appearing in the left-hand-side of the estimate (7.5) and the extra term

τ e2τk(xg)|s=Sk2

L2(Rn),

40

KARINE BEAUCHARD, KAREL PRAVDA-STAROV

appearing in its right-hand-side. To prove Proposition 7.2, we follow the very same strategy
as the one given in [35, Proposition 3.3]. In the following, we only emphasize the diﬀerences
between the two proofs.

We observe that eP = P + |x|2, where P denotes the operator appearing in the proof

given in [35, Proposition 3.3]. Keeping the very same notations as in [35], the conjugated
operator

can be written as

τ ≥ 1,

ePϕ = eτ ϕeP e−τ ϕ,
ePϕ = A + ieB,

with A = A1 + A2 + A3, eB = B1 + eB2, where the operators A1, A2, B1, eB2 are the same as
the ones deﬁned in [35, p. 3205], whereas the additional operator A3 is given by A3 = |x|2.
Let 0 < µ < 2 be positive parameter. Following [35, p. 3206], we next write

with B = B1+B2 and B2 = −iτ (1+µ)∆ϕ. For v ∈ C 2([0, S]; S (R, C)) verifying v|s=0 = 0,
by expanding the square of the norm

ePϕ + τ µ∆ϕ = A + iB,

we obtain from Proposition 7.1 that

kePϕv + τ µ∆ϕ vk2

L2(Q),

where the terms Ij,k are explicitly computed in [35, formulas (3.13) to (3.16)] for any
1 6 j, k 6 2. On the other hand, the new terms

are given by

I3,k = Re(A3v, iBkv)L2(Q),

1 6 k 6 2,

I3,2 = τ (1 + µ)ˆQ |xv|2∆s,xϕ dxds ,

I3,1 = 2τ Re(cid:16)ˆQ |x|2v(∂sϕ ∂sv + ∇xϕ · ∇xv)dxds(cid:17) = J3,1 + BT3,1,

with

J3,1 = −τ ˆQ |xv|2∂2

(7.7)

BT3,1 = τ ˆRn |xv|2∂sϕ|s=Sdx,
since v|s=0 = 0. Following [35], we deduce from (7.6) that

with eJ = J + J3,1 + I3,2, gBT = BT + BT3,1, where the terms J and BT are deﬁned in [35,

p. 3207]. We ﬁrst study the interior terms:

Interior terms. Following [35], we have

(7.9)

with

(τ 3γ0|v|2 + τ γ1|∇s,xv|2 + τ γ2|xv|2)dxds + eX ,

eJ = ˆQ
eX = X − 2τ ˆQ |v|2x · ∇xϕdxds,

γ2 = µ∆s,xϕ,

where the terms γ0, γ1 and X are deﬁned in [35, p. 3208]. It is established in [35, formula
(3.18)] that

(7.10)
when λ ≥ 1 is suﬃciently large. On the other hand, we deduce from (7.1) and (7.2) that

γ0 & λ4ϕ3,

γ1 & λ2ϕ,

γ2 = µ∆s,xϕ = µλ(∆s,xψ)ϕ + µλ2|∇s,xψ|2ϕ & λ2ϕ,

when λ ≥ 1 is suﬃciently large. It provides a new positive term in the left-hand side of
the estimate of the type

(7.11)

τ λ2ˆQ |xv|2ϕdxds ≥ τ λ2ˆQ |xv|2dxds,

since ϕ ≥ 1, as ψ ≥ 0. We observe from Proposition 7.1, (7.9), (7.10) and (7.11) that the
additional term in eX given by

−2τ ˆQ |v|2x · ∇xϕdxds = −2τ λˆQ |v|2x · (∇xψ)ϕdxds,

can be absorbed

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)2τ ˆQ |v|2x · ∇xϕdxds(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) . τ 1/2λˆQ |xv|2ϕdxds + τ 3/2λˆQ |v|2ϕdxds,

when the parameters λ and τ are suﬃciently large by the following positive term

ˆQ

(τ λ2|xv|2ϕ + τ 3λ4ϕ3|v|2)dxds,

since ϕ ≥ 1, appearing in the estimate from below of the term eJ. By taking advantage

of the estimate from below of the term J in [35, formula (3.19)] and by choosing the
parameter λ suﬃciently large (ﬁxed) and the parameter τ suﬃciently large (arbitrary), we
obtain that

(7.12)

We next study the boundary terms:

eJ & τ 3kvk2

L2(Q) + τk∇s,xvk2

L2(Q) + τkxvk2

L2(Q).

Boundary terms. It follows from Proposition 7.1 and (7.7) that

BT3,1 = τ λˆRn |xv|2∂sψ|s=Sdx & −τ λˆRn |(xv)|s=S|2dx,

42

KARINE BEAUCHARD, KAREL PRAVDA-STAROV

since ϕ|s=S = 1. Putting together this estimate and the lower bound on the term BT
given in [35, formula (3.23)], we obtain that there exist some positive constants C0, C1 > 0
such that for suﬃciently large values of the parameters λ ≥ 1 and τ ≥ 1,
(7.13) gBT ≥ C0(τ 3λ3kv|s=Sk2

L2(Rn) + τ λkϕ1/2∂sv|s=0k2

L2(Rn) + τ λk∂sv|s=Sk2

L2(Rn) + τ λkϕ1/2∂sv|s=0k2

− C1(τ λk∇xv|s=Sk2

L2(ω)).

By collecting the estimates (7.8), (7.12) and (7.13) obtained for the interior and boundary
terms, we deduce that

L2(Q) + τkxvk2
