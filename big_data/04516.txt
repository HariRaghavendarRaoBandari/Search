entanglement entropy is powerful tool in studying the properties of the holographic
phase transition. For the operator hO+i, we observe that the entanglement entropy
in 4-dimensional spacetime decreases in metal phase but changes non-monotonously
in superconducting phase with the increase of the ENE parameter. Interestingly, the
change of the entanglement entropy in 5-dimensional spacetime for both the phases
is monotonous as the ENE factor alters. For the operator hO−i, we show that the
behavior of entanglement entropy in four and ﬁve dimensions changes monotonously
for both phases as one tunes the strength of the ENE. Furthermore, for both the
operators the entanglement entropy in four or ﬁve dimensional black hole increases
with the increase of the width of the region.

The anti-de Sitter/ conformal ﬁeld theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence states that a
weak coupling gravity theory in a d-dimensional AdS spacetime can be related to a
strong CFT on the (d-1)-dimensional boundary [1, 2, 3]. Based on this novel idea,
the simplest example of the duality between the superconductor and gravity the-
ory was ﬁrst constructed in [4]. It was suggested that the Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS
(RN-AdS) black hole becomes unstable and ﬁnally the scalar hair brings spontaneous
U(1)-gauge symmetry breaking as one tunes the temperature for black hole. And
the RN-AdS and hair black holes correspond to a second order phase transition from
normal phase to superconducting phase. Since this prominent connection between
condensed matter and gravitational physics proved us a elegant approach to study the
strongly coupled condensed matter systems, a lot of the holographic superconductor
models have been widely studied in Refs.[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. On the other hand, the entanglement entropy is expect to be an
eﬀective measure of how a given quantum system is strongly correlated. In the spirit
of AdS/CFT correspondence, Ryu and Takayanagi [23, 24] have provided a geometric
proposal to compute the entanglement entropy of CFTs from the minimal area sur-
face in gravity side. Recently, this elegant approach has been applied extensively to
study various properties of holographic superconductors [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]
and it has been proven as a good probe to the critical phase transition point and the
order of phase transition [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41].

With these considerations in mind, we have studied the holographic entangle-
ment entropy in the phase transition for the Born-Infeld electrodynamics in Refs
[42, 43].
Interestingly enough, the Exponential nonlinear electrodynamics (ENE),
which was introduced by Hendi to obtain the new charged BTZ black hole solutions
in the Einstein nonlinear electromagnetic ﬁeld, is a new Born-Infeld-like nonlinear
electrodynamics[44, 45]. The Lagrangian density for the ENE theory is

LEN E =

− 1(cid:21),

(1.1)

F 2 = F µνFµν, where F µν is the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor. b is the Exponential
coupling parameter and this Lagrangian will reduce to the Maxwell case as the factor
b approaches zero. Compared to the Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics (BINE)
[46, 47, 48, 49, 50], the ENE displays diﬀerent eﬀect on the on the electric potential
and temperature for the same parameters and its singularity is much weaker than
the Einstein-Maxwell theory [51, 52, 53, 54]. Therefore it is of great interesting to
see the phase transition in the frame of the ENE theory, in particular, to see how
the entanglement entropy changes as the strength of the ENE changes.

In the present paper, we would like to investigate the behavior of entanglement
entropy in the metal/superconductor phase transition with Exponential nonlinear
electrodynamics to examine whether the holographic entanglement entropy is still
useful in describing properties of the phase transition system. In the 4-dimensional
spacetime, we observe that the entanglement entropy decreases in the metal phase
for both operators as the ENE factor becomes larger. In the superconducting phase,
however, with the increase of the ENE factor, the entanglement entropy of the oper-
ator hO−i increases monotonously but the entanglement entropy ﬁrst increases and
then decreases continuously for the operator hO+i. Considering the higher dimen-
sion, interestingly enough, we note that with the increase of the ENE parameter the
value of the entanglement entropy increases monotonously in 5-dimensional space-
time for the two operators in the superconducting phase. While the entanglement
entropy in the normal phase decreases as the ENE factor becomes larger. We also
note that the slope of entanglement entropy in four and ﬁve dimensional spacetimes
presents a discontinuous change at a critical temperatures which implies a signiﬁcant
reorganization of the degrees of freedom of the system due to the process of phase
transition. Furthermore, the jump of the slope of the entanglement entropy can be
regarded as the signature of the second order phase transition.

The structure of this work is as follows.

In section II, we will introduce the
holographic superconductor model with ENE theory and study the properties of
holographic phase transition by examining in detail the scalar operator. In section
III, we will investigate the holographic entanglement entropy of the phase transition
system in four and ﬁve dimensional spacetimes, respectively. In section V, we will
summarize our results.

2.2 Physical properties of phase transition

We now study the physical properties of phase transition in this model through the
behaviors of the scalar condensation. In order to obtain the solutions in metal phase,
we set the function ψ(r) = 0 and the solution of the system is just the black hole with
exponential form of nonlinear electrodynamics. However, the equations are nonlinear
and coupled to each other in the superconducting phase where ψ(r) 6= 0. Therefore,
we solve these equations by using the numerical shooting method. Introducing a new
variable z = r+/r, then the region r+ < r < ∞ correspondences to 1 > z > 0. In
the following, we will work in the phase transition of the complex model and study
the eﬀects of the ENE parameter b on the condensation of the scalar operators in
d-dimensional spacetime. And the useful dimensionless quantities are

Firstly, we concretely investigate the phase transition for ENE ﬁeld with full

backreaction in the 4-dimensional AdS black hole spacetime. Considering Breitenlohner-
Freedman bound[56], we here set m2 = −2 and q = 1. The scalar operator as a
function of temperature with diﬀerent values of ENE parameter is shown in Fig. 1.
In the left panel, it is shown that the operator hO+i emerges at critical temperature
Tc, which implies the phase transition appears. The critical behavior near Tc is found
2 , which represents the transition is second order. It should
to be hO+i ∝ (1− T /Tc)
be noted that the value of the critical temperature Tc becomes smaller as the ENE
factor b increases, which means that the ENE correction to the usual Maxwell ﬁeld
makes the scalar hair harder to form in the full-backreaction model. Furthermore,
for a given b ,the critical temperature Tc of the ENE system is smaller than that
of the BINE system which was studied in Ref.[43]. That is to say, the scalar hair
is more diﬃcult to be develop in a model with ENE than that with BIEN. For the
operator hO−i (right plot), we also ﬁnd that there is a phase transition at the critical
temperature Tc. And the critical temperature Tc decreases with the increase of the
parameter b. As the factor b approaches to zero, our result is consistent with the
result in Ref. [55].

observe that when the temperature decreases to be lower than the critical value Tc,
the condensation of the operator hO+i appears and this tells us that the scalar hair
forms. Interestingly, with the increase of the ENE factor b, the value of the critical
temperature Tc decreases. This means that the ENE correction to the usual Maxwell
ﬁeld hinders the formation of the scalar condensation in this system. In the right-

3. Holographic entanglement entropy of the transition system

In this section, we will concentrate on the holographic entanglement entropy of the
holographic model. A simple and elegant proposal to entanglement entropy of the
boundary ﬁeld theory in the context of gauge/gravity duality has been presented in
Refs.[23, 24]. It is explicitly given by the formula

SA =

Area(γA)

4GN

,

(3.1)

where SA is the entanglement entropy for the subsystem A which can be chosen
arbitrarily, γA is the minimal area surface in the bulk which ends on the boundary
of A, GN is Newton constant in the Einstein gravity on the AdS space. Here, we
consider the entanglement entropy for a strip geometry in d-dimensional spacetime
and study the behavior of holographic entanglement entropy in this transition system.

3.1 Holographic entanglement entropy in 4-dimensional spacetime

We ﬁrst explore the inﬂuence of the ENE electrodynamics on the entanglement en-
tropy by the holographic method in 4-dimensional spacetime. Considering the en-
tanglement entropy for a strip geometry corresponding to a subsystem A which is
described by− ℓ

II, the above physical quantities s and ℓ under the Eq. (2.11) can be rescaled as
, ℓ → α−ℓ. Consequently, we can use these scale invariants in the following

calculation

s/√ρ , ℓ√ρ.

(3.4)

The behavior of the entanglement entropy of the operator hO+i as a function of
temperature T and the nonlinear factor b with ℓ√ρ = 1 is presented in Fig. 3. The
vertical dashed lines represent the critical temperature of the phase transition for
each b. The dot-dashed lines are from the normal phase and the solid ones are from
the superconducting cases. It is found that the entanglement entropy as a function of
temperate has a discontinuous slop at the critical temperature Tc. Which indicates
that some kind of new degrees of freedom like the Cooper pairs would appear in
new phase. And this discontinuity corresponds to second order phase transition in
the holographic model with ENE. Therefore, the entanglement entropy is useful in
disclosing the holographic pase transition, and that its behavior can indicate not
only the appearance, but also the order of the phase transition.

Moreover, the entanglement entropy after condensate is lower than the one in the
metal phase and decreases monotonously as temperature decreases. It means that
the condensate turns on at the critical temperature and the formation of Cooper pairs
make the degrees of freedom decrease in the hair phase. For a given T , the value
of the entanglement entropy becomes smaller as the ENE factor b increases in the
normal phase. In the superconducting phase, however, the entanglement entropy ﬁrst
increases (left plot)and then decreases monotonously (right plot) as the parameter b
becomes larger.

For the operator hO−i, interestingly, the dependence of the entanglement entropy
on the factor b is monotonic in the hair phase which is displayed in Fig. 4. It also can
be seen from the picture that the value of the entanglement entropy in metal phase
decreases with the increase of the parameter b. Furthermore, the value of the critical
temperature Tc decreases as we choose a lager b. Comparing with the results in Fig.
1, we mention that the entanglement entropy is more sensitive to the change of the
nonlinear parameter b than the scalar operator, which provide us a better approach
to detect the eﬀects of exponential nonlinear electrodynamics.

Next, for the sake of studying the eﬀect of strip width ℓ on the entanglement
entropy in the superconducting phase, we plot in Figs. 5 and 6 that the behavior

the ﬁrst term 1/ε2 is divergent as ε → 0. The second term is independent of the cutoﬀ
and is ﬁnite, so it is physical important. Now, we can calculate the entanglement
entropy of the operators hO−i and hO+i and explore the eﬀects of the temperature
T , the ENE factor b and the belt width ℓ on the entanglement entropy respectively.
The behavior of the entanglement entropy for the various factors is show in Fig.
3 . The vertical dotted lines rep-
7 in the dimensionless quantities s/ρ
resent the critical temperature of the phase transition for the diﬀerent value of the
ENE factor. The dot-dashed line is for the normal phase and the solid one is for
the superconductor solutions. For both operators, the behavior of the entanglement
entropy with respect of the temperature is similar to the case of the 4-dimensional
spacetime which is studied in section III. Which means the entanglement entropy is
also a good probe to the holographic phase transition in higher dimensional space-
time of this model. When the factor T is ﬁxed, for two operators we ﬁnd that the
entanglement entropy decreases (or increases) with the increase of the ENE factor b
in the normal (or hair) phase. Furthermore, it is of interesting to note that the slope
of the curve decreases as the temperature is lowered in superconductor situation.
And the inﬂuence of the ENE parameter b on the entanglement entropy is getting
smaller as we choose a low temperature.

To get further understanding of the eﬀect of the width ℓ on the entanglement
entropy in the hair phase, we plot the corresponding results in Fig. 8 with b = 0.4.
For the operator hO+i presented in the left-hand panel, we ﬁnd that with the increase
of the factor ℓ the value of the entanglement entropy increases. From the right panel,
we can see that the behavior of the entanglement entropy for the operator hO−i with
respect of the width ℓ is similar to the case of the operator hO+i.

4. Summary

We studied the phase transition and the behavior of entanglement entropy in AdS
black hole gravity with ENE in four and ﬁve dimensional spacetimes. Firstly, we
revealed the properties of the phase transition by analyzing the behaviors of the
scalar hair. It was found that the scalar hair emerges at critical temperature T = Tc,
which implies the phase transition appears. With the increase of the ENE factor b,
the value of the critical temperature Tc becomes smaller. That is to say, the ENE
correction to the usual Maxwell ﬁeld makes the scalar hair harder to form in the
full-backreaction model.

More importantly, we investigated the holographic entanglement entropy of the
holographic model. For the 4-dimensional spacetime, we observed that the holo-
graphic entanglement entropy as a function of temperate has a discontinuous slop at
the critical temperature Tc. And this jump of the slop of the entanglement entropy
discontinuity corresponds to second order phase transition in the holographic model

with exponential nonlinear electrodynamics. Moreover, the entanglement entropy af-
ter condensate is lower than the one in the metal phase and decreases monotonously
as temperature decreases. This is due to the fact that the formation of Cooper pairs
make the degrees of freedom decrease in the hair phase. For a ﬁxed T, we can see
that the entanglement entropy of the operator hO+i and operator hO−i in the normal
phase becomes smaller as the ENE factor b increases. In the superconducting phase,
however, it is surprising that the inﬂuence of the parameter b on the entanglement
entropy of the operator hO+i is non-monotonic. We found that for the both operators
the entanglement entropy increases with the increase of the width of the region.

We also explored the holographic entanglement entropy of the holographic model
in 5-dimensional spacetime and observed that the behave of the entanglement entropy
as a function of the temperature is similar to the case of the 4-dimensional spacetime.
Furthermore, it was of interesting to note that the slope of the curve decreases as the
temperature is lowered in superconductor situation. For a given T, we found that the
entanglement entropy of two operators decreases in the metal phase but increases in
the hair phase as we choose a larger ENE factor. We also observed that the eﬀect
of the ENE factor on the entanglement entropy is getting smaller as we choose a
low temperature in the superconducting phase, and the value of the entanglement
entropy becomes bigger as the width of the region increases.
