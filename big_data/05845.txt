Abstract

In the present thesis I studied the particle phenomenology and cosmology arising
from a class of string models called sequestered compactiﬁcations, which were born
with the aim of getting low-energy SUSY from strings. This is not an easy task if
combined with cosmological constraints, since the mechanism of moduli stabilization
ﬁxes both the scale of supersymmetric particles and the scale of moduli, which tend
to be of the same order. However, if on the one hand supersymmetric particles with
TeV mass are desired in order to address the electroweak hierarchy problem, on the
other hand the cosmological moduli problem requires the moduli to be heavier than
100 TeV. The speciﬁc setup of sequestered compactiﬁcations makes this hierarchy
achievable, at least in principle: as in these models the visible sector is located
on a stack of D3-branes at singularities, a physical separation between the visible
degrees of freedom and the SUSY-breaking sources takes place. Such decoupling
translates into a hierarchy between the scale of SUSY-breaking and the spectrum
of supersymmetric particles. Moreover, it is interesting to notice that moduli are
the four-dimensional manifestation of the existence of extra-dimensions, and then
their presence is a common feature of all string compactiﬁcations. Since they are
only gravitationally coupled, they could decay late in the history of the universe,
aﬀecting in a signiﬁcant way its cosmological evolution. Possible deviations of the
cosmological observables from the values predicted by the standard Hot Big Bang
Theory constitute an interesting alternative for the discovery of new physics beyond
the Standard Model, which is complementary to the particle physics search. For this
reason in addition to SUSY-breaking in sequestered models, I also studied several
cosmological scenarios arising from them, such as production of non-thermal dark
matter and dark radiation, reheating from moduli decay and inﬂation.

State of the Art

The higgs boson has been for a long time the last missing block of the Standard
Model of particle physics (in the following Standard Model or SM) [5]. With the an-
nouncement of the discovery of a new particle in 2012 [6, 7], whose mass is around
125 GeV and whose quantum numbers are compatible with those of the theorized
higgs boson [8], the scientiﬁc community ﬁnally celebrated the complete aﬃrmation
of this theory. The Standard Model describes all known particles1 and their inter-
actions through three out of the four known forces in nature: the electromagnetic
force, the weak force and the strong force. Fermionic particles compose the so-called
matter of the universe, and are called leptons and quarks. They are organized in
three diﬀerent families, of which the ﬁrst one contains the lightest and stable par-
ticles, such as the electron. Forces are mediated by bosonic particles called gauge
bosons: photon, gluons and the bosons W ± and Z.

The Standard Model is an extraordinarily successful scientiﬁc theory: to the
extent that we can compute physical quantities to make predictions which can be
experimentally veriﬁed, it has passed every single test. To give an idea of the
amazing agreement between Standard Model predictions and experimental data, in
Tab. 1.1 we report measured and predicted values for the masses of the W ± and Z
bosons, which highlight an impressive accord [5].

In order to locate the Standard Model within a wider scientiﬁc context, it is
worth recalling that it represents a speciﬁc example of a general tool, called quan-
tum ﬁeld theory, which allows to describe the physics of relativistic particles at the
quantum level. Quantum ﬁeld theory represents one of the two main pillars on which
the whole understanding of the universe is currently based, and it is useful to de-

1Except massive neutrinos.

scribe the physics taking place at small distances: in particular the Standard Model
describes the physics up to 10−17 cm. On the other hand, the second main pillar
is General Relativity [10], which describes at the classical level the fourth force of
nature: gravity. Given the weakness of the force of gravity, which becomes relevant
only when extremely large amounts of mass are taken into account, General Rela-
tivity is useful to describe the physics involving the largest scales of the universe.
The agreement between predictions of General Relativity and experiments has been
tested to a high degree of accuracy [11].

The Standard Model supplemented by General Relativity is commonly inter-
preted as an Eﬀective Field Theory (EFT) which is valid up to the energies explored
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) outside Geneve (MEW ∼ 100 GeV). To be pre-
cise, the description provided by the Standard Model is expected to break down
not far beyond the electroweak scale MEW, while the eﬀective description of gravity
provided by General Relativity is supposed to be a valid approximation all the way
up to the Planck scale MP ∼ 1018 GeV (or some other cut-oﬀ scale below MP at
which the four-dimensional description of General Relativity ceases to be valid, as it
happens for example in theories with extra-dimensions). As we will see in the next
sections, there are many good arguments in support of the idea that new physics
should appear at energies just above MEW.

According to the Hot Big Bang Theory, in its early stage the universe was com-
posed by a hot and dense thermal bath of relativistic particles, whose temperature
decreased following its expansion. As the temperature of the thermal bath can be
put in correspondence with the age of the universe, it turns out that the electroweak
energy scale MEW corresponds to a tiny age: tEW = 2×10−11 sec. As a consequence,
the EFT composed by General Relativity plus the Standard Model is perfectly suit-
able to describe the evolution of the entire universe from a tiny fraction of a second
after the Big Bang (tEW) to the present. The Hot Big Bang Theory is the cosmo-
logical counterpart of the Standard Model of particle physics.

4

Despite its outstanding success, the Standard Model (and consequently also the
Hot Big Bang Theory) is deﬁnitely incomplete, since at least it fails to describe
gravity at the quantum level. More in detail, there are two main gaps which have
to be ﬁlled in order to get a comprehensive understanding of the physics governing
the universe. On the one hand, the ﬁrst and more fundamental gap is the absence
of a quantum theory of gravity. Quantum gravitational eﬀects become important
either when a big amount of energy density is conﬁned in a small region of space
(as in black holes or in the universe at tP (cid:39) 10−44 sec), or when the physics taking
place at the smallest distances (cid:96)P (cid:39) 10−34 cm is considered2. The second gap on
the other hand, is the lack of comprehension of the physics taking place between
MEW and MP, which however should be consistently described in the framework of
quantum ﬁeld theory. From a cosmological point of view this second gap translates
into a lack of understanding of the evolution of the universe before tEW. Hopefully,
very soon new experimental data coming from the second run of the LHC will cut
through the fog, driving us towards the right way among the myriads of alternatives
available at the moment for the physics beyond the Standard Model.

There are a few main principles which have played a role of guidance in the
development of the current understanding of the universe, and that are extensively
used also in the investigation for new physics. The ﬁrst one is the principle of ne-
cessity. As we remarked above, Standard Model is a speciﬁc example of a more
general tool: quantum ﬁeld theory, whose birth is exactly due to the necessity of
unifying quantum mechanics and special relativity into a single framework. Indeed,
quantum mechanics is not able to describe relativistic particles, since it does not
provide the possibility of creating and/or annihilating particles, which is instead
allowed by the equivalence between energy and mass of special relativity, along with
the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Similarly, a conceptual obstruction is en-
countered as soon as one tries to formulate a quantum version of General Relativity,
since the prescriptions dictated by quantum ﬁeld theory to quantize it lead to a non-
renormalizable theory [12, 13]. Given that this obstacle appears to be unavoidable,
it suggests that probably a completely new tool is needed exactly in the same way
as quantum ﬁeld theory was needed in order to describe relativistic particles. As we
will explain in more detail in Sec. 1.3, the only known candidate theory providing a
description of gravity at the quantum level, and containing all the building blocks
of the Standard Model, is string theory [14, 15, 16, 17, 18].

2As mentioned before, the description of General Relativity can actually break down at distances

larger than (cid:96)P.

5

The second principle comes out from a very intuitive observation: physical phe-
nomena taking place at diﬀerent length scales (which correspond to diﬀerent energy
scales) do not aﬀect each other. This is a quite obvious point, since clearly it is
not necessary to understand quantum mechanics in order to play ping-pong, as well
as it is not needed to appreciate the dynamics of quarks within nuclei in order to
study the chemical features of a material. Physical phenomena operating at diﬀer-
ent energy scales simply decouple from each other. This concept is ubiquitous in
physics at every level of complexity, and it is often referred to as naturalness. The
naturalness principle is also incorporated in quantum ﬁeld theory [19, 20, 21], in
which context for instance the authors of [22] were able to predict the mass of the
charm quark, only by using naturalness arguments. This idea is strictly related to
that of eﬀective ﬁeld theory: let us assume to know the renormalizable lagrangian of
an eﬀective theory, like for instance the Standard Model. It is possible to compute
loop corrections to the parameters of the lagrangian (e.g. the masses of particles),
as a function of the cut-oﬀ Λ. The energy scale at which the corrections get larger
than the measured values of some of the parameters deﬁnes ΛUV: at this scale either
some degree of ﬁne-tuning is needed in order to cancel oﬀ diﬀerent loop contributions
and keep the values of the parameters equal to the measured ones, or new physics
intervenes, altering the low-energy description. The latter option is the natural one,
and it essentially relies on some underlying symmetry of the complete theory, which
keeps the corrections small. This idea works perfectly well in the Standard Model -
where for instance the chiral symmetry keeps fermionic masses small - with a single
major exception: the higgs mass. Such a breakdown is due to the generic UV sensi-
tivity of scalar particles, and it is a further reason to consider the Standard Model
unsatisfactory. Naturalness has probably been the main guidance principle in the
search for new physics beyond the electroweak scale MEW in the last decades.

Strictly related to the idea of naturalness, there is the problem of hierarchies
of the fundamental scales of nature, also known as Dirac’s naturalness. This issue
arises as a consequence of simple dimensional analysis in physics, according to which
dimensionless quantities should be of order one. Such a problem was ﬁrst noticed by
Dirac, who was interested in understanding the origin of the hierarchy between the
proton mass and the Planck mass: mproton/MP ∼ 10−18. It is commonly accepted
that every time dimensional analysis dramatically fails to predict the ratio between
two scales of nature, the hierarchy should be explained in a dynamical way. In the

6

particular case at hand the solution is asymptotic freedom of QCD, which gives

other hand the hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale

(1.2)

still needs an explanation.

Finally, it is worth mentioning a trend which is manifest in the development of
physics in the last century. Starting from the uniﬁcation of electricity and mag-
netism into a single description through Maxwell’s equations [23], to end with the
uniﬁcation of weak and electromagnetic forces in the Standard Model, it is possible
to recognize a general tendency pointing towards the uniﬁcation of the interactions
described in the quantum ﬁeld theory framework4. This observation is also reinforced
by noting that the Renormalization Group evolution of the coupling constants of
the Standard Model makes them qualitatively converge towards a single value at
high energies. This could imply that at high energies, such as in the primordial uni-
verse, the forces are indistinguishable and they get diﬀerentiated through various
symmetry breaking steps, the last one of which takes place at MEW leaving us with
the unbroken electromagnetism. This observation has been deeply exploited in the
search for new physics, in order to ﬁll the gap between MEW and MP.

In the present chapter we ﬁrst give a brief description of the state of the art,
both in particle physics and in cosmology, in Sec. 1.1. Afterwards we describe the
possible alternatives for the physics beyond the current understanding in Sec. 1.2,
focusing specially on the role played by supersymmetric theories. Finally we report
a brief introduction to the main concepts of string theory in Sec. 1.3.

1.1 Current Understanding

1.1.1 Standard Model of Particle Physics

The Standard Model of particle physics [5] is a quantum ﬁeld theory based on the
gauge group

GSM = SU (3)col × SU (2)L × U (1)Y .

(1.3)

The gauge theory based on SU (3)col describes strong interactions and it is called
Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD), while the SU (2)L×U (1)Y component describes
electroweak (EW) interactions. Matter particles are organized in three families of
quarks and leptons, as summarized in Tab. 1.2, transforming under the gauge groups
as reported in Tab. 1.3.

since they do not exist in free-states. The bounds on neutrino masses can be sharp-
ened by making assumptions on the nature of their mass terms.

The most interesting feature of the strong sector is asymptotic freedom, which
explains the hierarchy in eq. (1.1). The coupling constant of strong interactions

ΛQCD (cid:39) 200 MeV [5]. In the limit Q2 → ∞ the strong coupling constant vanishes,
giving rise to asymptotic freedom. At low Q2 on the other hand, QCD is in the
strong regime and quarks are constrained to form bound states called hadrons, such
as the proton, the pions, etc..

The dynamics of the electroweak sector is much more involved than that of the
strong one. SM is a chiral theory, i.e.
left and right components of the fermionic
ﬁelds transform diﬀerently under the gauge groups, as it can be observed in Tab. 1.3.
The chiral nature of the SM interactions is reﬂected in the fact that mass terms are
forbidden for all the fermions of the theory as a consequence of gauge invariance.
The higgs ﬁeld is a complex ﬁeld transforming as a doublet under SU (2)L and its

SU (2)L × U (1)Y → U (1)EM .

The ElectroWeak Symmetry Breaking mechanism (EWSB) is also called higgs mech-

(1.9)

where v = 170 GeV, while yf is an eigenvalue of the proper Yukawa matrix among
those appearing in eq. (1.8).

The Yukawa couplings in eq. (1.8) are the most general compatibly with gauge
invariance and renormalizability, and they feature an accidental invariance under
the global symmetries baryon number B and lepton number L. A clear manifes-
tation of the conservation of the baryon number is the proton lifetime, which is
constrained by the Kamiokande experiment to be τproton > 1032 − 1033 years [24],

10

while lepton number conservation5 puts a strict bound on processes such as µ → eγ,
whose branching ratio is currently Br(µ → eγ) < 5.7× 10−13 [25]. The hypercharge
assignments of Tab. 1.3 are dictated by anomaly cancellation.

A crucial point in the phenomenology of the SM is that the ﬁelds enumerated in
Tab. 1.3 form a basis of gauge eigenstates, which does not diagonalize the mass ma-
trices obtained through the Yukawa couplings in eq. (1.8). In order to get the mass
eigenstates it is necessary to diagonalize them by unitary transformations V U,D,L

and produces a mixing of the quark ﬂavors. On the other hand the CKM matrix
does not appear in the couplings of the Z boson with quarks, which implies the
absence of ﬂavour-changing neutral currents. A similar mixing does not happen in
the lepton sector of the SM, as a consequence of the fact that neutrinos are massless.
The CKM matrix has complex entries, but many of them can be eliminated by re-
parametrization of the ﬁelds. Eventually a single phase turns out to be physical,
producing CP-violation in the SM. A second source of CP-violation is the θ-term

Lθ =

θ
32π2 Gµν

˜Gµν ,

(1.11)

which can be added to the SM lagrangian, where Gµν is the ﬁeld strength of QCD.
Although this term is a total derivative, it can contribute to physical processes
through gauge instantons. Since it would give a contribution to the electric dipole
moment of the neutron, which is highly constrained, the value of θ has to be minus-
cule: θ < 10−10. This unexplained high degree of ﬁne-tuning required to match the
experimental data is known as Strong CP Problem.

cosmology is based on the Standard Model of particle physics supplemented by

The Standard Model of cosmology [26], also called Hot Big Bang Theory, assumes
that the universe started in a hot and dense state. As the universe expanded, the
thermal bath cooled and progressively became less dense. One of the most exciting
discoveries in cosmology dates back to 1998, when two independent projects [27, 28]
observed that the universe is currently expanding at an accelerate rate. The basic
observation about the universe is that it is isotropic and homogeneous at large spatial
scales, above the size of the largest observed structures i.e. supercluster of galaxies,
which can reach a diameter of tens of Megaparsec [29]. As the observations suggest
that space is essentially ﬂat [30], isotropy and homogeneity allow us to write the
metric of the expanding universe as

ds2 = dt2 − a2(t)dx2 ,

(1.15)

which is called Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric7. The entire dynamics
of the universe is described by the evolution of the time-dependent scale factor a(t).
Since the universe expands, a(t) is an increasing monotonic function of the time.

6We neglect the cosmological constant here.
7The FRW in eq. (1.15) is written in the case of ﬂat universe.

12

The rate of expansion is written in terms of the Hubble parameter

reciprocal of the current values of the Hubble constant gives an estimate of the age
of the universe, which is approximately t0 = H−1

0 (cid:39) 14 × 109 yrs.

Depending on the source of energy which dominates the universe in a given

epoch, the scale factor has a diﬀerent time-dependence, as reported in Tab. 1.4.

included a contribution ρcurv due to the curvature of the universe, to be as generic
as possible, even if observations show that it is negligibly small [30]. In terms of the

A few observations about eq. (1.21) are in order. First, at the current epoch the
various components sum up exactly to one. The second observation is that from
the scaling of the diﬀerent sources of energy density, it is possible to understand the
sequence of the dominating ones. At the very early stages of the universe, when
a (cid:28) a0, radiation dominated. Subsequently matter started to dominate at the age
tmatter = 105 yrs. The vacuum energy, also called Cosmological Constant Λ, has
started his period of domination very late, at the age of tΛ (cid:39) 7 × 109 yrs. The
parameters Ωi represent the current fractions of the energy density, which are

Ωradiation ≈ 5 × 10−5 , Ωmatter (cid:39) 0.27 , ΩΛ (cid:39) 0.73 ,

|Ωcurv| < 0.005 ,

(1.22)

so that the universe is currently dominated by the Cosmological Constant Λ, with
a minor contribution from matter, divided into baryonic matter and Dark Matter
(DM) in the following proportions

Ωbaryons (cid:39) 0.046 ,

ΩDM (cid:39) 0.23 .

(1.23)

DM is presumably composed by stable massive particles not included in the
SM, which do not interact electromagnetically and strongly. These compose clumps
of energy density which account for most of the mass of galaxies and clusters of
galaxies. There are several experimental evidences for DM existence, which also
provide estimates for its abundance, namely

1. Accurate reconstructions of the mass distributions in clusters of galaxies is
obtained through the observations of gravitational lensing of the light coming
from further galaxies [31, 32].

2. X-ray observations of clusters just after their collisions show that most of

14

baryons are in a hot, ionized intergalactic gas. The total mass of clusters
exceeds the mass of baryons in luminous matter by an order of magnitude [33].

3. The study of the motion of stars at the periphery of galaxies gives further
motivations for DM. Assuming circular motion, the dependence of the velocity
v(R) on the distance R from galactic center follows the Newton’s law

(cid:114)

v(R) =

GM (R)

R

.

(1.24)

Observationally, v(R) = const. suﬃciently far away from the center, and this
deviation from the expectations can be explained by assuming that luminous
matter is embedded into dark clouds of larger size [34].

4. Another possibility is to measure the speed of galaxies in galactic clusters and
use the virial theorem to infer the gravitational potential and hence the total
mass in the cluster itself. It turns out that the estimated total mass by far
exceeds the sum of masses of individual galaxies in clusters. This discrepancy
can be explained if most of the mass is due to DM which is distributed smoothly
over the cluster.

The presence of DM in the universe is quite important for our own existence,
since without it the universe today would still be pretty homogeneous, and as a
consequence large scale structures (like galaxies and clusters of galaxies) would have
never formed. DM can be of three diﬀerent types, depending on the mass mDM
of the particles which compose it: if mDM > 30 KeV it is called Cold Dark Matter
(CDM), while if mDM = 1 − 10 KeV then it is called Warm Dark Matter (WDM),
if mDM < 1 KeV it is called Hot Dark Matter (HDM). In the present thesis we will
deal with CDM. In this case, one of the best candidates for DM is represented by
Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP’s). In fact the abundance of DM is
roughly given by9

≈ (cid:104)σv(cid:105)−1 ,

ρDM
s0

(1.25)

where ρDM is the energy density of DM, s0 is the current value of the density of
entropy and (cid:104)σv(cid:105) is the annihilation cross section for DM particles. If the annihi-
lation cross section is of the same order of magnitude as that of weakly interacting

9The entropy density s is often used to measure the number of particles Ni of a given particle
species in a comoving volume, since in case of entropy conservation s ∼ a−3, and then Ni = ni/s,
where ni is the number density of particles.

15

particles (cid:104)σv(cid:105) ∼ 10−8 GeV−2, the abundance of DM roughly matches the observed
value. This observation is usually called the WIMP miracle.

The estimate in eq. (1.25) contains a concept which is fundamental in the un-
derstanding of the thermal history of the universe: as the expansion of the universe
H equals the rate of interaction of a given particle Γ then the particle freezes-out,
decoupling from the thermal bath. This concept is useful to determine the abun-
dance of CDM, as well as for instance the epoch of neutrino decoupling.

The standard cosmological model which includes CDM and dark energy with
abundances close to those reported in eq. (1.22) and eq. (1.23) is called ΛCDM.
We summarize the key events in the thermal history of the the universe, according
to the ΛCDM, (see also Tab. 1.5)

• Baryogenesis - The universe features an asymmetry between observed matter

and antimatter10, which can be quantiﬁed through the ratio

η =

nb
s0

(cid:39) 8 × 10−10 ,

(1.26)

where nb is the number density of baryonic particles. Since we do not have
experimental access to the energies at which baryogenesis presumably took
place, we do not know which physical process has produced the asymmetry in
eq. (1.26), despite many mechanisms have been proposed.

• Electroweak Phase Transition - Assuming that the universe was reheated
at a temperature above MEW, when the thermal bath reached a temperature
of about 100 GeV, the electroweak phase transition occurred [39, 40, 41, 42],
causing the higgs ﬁeld to get a VEV. As a consequence the electroweak group
SU (2)L × U (1)Y got broken to the electromagnetism one U (1)em and the par-
ticles of the SM became massive.

• QCD Phase Transition - Above 150 MeV quarks were asymptotically free,
and the thermal bath was composed by a phase of matter called Quark Gluon
Plasma. Around the temperature of 150 MeV strong interactions became
relevant and the quarks were suddenly constrained to form hadrons.

10We ignore the possible existence of compact objects made of antimatter, such that there is no
asymmetry as in eq. (1.26). Such compact objects are predicted in some models [35, 36] and do
not contradict observations [37, 38].

16

• DM Freeze-Out - Assuming that DM is of the cold type and that it is

composed of WIMPs, it decoupled at a temperature around 1 MeV.

• Neutrino decoupling - Since neutrinos interacted with the thermal bath
only through weak interactions, the same estimate as for WIMP DM holds,
with a minor correction, so that the freeze-out took place at a temperature
around 0.8 MeV.

• Electron-Positron annihilation - Electrons and positrons annihilated soon
after neutrino decoupling at a temperature of 0.5 MeV, slightly reheating the
photon thermal bath. As a consequence the energy density of neutrinos ρν is
related to that of photons ργ as

(cid:18) 4

(cid:19)4/3

ρν =

8

Neﬀ

11

ργ ,

(1.27)

where Neﬀ is the eﬀective number of neutrinos, and this expression is valid after
neutrino decoupling. The eﬀective number of neutrinos after e+e− annihilation
in the SM is Neﬀ,SM = 3.046.

• Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) - At a temperature of about 300 KeV,
light elements started to be formed. This is the furthest epoch of which we have
proper and detailed comprehension [43, 44], both from a phenomenological and
from a theoretical point of view.

• Recombination - At a temperature of about 0.3 KeV the neutral hydrogen
formed via the reaction e− +p+ → H +γ, since its reverse reaction had become
disfavored.

• Photon Decoupling - Before recombination the photons were coupled to
the rest of the plasma essentially through Thomson scattering e− +γ → e− +γ.
The sharp drop in the free electron density after recombination made Thomson
scattering ineﬃcient and the photons decoupled at 0.25 eV. As a consequence,
they started their free-stream through the universe, and are today observed as
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).

The CMB consists of free-streaming photons which last-scattered about 400000
years after the “birth” of the universe. They have an excellent black-body spectrum
with temperature [45]

T0 = 2.725 ± 0.001 K .

(1.28)

17

This spectrum is almost perfectly uniform in all directions, so that we can infer that
the universe at photon decoupling was almost perfectly isotropic and homogeneous.

1.2 Beyond the Standard Paradigm

1.2.1 Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics

We start by listing all the problems featured by the Standard Model of particle
physics:

1. Observational issues. The Standard Model does not describe

• gravity,
• dark energy,
• dark matter,

18

• neutrino masses.

2. Theoretical issues.

• Electroweak Hierarchy Problem - This problem is two-fold: the ﬁrst issue
is to understand the physical origin of the hierarchy between the scales
MEW and MP, while the second issue is to understand how it is possible
to keep this hierarchy stable against quantum corrections.
In fact, as
we mentioned in the introduction to the chapter, in general scalar ﬁelds
are not protected by any symmetry, and then they can receive arbitrarily
large quantum corrections to their mass. This is the case for the higgs
ﬁeld, which receives quadratic corrections of the form

δm2

Higgs (cid:39) yt

8π2 Λ2

cutoﬀ ,

(1.29)

where Λcutoﬀ is the energy scale at which physics beyond the SM appears,
ranging from MEW to MP, while yt ∼ 1 is the Yukawa coupling of the
largest correction due to the top quark. If Λcutoﬀ (cid:39) MP the ﬁne-tuning
required in order to keep the higgs mass light is of the same order of the
ratio MEW/MP ∼ 10−16.

• Strong CP Problem - As we mentioned in Sec. 1.1.1, a term as in eq.
(1.11) can be added to the SM lagrangian, and the angle θ is severely
constrained by the experimental bounds on the electric dipole moment of
the neutron: θ < 10−10. The lack of a dynamical mechanism to this huge
ﬁne-tuning of θ is known as Strong CP Problem.

• Gauge Coupling Uniﬁcation - The running of the Renormalization Group
(RG) makes gauge coupling constants evolve in such a way that they
tend to meet at a high scale. However, in the Standard Model the gauge
coupling uniﬁcation is not suﬃciently precise to imply that it is not simply
an accident.

• Arbitrariness - There are many arbitrary parameters in the lagrangian
of the SM, whose values have to be inserted by hand, in order for the
predictions to match with experimental data. These parameters include
the number of families of the SM, the masses of fermions (excluding
neutrinos) which span a range of ﬁve order of magnitude (from me (cid:39) 0.5
MeV to mt (cid:39) 170 GeV.) and are intimately related to Yukawa couplings,
CKM angles, neutrino masses and mixing angles. All these parameters
deserve a deeper explanation in terms of dynamical mechanisms which

19

ﬁx their values to the physical ones. Analogously, also the higgs scalar
potential is assumed to have the form given in eq.
(1.5) for no good
reason, in order to produce the electroweak symmetry breaking.

Supersymmetry

Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a space-time symmetry which mixes bosonic and fermionic
degrees of freedom of a theory. In its ten-dimensional version, supersymmetry is an
essential ingredient of string theory, as we observe in Sec. 1.3. Moreover, two-
dimensional worldsheet supersymmetry is crucial in order for string theory to admit
space-time fermions.

Four-dimensional global supersymmetry has been the main candidate for physics
beyond the Standard Model for decades, mainly due to its ability to address the hi-
erarchy problem [50, 51]. The simplest supersymmetric extension of the Standard
Model of particle physics is the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM),
whose chiral spectrum is summarized in Tab. 1.6. Essentially it provides a doubling
of the degrees of freedom of the SM: to each SM particle corresponds a superpartner
with diﬀerent spin and equal mass. An exception is represented by the higgs sector,
where anomalies cancellation requires an additional higgs doublet along with the
superpartners. All the ﬁelds in Tab. 1.6 can be accommodated in N = 1 chiral
supermultiplets.
In addition to the ﬁelds in Tab. 1.6 there are also vector mul-
tiplets composed of the gauge bosons B, W 0, W ±, gi and the respective gauginos

(cid:101)B,(cid:102)W 0,(cid:102)W ±,(cid:101)gi, where i = 1, . . . , 8 since gluons gi and gluinos (cid:101)gi transform in the
adjoint representation 8 of SU (3)col. The fermionic ﬁelds (cid:101)B and(cid:102)W are called bino

and wino respectively.

The Yukawa couplings between matter fermions and the higgs ﬁeld are given by

the minimal phenomenologically viable superpotential

WMSSM = uiY ij

U QjHu − d

D QjHd + eiY ij

L LjHd + µHuHd ,

(1.30)

so that the masses of leptons and quarks are determined as usual by the higgs mech-
anism. Eq. (1.30) contains also an explicit mass term for the higgs, which is called
µ-term and determines the mass of higgsinos. The µ-term is required in order to
get a phenomenologically satisfactory EW symmetry breaking. The superpotential
in eq. (1.30) is not the most generic renormalizable and gauge invariant one: terms
violating B and L have been excluded in order to avoid rapid proton decay. All

the excluded terms violate an additional symmetry of the MSSM, called R-parity,
under which SM particles are even and their superpartners are odd. R-parity can
be interpreted as a discrete Z2 subgroup of the symmetry U (1)B−L, which is spon-
taneously broken to Z2 by the VEV of a scalar with charge 2 under B − L. R-parity
has important consequences from a phenomenological point of view, since it implies
that the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) is stable and consequently it could
be a viable candidate for DM.

Supersymmetry must be spontaneously broken in nature, since a selectron with
mass m˜e (cid:39) 0.5 MeV has not been observed. Regardless of the explicit mechanism
of SUSY-breaking, its eﬀects can be parametrized in terms of the soft-terms, i.e.
additional mass terms and cubic interactions [52]

Model (mSUGRA).

There are many theoretical motivations to look at supersymmetry as a good

candidate for the physics beyond the SM.

• It potentially solves the hierarchy problem, since the divergent diagrams are
exactly canceled by the analogous diagrams involving the superpartners, in
the case of unbroken supersymmetry. When supersymmetry is spontaneously
broken by soft-terms, the quadratic divergences are still eliminated, but there
are non-vanishing logarithmic divergences. The hierarchy problem is addressed
provided that the mass of squarks is not far beyond 1 TeV.

• If R-parity is present, the LSP constitutes a good candidate for DM.
• Provided that the masses of gauginos and higgsinos lie around the TeV scale,
the MSSM provides a uniﬁcation of the coupling constants at the GUT scale
MGUT = 2× 1016 GeV. Scalars do not contribute to gauge coupling uniﬁcation
since they enter the equations of the renormalization group for gauge couplings
only at two-loops order.

11From the ﬁrst condition in eq. (1.33) it is possible to infer the so-called µ-problem: µ is a
supersymmetric quantity but in order to get a satisfactory SUSY-breaking it has to be of the same
order of mHu, mHd, which are non-supersymmetric quantities.

The conditions in eq. (1.33) are not trivially satisﬁed by the scalar potential in eq.
(1.32). However EWSB can be triggered by radiative corrections to m2
Hu, which
receives negative contributions from one-loop diagrams involving the top squark.
Consequently also the higgs mechanism ﬁnds a dynamical explanation in the MSSM.

The EWSB can produce a mixing among the gauge eigenstates of the MSSM,

whose superpartner mass spectrum is given by the

only squarks of the third generation actually mix, due to the large Yukawa

with gauge eigenstates for all scalars except the stop, whose left and right

components ((cid:101)tL,(cid:101)tR) mix and give rise to the physical stops ((cid:101)t1,(cid:101)t2).

Z, W ±. The remaining ﬁve degrees of freedom are: two CP-even neutral scalars
h0, H 0, one CP-odd neutral scalar A0, two charged scalars H±. h0 turns out
to be the lightest one, and then it plays the role of the SM higgs ﬁeld. The

Supergravity

Supersymmetry, as described in the previous section, is a global symmetry. Interest-
ingly, as soon as we promote the parameters of a supersymmetry transformation to
a space-time-dependent function, general coordinate transformations are included in
the theory, which becomes a theory of gravity [12, 13, 53], and it is called (N = 1)
supergravity. From a ﬁeld theoretical point of view, the inclusion of gravity can be
described by an additional multiplet, which is called gravity multiplet. It contains
the mediator of the gravitational interactions: a spin-two massless particle called
graviton gµν and its superpartner, a spin-3/2 massless particle called gravitino ψµ
α
(where α = 1, 2 is a spinorial index). The gravitino plays the role of the gauge ﬁeld
of local supersymmetry.

A supergravity theory can be completely determined starting from the following

three functions of the chiral superﬁelds Φi:

i
1. The K¨ahler potential K(Φi, Φ

):
kinetic terms of the chiral ﬁelds.

it is a real function which determines the

2. The holomorphic superpotential W (Φi): along with the K¨ahler potential it

determines the scalar potential of the supergravity theory.

3. The gauge kinetic functions fa(Φi): they are holomorphic functions of the
chiral superﬁelds Φi, which determine the kinetic terms of the gauge bosons
and their couplings to axions.

As for global supersymmetry, also the local one has to be spontaneously broken.
Local supersymmetry breaking produces the analogous of the higgs mechanism: a
scalar ﬁeld in the hidden sector acquires a VEV which breaks the local supersym-
metry. The fermionic superpartner (goldstino) of this scalar ﬁeld is swallowed by
the massless gravitino, which acquires mass. This local SUSY-breaking is called
Super-Higgs mechanism. From a phenomenological point of view it is interesting
to notice that local SUSY-breaking automatically generates soft-terms in the global
supersymmetric lagrangian, realizing the so-called gravity mediated SUSY-breaking.
Usually, the scale of SUSY-breaking is roughly given by the gravitino mass.

24

Unfortunately, even if local supersymmetry automatically includes gravity, it is
neither a ﬁnite theory nor a renormalizable one, meaning that it does not provide
an UV completion of General Relativity.

GUT Theories

As we have seen in Sec. 1.2.1, in supersymmetric models gauge coupling uniﬁcation
is achieved at the scale MGUT. Another kind of models which provide gauge cou-
pling uniﬁcation are Grand Uniﬁed Theories (GUT theories)12 [54]. They assume
that the SM gauge group is actually contained in a larger simple group GGUT which
is spontaneously broken to GSM around the GUT scale by a higgs-like mechanism.
In this picture, at energies above MGUT gauge couplings are uniﬁed into a single
value: the gauge coupling associated to the GUT group. In the last decades diﬀer-
ent alternatives have been studied in the context of GUT theories, the most relevant
ones being those with gauge groups SU (5), SO(10) or E(6).

For example in the SU (5) GUT, each SM fermionic generation ﬁts into a re-
ducible SU (5) representation 5 + 10.
It provides the existence of 24 bosons, of
which 12 are the SM ones, while the remaining 12 transform as SU (2)L doublets
and SU (3)col triplets. The higgs sector is composed by a 24 scalar ﬁelds transform-
ing in the representation 24 of SU (5). The VEVs acquired by some of these ﬁelds
trigger the symmetry breaking which leads to the SM gauge group. An interesting
point about GUT theories is that, since quarks and leptons ﬁt into the same GUT
multiplets, they can transform into each other by emission/absorption of a heavy
gauge boson, giving rise to lepton/baryon number violation. These interactions are
clearly suppressed by the mass of the heavy bosons, leading to a proton lifetime of
about τproton,SU (5) (cid:39) 4 × 1029 yrs, which is quite below the super-Kamiokande lower
bound τproton (cid:39) 1032 − 1033, so that the simplest SU (5) GUT is ruled out.

GUT theories with diﬀerent gauge groups have similar features, with increas-
ingly more involved higgs sectors and symmetry breaking patterns. For example
the breaking of SO(10) to GSM requires a “GUT-Higgs” transforming in the adjoint
representation 45 of SO(10), plus additional scalar ﬁelds transforming in the rep-
resentation 16. Analogously, the lowest-dimensional non-trivial representation of
E(6) is the 27, which contains the representation 16 of SO(10), since it decomposes

12From which the subscript in the uniﬁcation scale MGUT.

25

as

27 = 16 + 10 + 1 .

(1.38)

Symmetry breaking in E(6) models is triggered by the VEVs of the “GUT-Higgs”
ﬁeld in the adjoint representation of E(6) and of the scalar ﬁelds in the 27. A
possible symmetry breaking pattern is given by

E(6) −→ SU (3)col × SU (3)L × SU (3)R −→ GSM ,

(1.39)

where the intermediate gauge group, in which the QCD symmetry is treated on
equal footing with left-right symmetries, is called triniﬁcation model.

The most interesting GUT models are the supersymmetric versions, since they
provide a much better agreement with the experimental values for the Weinberg
angle and the proton lifetime.

Further Alternatives

We mention a couple of alternatives to supersymmetric theories:

1. Brane-world and large extra-dimensions - The possibility that there exist more
dimensions than those that we naively observe is a very old idea. In the ’20s in
fact, T. Kaluza and O. Klein attempted to unify gravity with electromagnetism
by postulating the existence of a circular ﬁfth dimension [55, 56], whose radius
is small enough to escape the detection. The idea of extra-dimensions turns
out to be completely natural in string theory, where there are six curled up
extra-dimensions, which are usually assumed to be very small. There is a
further alternative, according to which extra-dimensions are large enough to
be in the detection range of the LHC, called Brane-World Scenario. In this
scenario the SM particles are conﬁned in a four-dimensional subspace of a
higher-dimensional space-time. Such a subspace is called brane. On the other
hand, gravitons can move freely in the full higher dimensional space-time, so
that in this picture the weakness of the gravitational interaction with respect
to the other forces can be explained by its dilution [57]. For example, assuming
that there exist n extra-dimensions compactiﬁed to circles with radii R, then
the Planck scale can be written as

M 2

P = 8πM 2(2πR)n ,

(1.40)

26

where M is the (n + 4)-dimensional Planck scale. The hierarchy problem can
be addressed by assuming a large R, so that the value of M is lowered to 1
TeV. Unfortunately the large value of R has not a dynamical explanation in
this scenario.

2. Strong dynamics - A possible alternative solution to the hierarchy problem
is by assuming that the higgs ﬁeld is not an elementary particle, but a bound
state resulting from some yet-unknown strong dynamics [21]. In this picture
the hierarchy between MEW and MP can be explained in the same way as
the hierarchy in eq. (1.1) between the proton mass mp and the Planck scale
MP. Models of physics beyond the SM built following the idea that some
strong dynamics is hiding behind the higgs boson usually go under the name
of Technicolor Models. Despite their attractiveness, these models do not seem
to feature phenomenological viable patterns for fermion masses and mixings.

1.2.2 Beyond the Standard Model of Cosmology

Despite its undeniable success, the Standard Model of cosmology contains many
problems:

1. Initial singularity - Tracing back the scale factor a(t) using the Einstein’s
equation, in the Standard Model of cosmology it inevitably ends up in a sin-
gularity: all the energy of the universe is supposed to be concentrated in a
single point at t = 0. This is a clear signal of the breakdown of General Rela-
tivity in the very early universe, when the energy was concentrated in such a
small region that both quantum mechanics and gravity had important eﬀects.
This problem can only be cured within a quantum theory of gravity.

2. Horizon problem - The high uniformity of the CMB temperature is unex-
plained within the Hot Big Bang Theory: tracing back the evolution of the
universe just using General Relativity and the Standard Model, it is possible
to check that at photon decoupling there were many patches that could have
never been in causal contact.

3. CMB anisotropies - As we discussed in Sec. 1.1.2 the uniformity of the CMB
is astonishing: anisotropies in its temperature have a tiny size with respect to
∼ 10−5. However, such deviations from
the background temperature T0:
uniformity can not be produced within the Standard Model of cosmology.

δT
T0

4. Flatness problem - As we mentioned in Sec. 1.1.2, the universe today appears
to be extremely ﬂat, with |Ωcurv| < 0.005. However, even a tiny curvature in

27

the very early universe would have increased to large values at present time,
(tPlanck) ∼ 10−61 is required in order
so that a huge ﬁne-tuning of order ρcurv
ρc
satisfy the current bounds.

5. Monopole problem - According to GUT theories, topological defects such
as monopoles have been created in the early universe. Since they are stable
objects, they should be still present to date in such a quantity that they would
dominate the energy density of the universe. However, experimental searches
for topological defect have failed, setting stringent bounds on their energy
density in the universe.

Finally we should emphasize that the thermal cosmological history depicted in
Sec. 1.1.2 is completely understood and experimentally tested only from the Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis on. In particular

• If there is a uniﬁcation mechanism as in GUT theories, additional phase tran-
sitions may have occurred in the universe, provided that it was reheated to a
suﬃciently high temperature.

• There are several mechanisms proposed for baryogenesis, but none of them
has found an experimental validation. It is commonly accepted that baryo-
genesis happened at some stage after inﬂation, since otherwise the baryon
asymmetry would have been smoothed out by the exponential expansion of
the universe. In order to get baryon asymmetry the Sakharov conditions have
to be met [58]: i) baryon number violation, ii) C and CP violation, iii) ther-
mal non-equilibrium (or CPT violation). Among the several mechanisms for
baryogenesis we mention the electroweak mechanism [59, 60, 61], which makes
use of the non-perturbative baryon and lepton number violation in the SM,
the GUT mechanism, which exploits the baryon and lepton number violation
intrinsic in GUT theories, and the Aﬄeck-Dine mechanism [62], which uti-
lizes the dynamics of MSSM ﬂat directions to develop a baryon asymmetry.
Interestingly, in [63] the authors realized a string theory embedding of the
Aﬄeck-Dine mechanism. All the proposed mechanisms (including the elec-
troweak one) make use of physics beyond the Standard Model.

• It is commonly accepted that the decoupling of neutrinos at a temperature
of about 1 MeV gave rise to a neutrino background similar to the CMB13,
but with a smaller temperature of about Tν,0 (cid:39) 1.95 K. Unfortunately, it is

13Assuming that the universe was reheated at a temperature larger than 1 MeV.

28

very hard to observe the cosmic neutrino background, due to the weakness of
neutrino interactions.

Inﬂation

Problems 2., 3., 4., 5.
in the previous list can all be cured at once by assuming
that the universe underwent a period of exponential expansion at very early stages,
when the age of the universe was about tinf ∼ 10−34 sec [64, 65, 66]. Such period is
called inﬂation. Inﬂation explains the uniformity of CMB temperature since, in this
picture, regions of the universe which apparently have never talked to each other,
were in causal contact in the very early stages before the accelerated expansion.
Inﬂation provides also a fascinating explanation to the origin of the anisotropies
observed in the CMB [67, 68]: according to the inﬂationary paradigm quantum ﬂuc-
tuations taking place in the universe during inﬂation have been stretched out by
the accelerated expansion, resulting in the tiny anisotropies observed in the CMB
temperature [49, 69].
Interestingly, also the presence of large scale structures in
the universe can be explained as the result of the evolution of quantum ﬂuctua-
tions in the early universe under the action of inﬂation: a perfectly homogeneous
and isotropic universe would not give rise to galaxies and stars. Finally, inﬂation
addresses also the ﬂatness and monopole problems, since the accelerated expansion
would drive the universe towards ﬂatness, diluting any possible unwanted relics like
topological defects.

The simplest model of inﬂation requires the presence of a scalar ﬁeld φ, called

inﬂaton, minimally coupled to gravity, so that the action reads

the Hubble parameter is almost constant, and the space-time is approximately de
Sitter:

H 2 ≈ V
3

a(t) ∼ eHt ,

(1.45)

which corresponds to an exponential expansion.

As already mentioned, at the classical level inﬂation would produce a completely
uniform universe, which is not what we observe. The formation of large scale struc-
tures and of the anisotropies of the CMB are consequences of the quantum ﬂuctua-
tions of the inﬂaton δφ and of the metric δgµν around the homogeneous background
during inﬂation (labeled with a bar)

φ(x, t) = φ(t) + δφ(x, t) ,

gµν(x, t) = gµν + δgµν(x, t) .

(1.46)

For practical purposes, after having eliminated redundant degrees of freedom, it
turns out that there are three relevant perturbations: one scalar perturbation R
and two tensor perturbations h = h+, h×14. Two important statistical measures of
the primordial ﬂuctuations are the power spectra of R and h, which can be deﬁned

We shall emphasize that inﬂation is still an hypothesis, whose predictions have
been repeatedly confronted and found to be in agreement with cosmological ob-
servations. Among these we would like to recall the impressive agreement between
the predicted angular power spectrum of CMB temperature ﬂuctuations and the ob-
served one. The most striking correspondence between observations and inﬂationary
predictions is probably the fact that all the Fourier modes of perturbations gener-
ated during inﬂation have the same phase [72, 73]. Such observation is suﬃcient to
rule out many competing alternatives to inﬂation.

31

1.3 String Theory

All the alternatives for the physics beyond the Standard Model described so far have
been inspired by the principle of naturalness and by the search for the uniﬁcation
of forces, but they do not provide a new conceptual framework in which gravity can
be conciliated with quantum mechanics. To date, the most promising candidate
as a theory of quantum gravity is string theory. In a ﬁrst approach string theory
can be deﬁned as a theory in which the elementary objects are not point-like as in
particle physics, but rather they are one-dimensional objects with typical length (cid:96)s,
sweeping out a two-dimensional surface, called the worldsheet Σ. Since strings have
not been observed in particle accelerators, it is necessary to assume that (cid:96)s is smaller
than the scales currently explored in experiments. Diﬀerent patterns of vibration of
the strings eﬀectively produce the crowd of particles of the SM or extensions thereof.

Interestingly, the quantization of string theory produces the unavoidable presence
of a spin-two particle in the massless spectrum [74], which behaves like a graviton:
gravity is naturally included in string theory at the quantum level. The reason why
string theory works nicely as a theory of quantum gravity is intuitive: the typical
length (cid:96)s acts as an intrinsic cut-oﬀ for the theory, eliminating the divergences
encountered in the straightforward quantization of General Relativity. Furthermore,
although not completely clear at a ﬁrst glance, string theory potentially contains
also all the building blocks necessary to reproduce the SM in the low-energy limit,
such as non-abelian gauge interactions, chiral fermions in three families, and so
on. For this reason string theory is supposed to be a framework in which all the
interactions can be ﬁnally uniﬁed into a single description. A further nice feature
of string theory is that it does not contain any unknown external parameter except
the string length (cid:96)s, so that all the SM parameters (like the number of generations,
the Yukawa couplings, etc.) have to be determined by the dynamics of the theory
itself. On the cosmological side, inﬂation can be naturally accommodated in the
low-energy limit of string theory, since it contains many fundamental scalar ﬁelds
which can play the role of the inﬂaton. More in detail, all the alternative scenarios
for physics beyond the Standard Models of particle physics and cosmology described
in Sec. 1.2 can be potentially embedded in string theory as low-energy eﬀective ﬁeld
theories. However, a honest statement about the state of the art is that a completely
consistent model which reproduces all the experimentally established observations
has not been found to date, although we much progress has been made in the last
years.

32

1.3.1 Basic Facts About Strings

Strings naturally come in two types: open strings, with two free end-points, and
closed strings, with no end-points. They respectively sweep out worldsheets with
and without boundaries. The two-dimensional worldsheet Σ swept out by strings
can be locally parametrized by the coordinates (τ, σ). Σ embeds in a generically D-
dimensional space-time through a set of functions X M (τ, σ), where M = 0, . . . , D−1.
The dynamics of strings is described by the Polyakov action [14, 16]

(cid:90)

Σ

SP = − 1
4πα(cid:48)

d2x(cid:112)− det g gab(τ, σ)∂aX M ∂bX N ηM N ,

a = 1, 2 ,

(1.53)

where gab is a metric on Σ and ηM N is the Minkovski metric on the D-dimensional
α(cid:48). The Polyakov action in eq. (1.53) features several
space-time, while (cid:96)s = 2π
symmetries:

√

• global D-dimensional space-time Poincaré invariance,
• invariance under two-dimensional local worldsheet coordinate re-parametriza-

tion,

• invariance under local rescaling of the two-dimensional metric (Weyl invari-

ance).

Fixing the invariance under the local coordinate re-parametrization (light-cone gau-
ge), it is possible to see that only oscillations orthogonal to the worldsheet are phys-
ical, so that the dynamics described by the Polyakov action reduces to that of D− 2
two-dimensional free massless scalar ﬁelds. Solving the equations of motion for this
system gives rise to a tower of inﬁnite decoupled harmonic oscillators, which corre-
spond to the oscillations of the string. Finally, the quantization of the system leads
to the spectrum of space-time ﬁelds in string theory.

In the perturbative regime, space-time string interactions can be treated in a way
similar to that used in particle physics. Scattering amplitudes between asymptotic
states can be computed as a quantum path integral, summing over all the possible
topologies of the worldsheet which interpolate between the asymptotic states:

(cid:104)out| evolution|in(cid:105) =

[DX]e−SP[X]OinOout ,

(1.54)

where the vertex operators Oin/out encode the information about in and out asymp-
totic states. Similarly to what happens in particle physics, each “Feynman diagram”

worldsheets

33

(cid:88)

(cid:90)

can be built by combining a set of basic string interactions vertices, each of which
is weighted with a suitable power of the string coupling gs (cid:28) 1. Since string theory
does not contain external unknown arbitrary parameters except (cid:96)s, gs has to be dy-
namically determined by the theory itself. Indeed, it is given by the VEV of a scalar
ﬁeld which is always present in the massless string spectrum, namely the dilaton φ:

gs = e(cid:104)φ(cid:105) .

(1.55)

The perturbative expansion for closed strings is obtained by adding handles to the
worldsheet, while the expansion for open strings is obtained by adding boundaries.
Each “Feynman diagram” is weighted in the perturbative expansion by g−χ
, where
χ is the genus of χ of Σ, namely

s

χ = 2 − 2g − nb ,

(1.56)

for a worldsheet with g handles and nb boundaries. Given the structure of the basic
interaction vertices, closed strings are always present in an interacting theory, while
the presence of open strings is not mandatory.

Weyl invariance plays a central role in the dynamics of string theory. In fact,
the requirement that this symmetry is not an anomalous one in the quantum theory
determines the dimension of the space-time D. As soon as a non-trivial background
is considered (as an example a metric diﬀerent from Minkovski for the D-dimensional
space-time), the theory described by the Polyakov action becomes an interacting
one and it is not exactly solvable. However, it can be studied perturbatively around
the free theory, and the parameter governing the perturbative expansion is α(cid:48)/R2,
where R denotes the typical length-scale of variation of the space-time ﬁelds15. As
a consequence, string theory in a general background features a double expansion:
the genus-expansion controlled by gs and the α(cid:48)-expansion governed by α(cid:48)/R2.

Spectrum

In order to get fermions in the spectrum of string theory, it is necessary to consider
a generalization of the Polyakov action, such that the two-dimensional theory is
supersymmetric. Consequently new fermionic degrees of freedom ψM are included
as the superpartners of the bosonic ﬁelds X M. In this picture, the requirement of
Weyl anomaly cancellation ﬁxes the dimension of the space-time to ten. Depending

15Eventually R boils down to be the typical size of the compact space made up of the extra-

dimensions.

34

on the way of quantizing it, string theory leads to ﬁve diﬀerent possibilities for the
spectrum, whose massless components are summarized in Tab.s 1.7 and 1.8. Typi-
cally, the spectrum is given by a tower of string states, whose spacing is determined
by the unique external unknown parameter of the theory

(1.57)

where Ms = 1/(cid:96)s is the string scale. Since we are interested in the physics taking
place at distances larger than the string length, we have to consider the eﬀective
ﬁeld theory of massless string states, corresponding to energies E (cid:28) Ms. The
acronyms NS and R in Tab.s 1.7 and 1.8 refer to diﬀerent possibilities for the choice
of fermionic boundary conditions:

1. Neveu-Schwarz (NS): ψi

L/R(τ + σ),

2. Ramond (R): ψi

L/R(τ + σ + (cid:96)s) = −ψi
L/R(τ + σ),

L/R(τ + σ + (cid:96)s) = ψi

where ψi
L/R denote respectively the the left-movers and right-movers fermionic de-
grees of freedom. Boundary conditions can be chosen independently for left- and
right-movers, and the two sectors have to be glued together in a way that preserves
the modular invariance of the partition function (this step is called GSO projection).
Modular invariance is a crucial property of string theory, since it is the underlying
mathematical structure which allows it to behave properly as a quantum theory of
gravity. More in detail:

• Type II string theory - There are two Type II string theories: Type IIA and
Type IIB. Both of them contain only closed strings, and they diﬀer in the way
of performing the GSO projection. Left and right sectors are treated on equal
footing in Type II string theories: both sectors contain bosonic and fermionic
degrees of freedom. The massless spectrum is divided into four sectors: NSNS,
NSR, RNS and RR. The NSNS is common to Type IIA and Type IIB and
contains the ten-dimensional metric gM N, the dilaton φ and the two-form ﬁeld
BM N. The RR sector contains form-ﬁelds, whose degrees are diﬀerent in Type
IIA and Type IIB. Both theories contain two gravitinos and dilatinos, which
have opposite chiralities in Type IIA and the same chiralities in Type IIB. In
the former case the massless spectrum features a ten-dimensional N = (1, 1)
supersymmetry, while in the latter case the massless spectrum features a ten-
dimensional N = (2, 0) supersymmetry. Massless spectra coincide with those
of the ten-dimensional Type IIA and Type IIB supergravity theories.

in this case left and right sectors are not treated on equal footing: the left sector
contains only bosonic degrees of freedom, while the right one contains both
bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. Due to the GSO projection, it turns
out that there are two consistent ways to get a modular invariant partition

1.3.2 String Phenomenology

In spite of the fact that string theory is supposed to be a fundamental theory of
nature providing a framework in which all the interactions are uniﬁed, during the
last forty years its study has led to many developments in several areas of physics,
and its application goes well beyond that expected from a theory of quantum grav-
ity. The birth of AdS/CFT in 1997 for instance [75, 76] has made string theory

a useful tool to explore corners of physics which apparently are completely dis-
connected from quantum gravity. For example the AdS/CFT correspondence has
applications in condensed matter physics [77] and in the physics of strong inter-
actions at high temperatures and densities [78]. Furthermore, the study of string
theory has led to important developments also in mathematics, the most important
of which is the discovery of mirror symmetry [79, 80]. Remarkably, using string
theory, Strominger and Vafa were able to exactly reproduce the known result for
the Bekenstein-Hawking black-hole entropy [81], giving support to the idea that it
is the correct microscopic description of gravity. Consequently, string theory can be
fairly described using prof. M. Greene’s words: to date string theory is not simply
a “theory of string-like elementary particles”, but rather a

magniﬁcent theoretical framework that interrelates a very wide range of topics in

physics and mathematics16.

Nevertheless, string theory is primarily supposed to be a fundamental theory of
nature, which is able to unify all the interactions at the quantum level. In order to
study the truthfulness of this claim, it is necessary to connect the ten-dimensional
picture to the four-dimensional one, which is the goal of the branch of string theory
usually referred to as string phenomenology [18]. This is done by assuming that
six out of the ten dimensions are curled up to form a compact space, whose typi-
cal size is smaller than the distances currently explored in the particle accelerators,
so that extra-dimensions escaped the detection so far. As it is intuitive, the four-
dimensional physics depends on the details of the geometry and of the topology

of the compact space, but unfortunately there are an inﬁnite number of possible
choices for it. Given that a selection principle for the compact space is missing so
far, it is very diﬃcult to get predictions from string theory. Phenomenological re-
quirements like four-dimensional supersymmetry can help to restrict the choice to a
certain class of compact spaces, called Calabi-Yau manifolds [83, 84], but still there
is a huge number of spaces of this kind. Connecting string theory to the real world
then seems a quite diﬃcult task.

Historically, Heterotic theories have been the ﬁrst ones to be studied with the in-
tention of connecting the ten-dimensional picture to the real world [85, 86, 87]. This
is because they contain non-abelian gauge symmetries in their massless spectrum,
and upon compactiﬁcation they can give rise to a four-dimensional chiral theory.
On the other hand Type II theories did not appear that promising at ﬁrst, since
they neither feature a non-abelian sector in their massless spectrum, nor they give
rise to chiral theories in four dimensions. Nevertheless, the search for the right com-
pactiﬁcation space is quite hard in Heterotic theories, since SM ﬁelds arise directly
from the closed massless string spectrum, whose ﬁelds inhabit the whole compact
space and depend on its details [88, 89, 90, 91, 92]. This way of dealing with string
phenomenology is usually called top-down approach.

With the advent of D-branes in 1995 [93], it was realized that four-dimensional
chiral theories can also be obtained in Type II string theories. Indeed, SM ﬁelds
can arise from the open string sector which is supported by D-branes [94]. D-branes
also constitute a source for RR ﬂuxes, so that they allow the ﬁeld strengths for the
form-ﬁelds to acquire non-vanishing VEVs. Furthermore, with the introduction of
D-branes, there is also a major advantage from a technical point of view: since they
can be located in small regions of the compact space, interesting physical quantities
of the SM arising from them should be independent of the details of the whole com-
pact space. It is then possible to locally build a D-branes conﬁguration which gives
rise to a visible sector with the desired phenomenological properties, and eventually
embed it into a global compact space in a consistent way [95, 96, 97, 98, 99]. This is
the approach to string phenomenology used in the present thesis, and it is usually
referred to as bottom-up approach.

Given the diﬃculty of choosing a precise compact space, the best approach to
string phenomenology is to look for physical eﬀects which are shared by large classes
of compactiﬁcations. For instance, regardless of the speciﬁc choice of the compact

38

space, all string compactiﬁcations come with a large number of gravitationally cou-
pled scalar ﬁelds, called moduli, which are singlets under the SM gauge group. Such
ﬁelds are the four-dimensional manifestation of the existence of extra-dimensions.
Depending on their masses moduli can play a signiﬁcant role in the cosmological
evolution of the universe, and can give rise to observable eﬀects. It is important to
remark that the observation of any of these eﬀects would not prove the correctness
of string theory. This in fact can only be established either by the direct observation
of strings or by the observation of a physical eﬀect which can arise exclusively by
string theory. Nevertheless, the (non-)observation of physical eﬀects due to moduli
can help us to understand whether a given class of models is representative of the
physical reality or not, and to drive us towards the right way in the never-ending
search for a fundamental theory of nature. On the theoretical side, string theory
provides the unique available framework in which one can explicitly test if a given
model describing some aspects of nature can be consistently embedded in a quantum
theory of gravity.

Eﬀective Action for Type II Closed Superstrings

As we discussed in the previous section, in the present thesis we use the bottom-up
approach to string phenomenology, hence we are interested in Type II string theo-
ries. In this section we review some basic facts about their low-energy limit, showing
explicitly the eﬀective actions for the closed massless ﬁelds in Tab. 1.7.

In the string frame the bosonic eﬀective action for massless states of Type II

string theories takes the form

(also called ﬂuxes) of the RR forms, deﬁned as

Fp = ˆFp − H3 ∧ Cp−3 ,

where ˆFp = dCp−1. In Type IIB F5 is constrained to be self-dual:

F5 = ∗10F5 .

It is useful to introduce an alternative convention for the RR ﬁelds, called the

where p = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 in Type IIA, and p = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 in Type IIB. In order to
halve the propagating degrees of freedom, it is necessary to impose a self-duality
constraint:

Fp = (−1)Int( p

2 ) ∗10 F10−p ,

(1.67)

which automatically includes the constraint on F5 in eq. (1.63).

Gauge transformations of form-ﬁelds, which leave the ﬂuxes invariant, can be

are reported in Sec. 2.1.2.

Flux Compactiﬁcations and Model
Building

As we have pointed out in Sec. 1.3.1, in the present thesis we use the bottom-up ap-
proach to string phenomenology. We consider Type II String Theories, in which SM
gauge interactions take place on D-branes localized in a small region of the compact
space [18, 99]. Roughly, in these constructions it is possible to separate global issues
(i.e. moduli stabilization) from local ones (i.e. the search for a D-branes conﬁgura-
tion reproducing the MSSM or proper extensions thereof) as we will describe more
accurately in Sec. 2.2.2.

We have already observed in Sec. 1.3.1 that the quantization of string theory

gives rise naturally to the string scale, deﬁned as

Ms =

1
(cid:96)s

,

(2.1)

which is the only external unknown parameter of string theory and determines the
spacing of the tower of string states. In order to connect string theory with the real
world, we are interested in the physics taking place at energies below the string scale
(or equivalently, at distances larger than the string length (cid:96)s)

E (cid:28) Ms ,

(2.2)

so that only massless modes of the string spectrum are excited. As pointed out in
Sec. 1.3.1, massless ﬁelds of Type II string spectra correspond to Type II Super-
gravity spectra, so that eq. (2.2) is called supergravity approximation. Supergravity
spectra and the corresponding eﬀective actions of Sec. 1.3.2 are the starting point

41

for the compactiﬁcation procedure.

Given the nice features of N = 1 four-dimensional supersymmetry that we re-
viewed in Sec. 1.2.1, we look for a class of compactiﬁcations which preserve N = 1
in four dimensions.
In the ﬁrst part of the present chapter, Sec. 2.1, we brieﬂy
review the properties that such a compact space has to satisfy, starting from the
most generic possibility and showing how phenomenological arguments along with
our poor computational skills restrict the choice of the internal space to a very spe-
ciﬁc kind of manifolds. We conclude the section by reporting the eﬀective action
for the four-dimensional eﬀective theory which arises from the compactiﬁcation. In
the second part of the chapter, Sec. 2.2, we recall basic notions about D3-branes
at singularities, which represent the D-branes setup used in the present thesis to
embed the visible sector into string compactiﬁcations. We conclude the section with
an explicit example of a consistent string compactiﬁcation.

2.1 Flux Compactiﬁcations

The ﬁrst phenomenological requirement that we ask for is the maximal symmetry
of the four-dimensional space, which allows us to write the most general expression
for the ten-dimensional metric in the form

ds2 = e2A(y)˜gµνdxµdxν + gmndxmdxn ,

(2.3)

where e2A(y) is the warp-factor, which depends only on the internal coordinates col-
lectively denoted by y. ˜gµν is a maximally symmetric four-dimensional metric and
gmn is a six-dimensional metric on the internal space. Maximal symmetry of the
four-dimensional space restricts the choice of ˜gµν to a Minkovski, dS4 or AdS4 met-
ric. Greek indexes µ, ν refer to four-dimensional coordinates, while italic indexes
m, n refer to internal coordinates.

In order not to break the maximal symmetry of the four-dimensional space, the
VEVs of all the fermionic ﬁelds have to vanish. Furthermore, in order to have
unbroken supersymmetry in four dimensions, it is also required that the VEVs of
the supersymmetric variations of the fermionic ﬁelds vanish.
In Type II theories
there are two gravitinos ψA
M (A = 1, 2) and two dilatinos λA (A = 1, 2), where
uppercase italic indexes M, N refer to ten-dimensional coordinates. Given these
phenomenological requirements, two possibilities can be explored. In Sec. 2.1.1 we
review the simplest one of them, leaving the analysis of the most generic possibility

42

to the subsequent sections.

2.1.1 Calabi-Yau Compactiﬁcations

In the simplest case, only the metric has a non-trivial background along the internal
space χ [85]. Demanding vanishing VEVs for the supersymmetric variations of the
gravitinos and the dilatino leads to

(cid:104)δψA

M(cid:105) = ∇M A ,

(cid:104)δλA(cid:105) = /∂φ A ,

(2.4)

where the slash denotes a contraction with a ten-dimensional gamma matrix: /∂ =
∂M ΓM 1, while A are the parameters of the supersymmetric transformation.

It is a well known result that Type II string compactiﬁcations with a non-trivial
background only for the metric along the internal manifold lead to an unwarped
Minkovski four-dimensional space, with a Calabi-Yau manifold as internal space
[85]. Indeed, the ﬁrst condition in eq. (2.4) translates into the requirement of the
existence of two covariantly constant spinors on the ten-dimensional space-time

∇M A = 0 ,

whose four-dimensional component reads

k + ∇mA∇mA = 0 .

(2.5)

(2.6)

The solution of eq. (2.6) on a compact space is A = 0, which implies a vanishing four-
dimensional curvature k = 0. On the other hand, in order to study the constraints
arising from the internal components of eq. (2.5), it is necessary to decompose A
as

1
IIA = ξ1
IIA = ξ2

+ ⊗ η+ ⊕ ξ1− ⊗ η− ,

(2.7)

in the Type IIA case, such that Γ1
∗. η is a six-dimensional Weyl spinor, while ξ is a four-dimensional
and η− = (η+)
Weyl spinor. We denote both the chiralities under Γ5 and under γ by the subscripts

so that ΓA

As a consequence the internal component of eq. (2.5) can be written as

∇mη± = 0 ,

(2.8)

(2.9)

which implies that the internal manifold χ has to admit a covariantly constant
spinor η. This constraint can be rephrased into the condition that χ must have
SU (3) holonomy, or equivalently, that it has to be Ricci-ﬂat: Rij = 0. Such mani-
folds are called Calabi-Yau (CY) spaces [85].

CY manifolds3 are both complex and K¨ahler 4, so that we can always choose a
complex basis zi (i = 1, 2, 3) in which the metric has only mixed components. The
K¨ahler form is deﬁned as

J = igijdzi ∧ dzj ,

(2.10)

and it is closed: dJ = 0. Moreover, a CY manifold possesses a unique closed
(3, 0)-form, which we denote by Ω.
In general a CY space can be deﬁned as a
K¨ahler manifold which admits both a closed, globally deﬁned and non-vanishing
(3, 0)-form Ω and a closed, globally deﬁned and non-vanishing (1, 1)-form J. These
can be written also in terms of the covariantly constant spinor η which satisﬁes eq.
(2.9):

Jij = ∓2iη

Ωijk = −2iη

The entire cohomology structure can be summarized in the Hodge diamond for CY

2Γ5 and γ are the chirality matrices respectively in four (space-time) and six (internal) dimen-

sions.

The ﬁrst observation is that on a CY manifold the only undetermined h(i,j) are
h(1,1) and h(1,2). This feature considerably simpliﬁes the compactiﬁcation procedure.
Since there are not harmonic one-forms and harmonic ﬁve-forms, then J ∧ Ω = 0.
Furthermore, since h(3,0) = 1 there is a unique Ω, and then Ω∧ Ω and J ∧ J ∧ J have
to be proportional:

J ∧ J ∧ J =

Ω ∧ Ω .

(2.13)

Unfortunately CY compactiﬁcations feature the presence of many massless scalar
ﬁelds in the low-energy spectrum, which are called moduli and span a manifold called
moduli space. They are related to the possible deformations of the size and of the
shape of the sub-manifolds of the internal space which do not cost any energy, and
manifest themselves in the EFT as ﬂat directions of the scalar potential. In order
to infer the structure of the moduli space it is necessary to look for deformations hij
of the background metric (cid:104)gij(cid:105) which preserve the Ricci-ﬂat condition

R((cid:104)gij(cid:105) + hij) = 0 .

(2.14)

Since we are not interested in deformations which can be re-absorbed through a
general coordinate transformation, it is necessary to ﬁx the gauge, for instance by
imposing ∇ihij = 0. Such deformations can be divided into two categories:

1. Deformations with mixed indexes hij: eq. (2.14) implies that ∆hij = 0, namely
hij is a harmonic (1, 1)-form. The number of linearly independent deformations
with mixed indexes then is counted by the Hodge number h(1,1), and they
correspond to diﬀerent choices of the K¨ahler class. It is possible to expand the

45

deformation

h(1,1)(cid:88)

hij = i

tI(x) (ωI)ij ,

(2.15)

where ωI is a basis of harmonic (1, 1)-forms. The ﬁelds tI(x) are real scalar
ﬁelds, called K¨ahler moduli and they depend only on the four-dimensional
coordinates. In order to ensure that the resulting metric is positive deﬁnite
the following conditions have to be imposed

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

J > 0 ,

γ∈χ

Σ∈χ

J ∧ J > 0 ,

J ∧ J ∧ J > 0 ,

(2.16)

where γ denotes any curve in χ and Σ denotes any surface in χ. The conditions
in eq. (2.16) deﬁne a cone in the linear space spanned by tI, which is called
K¨ahler cone or K¨ahler moduli space.

2. Deformations with non-mixed indexes hij: eq. (2.14) implies that ∆hij = 0,
which means that hij is a harmonic (2, 0)-form. Since CY manifolds feature
h(2,0) = 0, it is useful to relate this kind of deformations to (1, 2)-forms as
follows

h(1,2)(cid:88)

A=1

hij =

(2.17)

where χA is a basis of H (1,2), Ω is the holomorphic (3, 0)-form and ||Ω||2 =
ijk. The four-dimensional ﬁelds U A are called complex structure mod-
1
3!ΩijkΩ
uli, since they parametrize deformations of the complex structure. This can be
understood as follows: as soon as we deform the metric with hij, in order for
the new metric to be K¨ahler , there must be a basis in which it can be written
with mixed indexes components only. Since holomorphic transformations do
not aﬀect the index structure, the only transformation that can remove non-
mixed components is a transformation of the complex structure.

The presence of such massless ﬁelds is strongly disliked from a phenomenological
point of view, for a couple of reasons. The ﬁrst one is that they would mediate long
distance interactions, which are not observed in nature. The second one is that since
all the parameters of the four-dimensional EFT depend on the VEVs of the mod-
uli, without ﬁxing them it would be impossible to get predictions from string theory.

46

Finally, a few words about four-dimensional supersymmetry in Type II CY com-
pactiﬁcations. Starting from a ten dimensional spinor, it is possible to decompose
its 16 representation as

SO(10) −→ SO(6) × SO(1, 3) −→

SU (3) × SO(1, 3)

16

(4, 2) + (4, 2(cid:48))

(3, 2) + (3, 2(cid:48)) + (1, 2) + (1, 2(cid:48)) ,

which implies that the four-dimensional theory preserves a N = 2 supersymmetry,
given that there are two ten-dimensional gravitinos both in Type IIA and in Type
IIB. N = 2 supersymmetry in four dimensions is strongly unwelcome, since it does
not lead to a chiral theory and then it precludes the possibility of getting a realistic
four-dimensional low-energy theory. Consequently, additional ingredients are needed
in the compactiﬁcation, in order to break supersymmetry further to N = 1.

2.1.2 Basic Deﬁnitions About Fluxes

An alternative which has been extensively studied in the last decade is the possibility
to allow for a non-trivial background also for some of the ten-dimensional p-forms
ﬁelds of the massless string spectrum, in addition to the metric. Such compactiﬁca-
tions are called ﬂux compactiﬁcations (see [101, 102, 103] and references therein).
It turns out that ﬂuxes back-react on the geometry of the compact space, so that
Calabi-Yau manifolds are no longer solutions of the supersymmetry conditions, and
it is necessary to re-analyze the constraints coming from requiring vanishing VEVs
for the supersymmetric variations of dilatinos and gravitinos. The solutions to these
requirements, supplemented by the request of breaking half of the supersymmetry
from N = 2 to N = 1 in the four-dimensional EFT, are typically less constrained
manifolds, ranging from complex manifolds to conformal Calabi-Yau’s. We discuss
such solutions in Sec. 2.1.3. In addition, the non-trivial background of the form-
ﬁelds also constrains the shape of the sub-manifolds of the compact space, leading
to the stabilization of some of the moduli and giving them a large mass, as we will
review in Sec. 2.2.1. Flux compactiﬁcations have been extensively studied also in
the context of generalized complex geometry [104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111].
In the present section we review some basic notions about ﬂuxes in string theory.

In order to preserve the four-dimensional maximal symmetry, ﬂuxes can either be
only present along the internal directions of the ten-dimensional space-time, or they
have to ﬁll the four-dimensional space-time (which is only possible for four-forms at

47

least). As a consequence the NSNS ﬂux H3 can only be internal, while F4 and F5
can ﬁll the four-dimensional space for Type IIA and Type IIB respectively. In the
following we assume that these requirements are satisﬁed.

take the form

dH3 = 0 ,

(almost everywhere) ,

(2.18)

where the note “almost everywhere” is to include possible sources.
If these are
present the right hand side of eq. (2.18) is modiﬁed by delta functions with support
on the source world-volume (i.e. D-branes and/or O-planes). In presence of sources
p-form ﬁelds are not well-deﬁned, so that the integral of the corresponding ﬁeld
strength over a cycle can be diﬀerent from zero, i.e. there is a non-vanishing ﬂux.
Non-vanishing ﬂuxes can also arise in the absence of sources, as soon as the cycle
supporting them is a non-contractible one. In general, non-vanishing ﬂuxes have to
obey a Dirac quantization condition, which reads

n = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 for Type IIA, and over n = 3, 5, 7, 9 for Type IIB.

Interestingly, supersymmetry conditions in eq. (2.23) split into two requirements.
The ﬁrst one is a topological requirement, while the second one is a constraint on
the diﬀerential structure of the compact space. Let us analyze them more in detail.

a) Topological condition - The topological condition consists in requiring the ex-

49

istence of a globally well deﬁned non-vanishing spinor. It can be easily un-
derstood in terms of the structure group of the internal manifold [112, 113,
114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119]. The structure group of a manifold is the group
of transformations required to patch the orthonormal frame bundle in such a
way that some structures are preserved on it. For instance, on a Riemannian
six-manifold, the structure that has to be preserved is the metric, and this
requirement automatically reduces the structure group from the general coor-
dinate transformations group GL(6) to SO(6). As soon as new structures are
introduced on the manifold, further restrictions on the structure group take
place. In the case of string compactiﬁcations, as long as we require some pre-
served supersymmetry in four dimensions, or even in the case in which all the
supersymmetries are spontaneously broken by ﬂuxes in the four-dimensional
EFT, supercurrents have to be globally well deﬁned on the compactiﬁcation
space. This means that the internal manifold must admit as many globally
deﬁned spinors as the number of supercurrents is. A globally well deﬁned
non-vanishing spinor exists only if the structure group of the compact space is
reduced to SU (3). This can be easily understood, since the spinor represen-
tation in six dimensions is in the 4 of SO(6) (cid:39) SU (4). Under SU (3) this can
be decomposed as

4 → 3 + 1 ,

(2.24)

so that if the structure group is reduced to SU (3), then the orthonormal
frame patchings admit a singlet, namely a globally well deﬁned non-vanishing
spinor. It is possible to decompose also vectors, two-forms and three-forms
under SU (3), and we get respectively

Vector :
Two-form :
Three-form :

6 → 3 + 3 ,
15 → 8 + 3 + 3 + 1 ,
20 → 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 ,

(2.25)

from which we realize that there are also a globally well deﬁned non-vanishing
real two-form and a globally well deﬁned non-vanishing complex three-form.
They correspond to the K¨ahler two-form J and to the holomorphic three-form
Ω which are present also in the case of CY manifolds, as we pointed out
in Sec. 2.1.1. The topological condition leads to the same results as in the
ﬂuxless case. A manifold whose structure group is reduced to SU (3) is a
SU (3)-structure manifold [120, 121, 122].

50

b) Diﬀerential condition - The diﬀerential condition consists in imposing eq.
(2.23). As we have reviewed in Sec. 2.1.1, in the ﬂuxless case they boil down to
the requirement of reduced SU (3) holonomy for the internal manifold, which
is equivalent to require the existence of a covariantly constant spinor such that
∇η± = 0 on the compact space. In general on a SU (3)-structure manifold,
it is possible to ﬁnd a connection Γ(cid:48) such that the covariant derivative ∇(cid:48)(Γ(cid:48))
(possibly with a non-vanishing torsion) [123, 124, 125]

– is compatible with the metric: ∇(cid:48)g = 0,
– has reduced SU (3) holonomy: ∇(cid:48)η± = 0,

where η is the six-dimensional spinor in eq.s (2.7) and (2.8). In other words
a CY space is a particular example of a SU (3)-structure manifold, in which
the globally well deﬁned spinor is also covariantly constant with respect to the
Levi-Civita connection.

The torsion tensor associated with the new connection Γ(cid:48) can be decomposed as

p ∈ Λ1 ⊗(cid:0)su(3) ⊕ su(3)⊥(cid:1) ,

Tmn

(2.26)

where Λ1 is the space of one-forms and we used the decomposition so(6) = su(3) ⊕
su(3)⊥. Since its relevant action is on the SU (3)-invariant component of η±, the
su(3) piece can be ignored. The corresponding decomposition is called intrinsic

p ∈ Λ1 ⊗ su(3)⊥ = (3 ⊕ ¯3) ⊗ (1 ⊕ 3 ⊕ ¯3)

W4,W5

W3

(2.27)

W1, . . . ,W5 are the ﬁve torsion classes appearing in the covariant derivative of
the globally well deﬁned spinor, which characterize the diﬀerential properties of the
SU (3)-structure manifold [119, 123, 124, 125, 126]. As inferable from eq. (2.27), W1
is a complex scalar, W2 is a complex two-form, W3 is a real primitive (1, 2) + (2, 1)-
form, while W4 and W5 are real vectors. Depending on which component of the
intrinsic torsion is non-zero, the internal space deviates from being a CY manifold.
This can be clearly seen by writing down the exterior derivatives of the K¨ahler two-

(2.28)

(2.29)

In the ﬂuxless case we know that the internal space is a CY manifold and that both
J and Ω are closed forms, so that all the torsion classes vanish. A SU (3)-structure
manifold ranges from being a CY manifold when W1 = ··· = W5 = 0 to being
simply a complex manifold when only W1 = W2 = 0. In Tab. 2.2 we report more
details.

N = 1 Supersymmetry
The main message from the previous section is that the presence of ﬂuxes back-
reacts on the geometry of the compact space, making some components of the torsion
diﬀerent from zero, so that the manifold is no longer a CY space. Furthermore, non-
vanishing ﬂuxes can break supersymmetry. In order to study the four-dimensional
N = 1 Minkovski vacua which are compatible with ﬂux compactiﬁcations, it is
necessary to impose a relation between the four-dimensional spinor ξA (A = 1, 2)
in eq.s (2.7) and (2.8). The only possible choice which allows to preserve the four-
dimensional maximal symmetry is to take the four-dimensional spinors proportional
to each other [101]

a(y)ξ1

+ = b(y)ξ2

+ = ξ+ ,

(2.30)

52

where the proportionality complex functions a and b depend on the internal coordi-
nates y. Then it is possible to decompose the ten-dimensional spinors as

and

IIA = ξ+ ⊗(cid:0)bη−(cid:1) ⊕ ξ− ⊗ (bη+) ,

IIA = ξ+ ⊗ (aη+) ⊕ ξ− ⊗ (aη−) ,

IIB = ξ+ ⊗ (aη+) ⊕ ξ− ⊗ (aη−) ,

2

(2.31)

(2.32)

Using eq.s (2.31) and (2.32) to impose the supersymmetry conditions in eq. (2.23)
provides a set of relations between the torsion, the ﬂuxes, the cosmological constant
and the warp-factor, which describe how the four-dimensional N = 1 supersymmet-
ric vacuum sits in the underlying N = 2 EFT. One degree of freedom of the complex
functions a and b can be ﬁxed by the normalization: |a|2 + |b|2 = eA, where e2A is
the warp-factor. A second degree of freedom is redundant and can be ﬁxed by a
gauge choice [101, 107], then all N = 1 ﬂux vacua are parametrized by a couple of
angles α and β as follows

a = eA/2 cos α ei β
2 ,

b = eA/2 sin α e−i β
2 .

(2.33)

In Tab.s 2.3 and 2.4 we report the results for Type IIA and Type IIB respectively.
We can discuss them separately:

• Type IIA - In Type IIA, as can be observed in Tab. 2.3, there are two classes

of solutions to the supersymmetry conditions in eq. (2.23):

(A) It corresponds to a solution with the NSNS ﬂux and the singlet com-
It features W1 = W2 = 0, but W3 (cid:54)= 0 and
ponents of RR ﬂuxes.
W 5 = 2W4 = ∂φ, meaning that the compact space is complex but it is
not even K¨ahler or symplectic.

(BC) It is a solution with only RR ﬂuxes, and W1 = W3 = W4 = 0, such
that the compact space is symplectic. It corresponds to the dimensional
reduction of an M-theory solution on a seven-dimensional manifold with
G2 holonomy [120]. In case of a eleven-dimensional torsion-free G2 struc-
ture the internal space becomes a K¨ahler manifold, corresponding to the
second column of Tab. 2.3 with F (8)

2 = 0.

We can conclude that the introduction of ﬂuxes in Type IIA causes a sub-
stantial back-reaction on the geometry of the compact space, which deviates
signiﬁcantly from being a CY manifold.

• Type IIB - In Type IIB there are three5 diﬀerent classes of solutions to the

supersymmetry conditions in eq. (2.23), as shown in Tab. 2.4:

(A) This class of solutions is very similar to class (A) of Type IIA. In par-
ticular the vanishing torsion classes are again W1 = W2 = 0, so that the
internal manifold is complex. In Type IIB all components of RR ﬂuxes
are zero.

(B) This class of solutions is the most interesting one. One of its main prop-
erties is that it allows for the RR ﬁve-form and for both RR and NSNS
3-forms. The latter are related by a Hodge duality. It is convenient to
deﬁne the three-form ﬂux

G3 = F3 − ie−φH3 = ˆF3 − τ H3 ,

(2.34)
3 = ∓∗ H (6)
5Actually the classes are four. There is an additional class called (ABC). We refer to [125] for

where τ = C0 + ie−φ is the axio-dilaton. The constraint eφF (6)

54

translates into the fact that G3 is Imaginary Self Dual (ISD), namely

∗6G3 = iG3 .

(2.35)

Finally, since in the class (B) there are not non-vanishing ﬂuxes in the
singlet representation, then G(0,3)

3 = 0.

(BNF) This sub-class features W1 = W2 = W3 = 0, and 3W4 = 2W5 = 6∂A,
so that the manifold is a conformal Calabi-Yau space, accordingly to
Tab. 2.2. Non-vanishing torsion classes source a slight deviation from
a CY space, since the metric can be written as

ds2 = e2Aηµνdxµdxν + e−2A˜gmndxmdxn ,

(2.36)

where ˜gmn is a CY metric. The conformal factor e−2A is the inverse
of the warp-factor and as we will discuss below, in the limit of large
volume it can be safely neglected. As a consequence, all the mathe-
matical tools developed for CY compactiﬁcations can be used in this
case to compute the four-dimensional eﬀective ﬁeld theory.

(BF) In this case W4 = W5, so the internal manifold is not a conformal
CY, even if it is still complex. Furthermore it features a non-constant
holomorphic dilaton τ. This class gives rise to F-theory solutions.

(C) This class is S-dual to class (A), hence it has only RR ﬂuxes and the same

vanishing torsion classes: W1 = W2 = 0.

We can conclude that as soon as ﬂuxes are introduced into the compactiﬁcation,
they back-react on the geometry so that typically the internal manifold is far from
being a CY space. As we argued, the most interesting class of solutions is the Type
IIB (BNF) class, to which we refer for simplicity as warped compactiﬁcations [96,
127, 128, 129, 130, 131], since it leads to warped (or conformal) CY manifolds. In
this case, the conformal factor is the inverse of the warp-factor, and in the large
radius limit it can be written as

(2.37)

e2A ∼ 1 + O

R4

where N measures the units of three-form ﬂux G3, while R is the radius of the com-
pact space (assuming it is isotropic). Hence, in the large radius limit, corrections
to the CY metric can be safely neglected, and the KK reduction can be performed
using the mathematical tools we illustrated in Sec. 2.1.1. In particular the mod-

uli space can be approximated with that of a CY manifold. Even if this is a very
good approximation in the large volume regime, a proper computation of the moduli
space should include the warping [132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140]. In the
present thesis we focus on warped compactiﬁcations, and we perform computations
in the large volume regime, in order to trust the supergravity approximation, so
that we can also safely neglect warping eﬀects on the moduli space of the conformal
CY manifold.

Any additional object introduced in the compactiﬁcation can further back-react
on the geometry, possibly destroying the warped compactiﬁcation solution. For
instance, let us recall what supersymmetries are preserved by sources for ﬂuxes,
such as D-branes and O-planes [15].
In general D-branes and O-planes preserve
supersymmetries whose transformation parameters are related in the following way

1 = Γ⊥2 ,

(2.38)

where Γ⊥ denotes the product of ten-dimensional gamma matrices in the directions
orthogonal to the source itself. It turns out that in general the product of six or two
gamma matrices in euclidean space has eigenvalue ±i, so that D3/D7-branes and
O3/O7-branes preserve supersymmetries of the type a = ±ib. Such supersymmetries
correspond exactly to those preserved in warped compactiﬁcations, as reported in
Tab. 2.4 (the minus sign is the right one for anti D3-branes). On the other hand

56

the products of 4 gamma matrices have eigenvalue ±1, so that D5/D9-branes and
O5/O9-planes preserve supersymmetries of the class Type IIB (C). For this reason,
in this thesis we consider warped compactiﬁcations with D3/D7-branes and O3/O7-
branes.

2.1.4 Equations of Motion
After having determined the class of internal manifolds which admit N = 1 super-
symmetry, we have to check that in such backgrounds the equations of motion of
string theory can be satisﬁed. We have already observed that in the ﬂuxless case,
the integrated equations of motion in eq. (2.6) let us rule out warped CY com-
pactiﬁcations. In this section we review some generic constraints arising from the
integrated equations of motion in presence of ﬂuxes. As we will observe, the ﬁrst
consequence is the necessity to introduce sources for ﬂuxes in the compactiﬁcation.

The relevant constraints for the ten-dimensional bosonic massless ﬁelds of Type

IIB strings are:

• Einstein’s equation,
• Equation of motion for the dilaton,
• Bianchi identities for ﬂuxes,
• Equations of motion for ﬂuxes,

As a ﬁrst step, let us focus on the constraints coming from RR ﬁelds. Due to
the self-duality constraint in eq. (1.67) it turns out that the equations of motion for
the RR ﬁelds, which take the form

d (∗10Fp) + H3 ∧ ∗10Fp+2 = 0 ,

are contained into the Bianchi identities

dFp − H3 ∧ Fp−2 = 0 .

(2.39)

(2.40)

Every time we have to impose diﬀerential conditions such as in eq.
(2.40) on a
compact manifold we face with constraints coming from their integrated version, as
a consequence of the Gauss’ law. The simplest example in quantum ﬁeld theory
arises in presence of a scalar ﬁeld φ with a source J on a compact space χ. The
equation of motion is of the form 2φ = −J, hence it constrains the integral of the

57

source to vanish(cid:82)

χ J = 0. The same happens when we consider the constraints in eq.
(2.40). As reported in Tab. 2.4, due to supersymmetry F3 ∼ ∗6H3, and then from
eq. (2.40) we can immediately infer that the compactiﬁcation is inconsistent, since
the integral of dF5 on the compact space χ vanishes, while the integral of H3 ∧ F3
is positive deﬁnite. This kind of inconsistency can be avoided in string theory due
to the presence of BPS sources, like O3-planes, which contribute to the right hand
side of eq. (2.40) with the right sign. Including the contributions coming both from
D3-branes and from O3-planes, which are sources for the D3-brane density charge,
the Bianchi identity reads

eq. (2.44) we are neglecting possible contributions to the D3-charge density arising
from D7-branes. We will provide more details on tadpole cancellation in a compact-
iﬁcation in Sec. 2.2.3.

It is also possible to get a constraint on the geometry of the compact space
from the integrated equations of motion in a way which does not make use of the
supersymmetry conditions of Sec. 2.1.3, but with the only assumption of warped
metric as in eq.

(2.45)

where α is a generic function which depends only on the internal coordinates, col-
lectively denoted by y. Subtracting from eq. (2.45) the trace of the non-compact
components of the Einstein’s equation we get (in the Einstein frame)7

Condition 3. holds for BPS objects like D3-branes and O3-planes. Also D7-branes
satisfy this condition, since as we have previously observed, they preserve the same
N = 1 supersymmetry of D3-branes. Condition 1. implies that the ﬁve-form F5 is
constrained to be of the same form as in warped compactiﬁcations of Tab. 2.4, while
condition 2. ensures that the three-form G3 has to be ISD, again as in warped com-
pactiﬁcations. We infer that the constraints from the equations of motion in case
of a warped metric as in eq. (2.36) lead almost to the same background geometry
that we got from supersymmetry conditions, assuming that all the localized sources
present in the compactiﬁcation are BPS objects. The slight diﬀerence is that super-
symmetry constraints allow neither for a non-vanishing singlet component G(0,3)
of
the three-form ﬂux nor for a non-vanishing non-primitive (1, 2) component of G3,
while equations of motion do. The non-primitive (1, 2) component of G3 is always

absent on a CY manifold, because there are not non-trivial ﬁve-forms. On the other
hand the G(0,3)
component can be used to break supersymmetry in a controllable
way, as we explain below.

Finally, let us come back to the Einstein’s equation and to the equation of motion

for the dilaton. In the Einstein frame they read

is exactly the same as in warped compactiﬁcations of Tab. 2.4. G(0,3)
to break supersymmetry from N = 1 to N = 0. However, from eq. (2.48) we im-
mediately realize that, as soon as we introduce D7-branes into the compactiﬁcation,
the internal space is no longer a warped CY, since it is not Ricci-ﬂat ˜Rij (cid:54)= 0. In
order for the constraints arising from the integrated equations of motion to be satis-
ﬁed, the dilaton ﬁeld has to acquire a dependence on the internal coordinates. This
means that we are bound to consider F-theory solutions, lying in the class (BF ) of
supersymmetric solutions of Tab. 2.4. In the following we will work in a halfway
case, since we will compute the spectrum of the EFT assuming that the internal
space is a conformal CY, but at the same time we will introduce a limited number
of D7-branes (which are usually needed for the consistency of the compactiﬁcation,
as we will see for example in Sec. 2.2.3), so that we can consider the right hand sides
of eq.s (2.48) as small perturbations of the conformal CY background. At the same
time, in order to get SUSY-breaking in a controllable way, also the G(0,3)
component
of the three-form ﬂux has to be a small perturbation of the warped compactiﬁcation.

2.1.5 Moduli Space and Kaluza-Klein Reduction

In order to get the four-dimensional spectrum of the compactiﬁcation, it is neces-
sary to perform a Kaluza-Klein (KK) reduction of the ten-dimensional theory on a
compact internal manifold χ. This procedure typically gives rise to a tower of states,
called Kaluza-Klein (KK) states whose masses scale as8 mn ∼ nMs/R, where R is
the radius of the compact space. R can be rewritten in terms of the volume V of the

8In this rough estimate we assume that the compactiﬁcation manifold is isotropic.

60

compact space as R = (cid:96)sV 1/6. As we have have observed in Sec. 1.3 Ms ∼ MPV−1/2,
so that the KK states masses are given by

Mn ∼ nMPV 2/3 .

(2.49)

Since massive KK states have not been observed in nature, we are interested in the
EFT which is valid below the scale at which the massive KK states are excited

E (cid:28) MKK (cid:39) MPV 2/3 ,

(2.50)

namely we consider only massless KK ﬁelds, which correspond to harmonic forms of
the compact internal space [141]. Eq. (2.50) is called KK approximation. In order
to trust the supergravity approximation we require V (cid:29) 1, then there is a hierarchy
between the string scale and the KK scale

MKK (cid:28) Ms (cid:28) MP .

(2.51)

The computation of the four-dimensional spectrum requires the knowledge of the
moduli space of the compact manifold, and this is exactly the reason why it is nec-
essary to restrict to the class of warped compactiﬁcations in Tab. 2.4. In the other
cases the moduli space is poorly known. As we stressed in the last section, even in
the conformal CY case the moduli space is not exactly the same as in CY manifolds,
but assuming that the warping eﬀects are small corrections we can safely use the
mathematical tools of Sec. 2.1.1 to compute the spectrum.

The ﬁrst step is to expand the ten-dimensional form-ﬁelds in the basis provided

in Tab. 2.1, and we get [142]

B2(x, y) = B2(x) + bI(x)ωI , C0(x, y) = C0(x) , C2(x, y) = C2(x) + cI(x)ωI ,

C4(x, y) = DI

2(x) ∧ ωI + V ˆA(x) ∧ α ˆA − Y ˆA(x) ∧ β ˆA + ψI(x)˜ωI ,

(2.52)

where the ﬁelds on the left hand sides of the equations represent the ten-dimensional
ﬁelds, which depend both on the four-dimensional coordinates x and on the internal
coordinates y. On the other hand, the coeﬃcients of the expansions which depend
only on the four-dimensional coordinates x, are four-dimensional ﬁelds. Along with
the ﬁelds tI(x) and U A(x) in the expansions of eq.s (2.15) and (2.17), the ﬁelds
2(x), V ˆA(x), Y ˆA(x), ψI(x) and the graviton
B2(x), bI(x), C0(x), C2(x), cI(x), DI

61

gµν(x) constitute the four-dimensional spectrum of the KK reduction9. They can be
organized in N = 2 supermultiplets as follows

• 1 gravity multiplet: (gµν, V 0),
• h(2,1) vector multiplets: (V A, U A),
• h(1,1) hypermultiplets: (tI, bI, cI, ψI),
• 1 double-tensor multiplet: (B2, C2, φ, C0).

The four-dimensional action can be obtained simply by inserting the expansion of the
ten-dimensional ﬁeld in the ten-dimensional supergravity action and then integrating
over the internal compact space. The result is

9Due to the self-duality of the ﬁve-form F5 it is necessary to eliminate half of the degrees of
2(x) and Y ˆA(x). We further discuss

freedom in the expansion of C4(x, y). We choose to eliminate DI
this point in Sec. 2.1.6.

As expected, the bare compactiﬁcation of the ten-dimensional supergravity on a CY
space gives us a N = 2 supersymmetric theory in four dimensions.
In the next
section we will review how to reduce it to N = 1 theory.

2.1.6 N = 1 EFT from Type IIB Orientifolds
In Sec. 2.1.3 we have observed that a broad set of ﬂux conﬁgurations is compatible
with a N = 1 four-dimensional supersymmetric EFT, and as we already stressed,
we restricted to the class warped compactiﬁcations in Tab. 2.4 because in the limit
of large volume for the compact space, it is known how to safely perform the KK

63

reduction. Furthermore, in Sec. 2.1.4 we have noticed that, in order to satisfy the
constraints coming from the integrated equations of motion, the compactiﬁcation
must include negative tension sources for the D3-brane charge density, namely O3-
planes. Very interestingly, these two observations nicely ﬁt together. In fact, as we
mentioned at the end of Sec. 2.1.3 the introduction of O3/O7-planes is compatible
with warped compactiﬁcations, so that on the one hand they leave us with a N = 1
low-energy theory, and on the other hand it is possible to keep trusting the EFT.
From a practical point of view, the N = 1 spectrum is obtained by truncating the
N = 2 spectrum of the previous section, projecting out the state which are not
invariant under an involution introduced by the presence of the O-planes. In the
present section we brieﬂy review this procedure following [143].

As a ﬁrst step we require that χ is symmetric under an action σ such that:

1. it leaves invariant the four-dimensional non-compact space-time,

2. it is involutive σ2 = 1,

3. it is isometric: σg = g,

4. it is holomorphic: σJm
5. it acts on the holomorphic three-form as σ∗Ω = −Ω,

n = Jm

n,

n = Jmpgpn is the complex structure, and σ∗ is the pull-back of σ. σ can
where Jm
be interpreted as a reﬂection with respect to a ﬁxed plane, which is the O-plane.
Since it leaves the four-dimensional space-time invariant, O-planes have to span
the non-compact directions. Let us notice that the requirement of holomorphicity
in principle allows all even-dimensional O-planes, but in order to lie in the class
of warped compactiﬁcations, we additionally require condition 5., which leaves out
O5/O9-planes. In fact, in complex coordinates zk, we can write Ω ∝ dz1 ∧ dz2 ∧ dz3.
Because of condition 5., we have two possibilities: either one single complex coor-
dinates gets reversed under σ, or all the complex internal coordinates get reversed
under σ. The ﬁrst possibility implies that the O-plane spans 8 dimensions (namely
it is a O7-plane), while the second possibility means that the O-plane spans 4 di-
mension (namely it is a O3-plane). Hence σ is compatible with supersymmetry in
presence of O3/O7 planes.

The spectrum of the N = 2 theory can be consistently truncated by the action

64

of the operator

OO3/O7 = (−1)FL Ωpσ ,

(2.62)

where Ωp is the usual world-sheet parity, while FL is the space-time fermion number
in the left moving sector. We summarize the parity of the Type IIB ten-dimensional
bosonic ﬁelds under the action of Ωp and (−1)FL in Tab. 2.5.

into two eigenspaces under the action of σ∗, corresponding to the eigenvalues ±1

In Tab. 2.6 we report the dimensions of the cohomology groups, and also the splitting

spectrum.

It is easy now to infer the orientifolded spectrum of the four-dimensional EFT.
• φ(x, y) and C0(x, y) are invariant under OO3/O7 and then the four-dimensional

ﬁelds φ(x) and C0(x) remain in the spectrum.

• Since B2(x, y) are odd under the combined action of (−1)FL Ωp, only the odd
components under the action of σ∗ remain in the spectrum. Their expansions
look like

B2(x, y) = bi(x)ωi ,

C2(x, y) = ci(x)ωi .

(2.65)

• C4(x, y) is even under the combined action of (−1)FL Ωp, then only the even

components under σ∗ remain in the spectrum. Its expansion looks like

C4(x, y) = Di

2(x) ∧ ωi + V α(x) ∧ αα + Yα(x) ∧ βα + ψi(x)˜ωi .

(2.66)

• Since the action of σ∗ is holomorphic, then only the even components under

σ∗ of the K¨ahler form J remain in the spectrum

J = ti(x)ωi .

(2.67)

• Given that the action of σ leaves the metric invariant, while Ω is odd under the
action of σ∗, then only the odd components of the complex structure moduli
remain in the spectrum, and the expansion of the metric perturbation in eq.
(2.17) takes the form

The surviving ﬁelds constitute a N = 1 EFT, and they assemble into the multi-

plets reported in Tab. 2.7

A few observations are in order at this point. First, notice that the four-
dimensional forms B2(x) and C2(x) are projected out of the N = 1 spectrum. Fur-
thermore, the non-vanishing of the scalar ﬁelds cι and bι are related to the presence

of O7-planes. In fact, since O-planes are ﬁxed loci under the orientifold involution,
in presence of only O3-planes all the tangent vectors are odd under the action of σ.
As a consequence the expansions in eq. (2.65) are not admitted. On the contrary,
if also O7-planes are present in the compactiﬁcation, then it is possible to get har-
monic forms with the correct transformation behavior so that the expansions in eq.
(2.65) are admitted, and the scalar ﬁelds cι and bι remain in the spectrum.

The four-dimensional eﬀective action can be computed by performing again a KK
reduction of the orientifolded spectrum. Since it is just a long but straightforward
operation, we mention only a couple of key points:

• Once we take into account the orientifold projection, the metric on the complex

2 and Yα (or equivalently for ψi and V α) coincide
the equations of motion for Di
with the self-duality condition and then it is possible to eliminate Di
2 and Yα
(or ψi and V α) by inserting their equations of motion into the action. The
choice of eliminating the former or the latter corresponds to the choice of
expressing the four-dimensional action in terms of linear or chiral multiplets
respectively. Since we want to express the four-dimensional action in terms of
chiral multiplets, we choose to eliminate Di

2 and Yα.

We report the four-dimensional action expressed in terms of chiral multiplets:

In eq.s (2.76) and (2.77) M I denotes collectively all complex scalars of the the-
ory and KIJ is a K¨ahler metric which satisﬁes KIJ = ∂I∂J K(M, M ), where K is
the K¨ahler potential of the theory. The K¨ahler covariant derivative takes the form
DIW = ∂IW + (∂IK)W .

It is necessary to ﬁnd a complex structure on the moduli space such that the
metric of the action in eq. (2.74) is manifestly K¨ahler . It turns out that the coor-
dinates U a on the space of the complex structure deformations are already proper
K¨ahler coordinates and Gab is the corresponding K¨ahler metric. On the contrary,
the remaining ﬁelds need a non-trivial redeﬁnition [143, 144]:

ψi are axionic ﬁelds. Since they correspond to the integral of C4 over the four-
cycles of the compact manifold, the N = 1 EFT inherits a perturbative shift-
symmetry under the transformations

ψi → ψi + ˜ψi ,

˜ψi = const. ,

(2.80)

from the gauge symmetry in eq. (1.68) of the ten-dimensional theory. Also the ﬁeld
C0 is an axion. It inherits the same shift-symmetry as the ﬁelds ψi as a consequence
of the gauge symmetry of the ten-dimensional C0(x, y) ﬁeld. As a consequence ψi
and C0 do not enter the expression for the tree-level K¨ahler potential K0, which in
terms of the coordinates in eq. (2.78) can be written as

ions of eq. (2.80).

An interesting point is that the moduli space takes the diagonal form

(2.84)

where each component is a K¨ahler manifold.
In [140] the author computed the
K¨ahler potential without neglecting warping eﬀects and he showed that they deform
the K¨ahler component of the moduli space. In the present thesis we do not consider
this possibility. As we will observe in Sec. 2.2.2, the introduction of the visible
sector supported on D3-branes at singularities spoils the product structure of the
moduli space at sub-leading order in the volume expansion. In the simpliﬁed case
with Gι = 0 the tree-level moduli space undergoes a further split, since the ﬁrst
term depends only on the K¨ahler moduli, while the second term depends only on
the axio-dilaton. Such splitting is however broken as soon as quantum corrections
to the tree-level K¨ahler potential in eq. (2.81) are considered.

The tree-level K¨ahler potential K0 in eq.

(2.81) obeys the no-scale structure

condition, which takes the form

where the sum runs over the moduli (Ti, Gκ). Eq. (2.85) implies that the scalar
potential in eq. (2.77) is positive semi-deﬁnite.

where Mαβ is reported in eq. (2.54). It turns out that fαβ are holomorphic in U a,

tree-level superpotential of the form

(2.87)

χ

which is called Gukov-Vafa-Witten (GVW) superpotential [145]. As we will see in
detail in Sec. 2.2, the generation of this superpotential, which can be traced back to
the presence of ﬂuxes, gives mass to some of the moduli of the compactiﬁcation. No-
tice that K¨ahler moduli do not appear in W0, as a consequence of its holomorphicity
and of the shift-symmetry in eq. (2.80) of axion ﬁelds.

2.2 Model Building

The aim of the present section is to show how to build a semi-realistic model of
particle physics starting from the EFT built in Sec. 2.1.6. There are two main issues
in doing model building following the bottom-up approach [99]:

• Global issues: as we already mentioned, moduli are massless scalar ﬁelds which
are unwelcome from a phenomenological point of view, since on the one hand
they would mediate a ﬁfth force which is not observed in nature, and on the
other hand all the parameters of the action in eq. (2.76) depend on their VEVs,
so that without ﬁxing them it is not possible to get predictions from string
theory. The procedure used to ﬁx the moduli is called moduli stabilization and
it is the main subject of Sec. 2.2.1.

• Local issues: as we argued, in the bottom-up approach to string phenomenol-
ogy, the visible sector is localized on stacks of D-branes wrapping some cycles
in the compact space. It is anyway necessary to look for a D-branes conﬁg-
uration which reproduces the desired extension of the SM. This is the main
subject of Sec. 2.2.2.

Given that the visible sector is localized in a small region of the compact space,
a nice feature of these models is that they allow to get some degree of decoupling

71

between global and local issues, depending on the details of the model. However
in the end, in order to embed the local D-branes conﬁguration within a global con-
struction, it is necessary to perform all the consistency checks which are required to
ensure that the compactiﬁcation is well-deﬁned. We will report an explicit example
in Sec. 2.2.3.

2.2.1 Moduli Stabilization

The present section is organized as follows:
in the ﬁrst part we show how to sta-
bilize many moduli by simply using the presence of ﬂuxes in the compactiﬁcation.
K¨ahler moduli remain unﬁxed, and in order to stabilize them it is necessary to intro-
duce quantum corrections to the tree-level scalar potential as we show in the second
part of the section. Finally, we analyze the moduli stabilization procedure which is
extensively used in the present thesis: the Large Volume Scenario.

Tree-level Moduli Stabilization by Fluxes

The ﬁrst step consists in the analysis of the eﬀects of ﬂuxes on the spectrum of the
EFT [96, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151].

As we have seen in Sec. 2.1.6 the presence of ﬂuxes generates a tree-level super-
potential W0 which depends on complex structure moduli U a and on the dilaton S10,
as in eq. (2.87). The dependence on the complex structure moduli is encoded in Ω,
while the dependence on the axio-dilaton ﬁeld is explicit in the deﬁnition of G3. W0
generates a scalar potential for the complex structure moduli and the dilaton. We
analyze the scalar potential in an inverse volume expansion, since in order to trust
the supergravity approximation V (cid:29) 1. The tree-level expression in eq. (2.75) can
be rewritten in a more compact form as

VO(V−2) = eK(cid:0)|DSW0|2 + |DU W0|2(cid:1) ,

(2.88)

where the ﬁrst term in the bracket corresponds to the ﬁrst term in the bracket of
eq. (2.75), while the second term corresponds to the second term in eq. (2.75). The
sum over the K¨ahler moduli does not appear due to the no-scale structure of eq.
(2.85), which makes the K¨ahler moduli-dependent terms in the bracket vanish. The
only K¨ahler moduli dependence lies into the pre-factor eK ∼ V−2, which induces
a run-away in the K¨ahler directions, as it can be easily understood in the simplest
10Henceforth we use a slightly diﬀerent notation for the axio-dilaton ﬁeld: S = −iτ = e−φ − iC0.

72

example of a single K¨ahler modulus T , which implies V = (cid:0)T + T(cid:1)3/2. This pre-

factor also ﬁxes the order of VO(V−2) in the volume expansion. The only allowed
global minimum is then at VO(V−2) = 0, namely at

Ω ∧ G3 = 0 ,

DU aW0 = i

Given that F-terms govern the breaking of supersymmetry, and they are deﬁned as

the minimum in eq. (2.89) is clearly supersymmetric if the additional requirement
is satisﬁed:

DTiW0 = DGκW0 ∝ W0 = 0 ,

The masses of complex structure moduli and of the axio-dilaton ﬁeld are deter-

mined by the ﬂux energy density, which is

Eq. (2.90) implies the existence of a landscape of vacua, since it gives rise to
2h(1,2) +2 real equations, which have hundreds or thousands of solutions for (S, U )11,
once the parameter space given by (mˆa, eˆa, mˆa

RR, eRR ˆa) ∈ Z4 is scanned.

We can conclude that the presence of ﬂuxes allows for the stabilization of complex

to small values, as required in the perturbative approach.

73

structure moduli U a and the axio-dilaton S at supersymmetric global minima, for
which eq.s (2.90), (2.92) hold. This is an intuitive result, since for a given set
RR, eRR ˆa) ∈ Z4 there exist only a limited number of complex
of ﬂuxes (mˆa, eˆa, mˆa
structures and values of the axio-dilaton ﬁeld which constrain G3 to have only (2, 1)
non-vanishing component. On the other hand, it is also intuitive that the presence
of ﬂuxes does not stabilize K¨ahler moduli, since the ISD condition in eq.
(2.35)
is invariant under a rescaling of the internal metric contained into ∗6, and then a
rescaling of the size of the internal cycles is allowed.

Corrections beyond Tree Level

The presence of ﬂuxes allows to stabilize complex structure moduli and the axio-
dilaton, but it leaves the K¨ahler directions ﬂat as a consequence of the no-scale
structure of eq. (2.85). Nevertheless, there exist various corrections which break the
no-scale structure and then produce a non-vanishing potential for the K¨ahler moduli.
In particular, due to the non-renormalization theorem which protects the superpo-
tential from perturbative corrections [152, 153, 154], we can write schematically

W = W0 + Wnp ,

K = K0 + Kp + Knp ,

(2.94)

where the subscript np stands for “non-perturbative”, while the subscript p stands
for “perturbative”. W0 and K0 are the tree-level expressions, respectively given in
eq. (2.87) and eq. (2.81).

As we have mentioned in Sec. 1.3, string theory naturally contains two diﬀerent
dimensionless expansion parameters: the string coupling constant gs and the string-
over-internal-size α(cid:48)
R2 . The ﬁrst one governs the strength of string interactions, while
the second one governs the eﬀects due to the one-dimensional nature of strings. In
the perturbative approach which we are using, both of them have to be small. As
a consequence two diﬀerent perturbative expansions are allowed in the EFT de-
scending from string compactiﬁcations. Non-perturbative corrections instead are
due to either D3-brane instantons or gaugino condensation on stacks of D7-branes.
At the moment they are well understood only from a four-dimensional point of view.

The corrections we are going to introduce break both four-dimensional super-
symmetry and the no-scale structure, in order to generate a non-vanishing scalar
potential for the K¨ahler moduli. From a ten-dimensional perspective this amounts
of the three-form ﬂux.
to allow for non-vanishing components G(3,0)

74

As we will observe in Sec. 2.2.1, such corrections produce a sub-leading eﬀect in
the eﬀective ﬁeld theory, since the scalar potential for K¨ahler moduli is generated at
order O (V−3), while the supersymmetric stabilization due to ﬂuxes takes place at
order O (V−2). Consequently, in the large volume regime V (cid:29) 1 these corrections
can be considered as small perturbations around the supersymmetric background of
warped compactiﬁcations, so that the EFT is still trustable.

α(cid:48)-corrections - The tree-level ten-dimensional action of Type IIB supergravity
in eq. (1.58) receives corrections from higher derivatives operators. Schematically
they can be written as

SIIB = S0,tree + (α(cid:48))3 S0,(3) + ··· + (α(cid:48))n S0,(n) + SCS,tree+

+ Sloc,tree + (α(cid:48))2 Sloc,(2) + ··· + (α(cid:48))n Sloc,(n) ,

the local action give a non-vanishing potential for D7-branes, but not for D3-branes.
In particular it turns out that the (α(cid:48))2 Sloc,(2) correction produces an eﬀective D3-
branes charge for D7-branes [96]. We focus on the leading α(cid:48)-correction (α(cid:48))3 S0,(3).
Supersymmetry and invariance under worldsheet parity constrain S0,(3) to take the

Euler characteristic of the CY manifold χ considered, which can be written in terms
of the Hodge numbers as

χ(χ) = 2(cid:0)h(1,1) − h(1,2)(cid:1) .

(2.101)

In [162] further α(cid:48)-corrections at the same order (α(cid:48))3 have been computed. We
report on them in Sec. 6.3. Furthermore, in [161] the authors showed that the
orientifold planes present in the compactiﬁcation can aﬀect (α(cid:48))3-correction in eq.
(2.99) by shifting the Euler characteristic in eq. (2.100) in the following way

The eﬀective ten-dimensional action of Type IIB
String Loop Corrections -
strings receives additional corrections from string loop eﬀects, both in the bulk part
and in the local one. Such corrections, which are poorly understood, are governed
by the string coupling constant gs. In the bulk part of the ten-dimensional action
they ﬁrst appear at order (α(cid:48))3, so that they can be though about as a further gs-
expansion of each term in the action SIIB in eq. (2.95), starting from (α(cid:48))3 S0,(3).
String loop corrections have been computed for Type IIB orientifolds on tori with
D5/D9 and D3/D7-branes in [163, 164]. Starting from those results, it is possible
to guess the volume and dilaton dependence of string loop corrections in the case

12For the explicit deﬁnition of t8 in terms of the metric see for example Appendix A of [161]

of a generic CY [165, 166, 167, 168]. In general there are two contributions to the
K¨ahler potential:

• The ﬁrst contribution comes from the exchange between D3-branes (or O3-
planes) and D7-branes (or O7-planes) of closed strings which carry KK mo-
mentum. For this reason they are labeled with a index KK:

where CKK
are complicate unknown functions of the complex structure moduli
which can be computed explicitly only with a full stringy calculation. ailtl is
a linear combination of the two-cycles volumes ti.

• The second contribution from string loops comes from the exchange of winding
strings between intersecting stacks of D7-branes (or between intersecting D7-
branes and O7-planes). It takes the form

Non-perturbative eﬀects - As we already mentioned, non-perturbative eﬀects
are well understood only from a four-dimensional point of view.
In case non-
perturbative eﬀects take place, the superpotential can be written as [103, 169, 170,
171, 172, 173]

W = W0 +

Aj(φ, S, U )e−aj Tj ,

(2.105)

j=1

where the sum takes into account all the contributions from both D3-brane instan-
tons and from gaugino condensation on stacks of D7-branes. φ collectively denotes
the (possibly present) open strings degrees of freedom associated with the stack of
D7-branes on which gaugino condensation takes place. In general A(φ, S, U ) is an
unknown function of φ, U, S. More in detail:

a) D3 branes instantons - They can be obtained by wrapping Euclidean D3-
branes on four-cycles of the compact space χ. In this case it turns out that aj =
2π. Such superpotential is generated only if precisely two fermionic zero modes

77

are present on the world volume of the Euclidean D3-branes. In F-theory and
M-theory such condition can be rephrased in terms of the arithmetic genus χ
of the divisor Σ wrapped by the Euclidean M5-branes [174]

χ(Σ) = h(0,0) − h(0,1) + h(0,2) − h(0,3) = 1 .

(2.106)

A similar condition can be stated in Type IIB in some speciﬁc cases.
It is
important to notice that the zero-modes counting can be substantially modiﬁed
in presence of three-form ﬂuxes and orientifolds [169, 172, 175, 176]. For
example in [170] it has been shown that the component G(1,2)
of the three-
form ﬂux can lift some zero modes.

3

b) Gaugino condensation on stacks of D7-branes - We consider a stack of
space-time ﬁlling D7-branes wrapped around a four-cycle D in the internal
space. The relevant physics is given by the open string spectrum on the D7-
branes world volume. There are several possibilities. We mention two of them
[171, 177]:

Λ is the energy scale at which the VEV of Q ˜Q breaks the gauge group

SU (Nc) to SU (Nc−NF ). If Nc ≤ NF no non-perturbative superpotential
is generated.

As a ﬁnal comment, let us remark that it is not possible to generate a non-
perturbative eﬀect on a geometric cycle which also supports a stack of D7-branes
giving rise to the visible sector [178]. This is a consequence of the chirality of the
MSSM (or some extensions thereof) which makes the K¨ahler modulus T associated
to the four-cycle wrapped by D7-branes charged under an anomalous U (1). As a
consequence of gauge invariance of the superpotential, the non-perturbative contri-
bution can only have the following schematic form [179]

However, since the visible ﬁelds are required to have vanishing VEV, such a non-
perturbative contribution to the superpotential can not arise. This argument pushes
towards the possibility of building the visible sector on top of a singularity of the
compact space, where this problem can be avoided, as we will see in Sec. 2.2.3.

Large Volume Scenario

The Large Volume Scenario (LVS) provides a quite generic way to stabilize K¨ahler
moduli by using an interplay of non-perturbative and α(cid:48)-corrections, which break
the no-scale structure of eq. (2.85) [180]. In this picture both the dilaton S and
the complex structure moduli U a are stabilized at tree-level, as already explained in
Sec. 2.2.1. In the present section we take for simplicity h(1,1)− = 0. In the simplest
version of the LVS the volume of the compact space takes the so-called “swiss cheese”
form:

V = αbτ 3/2

b −

αiτ 3/2

i

,

(2.111)

i=2

where τb = Re(Tb) and τi = Re(Ti) govern respectively the size of the so called “big”
four-cycle and “small” four-cycles, such that τb (cid:29) τi. Since the big cycle is much
larger than the small ones, the volume is dominated by its value. αb, αi are constants
determined by the intersection numbers of the compact space. In the following we
will ﬁx αb = αi = 1, unless diﬀerently speciﬁed. Non-perturbative eﬀects due to
E3-instantons or gaugino condensation on stacks of D7-branes take place on the

where we have included the leading α(cid:48)-corrections introduced in Sec. 2.2.1. Notice
that in order to use LVS it is necessary that ξ in eq. (2.100) is negative, namely the
CY manifold needs to have more complex structure moduli than K¨ahler moduli [180]:
+ .
h(1,2)− > h(1,1)

For the sake of simplicity we consider the case in which h(1,1)

+ = 2, and we
denote the K¨ahler modulus associated to the small cycle T2 ≡ Ts. The F-terms
scalar potential at leading order in the volume expansion has the same form as in
eq. (2.88), despite the presence of α(cid:48)-corrections. Such a scalar potential ﬁxes the
dilaton and the complex structure moduli at the supersymmetric minimum in eq.
(2.89) which we now rewrite as

(2.117)

From eq.
(2.116) we infer that the minimum of the LVS scalar potential lies at
exponentially large volume V (cid:29) 1. Furthermore, since V ∼ easτs and τs ∼ ˆξ, we
understand that the existence of a hierarchy is determined by the smallness of the
string coupling constant gs (cid:28) 1 in the perturbative regime. A nice feature of LVS is
that W0 does not require to be ﬁne-tuned in order to get a minimum, as it happens
in the KKLT setup [146], where W0 ∼ e−τ, with τ denoting here the size of the
four cycle which governs the volume of the compact space. Unfortunately the min-
imum in eq.s (2.116) and (2.117) is not de Sitter, so that for the compactiﬁcation
to reproduce the real world some additional ingredients need to be added. Further
ingredients are also required in order to embed the visible sector into the compact-
iﬁcation, since this can not be supported on a four-cycle whose size is stabilized
through non-perturbative eﬀects, as the small cycles in the LVS setup.

Let us brieﬂy summarize the main properties of LVS relevant for soft SUSY-

breaking:

• Hierarchy of scales: LVS leads to a hierarchy of scales for masses and soft-
terms [155]. In terms of the volume V, the string scale is (see Appendix A
of [155] for the derivation of the exact pre-factors)

the Kaluza-Klein scale is

Most of the moduli receive a mass of order m3/2 except for the volume mode
√V. Hence there is a natural hierarchy of scales
whose mass is mV (cid:39) m3/2/
Ms (cid:29) MKK (cid:29) m3/2 (cid:29) mV for the ﬂux superpotential W0 taking generic values
between 1 − 100.

• Bottom-up model building: The D-branes conﬁguration of the visible sector is
localized in a particular corner of the bulk geometry, allowing for a realization
of the bottom-up approach to string model building [99]. The structure of
soft-terms does not depend on the gauge theory realized in the visible sector
but only on the type of D-branes conﬁguration (e.g. branes at singularities,
D7-branes in the geometric regime) as in the modular approach to string model
building. The realization of the visible sector on a cycle diﬀerent from the one
supporting non-perturbative eﬀects allows to achieve compatibility of chirality
and moduli stabilization [178, 181].

• SUSY-breaking: Assuming a D-branes conﬁguration that leads to the MSSM,
In
the eﬀective ﬁeld theory allows to analyze the structure of soft-masses.
particular, the pattern of soft masses depends on the location and type of the
MSSM D-branes construction in the CY orientifold compactiﬁcation. If the
MSSM is located at a divisor geometrically separated from the main sources
of SUSY-breaking in the bulk, e.g. on a shrinking divisor, there can be a
hierarchical suppression of the soft masses below the gravitino mass and the
lightest modulus [182].
If the dominant source of SUSY-breaking is in the
proximity of the visible sector brane conﬁguration (as it happens if the F-term
of the modulus of the cycle wrapped by the SM brane breaks SUSY), the soft
masses are of order the gravitino mass with only mild suppressions [155, 183,
184, 185].

Generically moduli masses tend to be of order the gravitino mass, as we have
seen in eq. (2.93) and (2.120). In view of the Cosmological Moduli Problem (CMP)
which sets a lower bound on moduli masses of order 100 TeV [186, 187, 188], it is
often desirable to have soft masses well below the gravitino/moduli masses although

14We set the VEV of the Kähler potential for complex structure moduli such that eKcs/2 = 1.

82

achieving this requires a special mechanism at play. We will refer to models which
have hierarchically suppressed soft masses (not just by loop factors) as sequestered
models.15 Depending on the location of SM particles and the value of the CY volume,
we distinguish three interesting LVS scenarios for SUSY-breaking:

1. Unsequestered GUT scale string models: Motivated by uniﬁcation, if
one takes the string scale to be close to the GUT scale 1014 − 1016 GeV, where
the range in the volume captures the uncertainty about high-scale threshold
corrections, then the volume is of order V (cid:39) 103−107 for gs (cid:39) 0.1. This implies
a large gravitino mass, m3/2 (cid:39) 1010 − 1014 GeV, i.e. unobservable sparticles,
unless the ﬂux superpotential is tuned to extremely small values (tuning of
up to W0 ∼ 10−10) to get TeV soft-terms.16 So the generic situation without
tuning W0 is that soft-terms are at an intermediate scale, roughly in the range
1010− 1014 GeV. This scenario is safe from the CMP. The string landscape can
in principle address the hierarchy problem.

2. Unsequestered intermediate scale strings: Requiring TeV scale soft-
terms in an unsequestered setting leads to a volume of order V (cid:39) 1014 for
W0 ∼ 10, implying an intermediate string scale, Ms (cid:39) 5 · 1010 GeV. This
scenario addresses the hierarchy problem, although uniﬁcation has to work
diﬀerently from the MSSM (see [190, 191, 192] for concrete string examples
with intermediate scale uniﬁcation). Its spectrum of soft-terms at the elec-
troweak scale has been studied in [193]. It suﬀers from the CMP since the
volume modulus mass is slightly below 1 MeV.

3. Sequestered high scale string models: There can be special situations
in which the soft-terms are hierarchically smaller than the gravitino mass,
referred to as sequestered scenarios [182].
In LVS this happens in conﬁgu-
rations in which the Standard Model degrees of freedom are localized in the
extra-dimensions, such as in models where the visible sector arises from open
strings on D3-branes at a singularity. In particular, in this setup the F-term
of the Standard Model cycle vanishes and the dominant F-terms are associ-
ated with other moduli (the volume modulus, the dilaton and other Kähler
and complex structure moduli). However the dominant F-terms couple very
weakly to the visible sector because of their bulk separation, and this pro-
duces a hierarchy between the soft-terms and the gravitino mass. Typically

15A similar suppression appears also in the context of realizations of the KKLT scenario [189].
16TeV scale soft masses in this scenario would lead to light moduli which suﬀer from the CMP

since mV (cid:39) 10 GeV.

83

gaugino masses are of order M1/2 (cid:39) m3/2/V, whereas scalar masses can be
as suppressed as the gaugino masses or hierarchically larger by a power V 1/2
(leading to a Split-SUSY scenario in this last case). This makes these models
very attractive for phenomenology since they feature TeV scale soft-terms and
no CMP for V (cid:39) 107 and W0 (cid:39) 50 which give M1/2 (cid:39) 1 TeV, m3/2 (cid:39) 1010
GeV and mV (cid:39) 5 · 106 GeV. The uniﬁcation scale in these models is set by
√
πgsMP/V 1/3 [194, 195] which turns out to be
the winding scale MW = 2π
of the same order of the standard GUT scale. The appearance of this hier-
archical suppression of soft masses is subject to the structure of the eﬀective
supergravity. Changes to the EFT at loop or non-perturbative level (see for
instance [183, 184, 196, 197, 198]) can lead to desequestering. In Sec. 3.3 we
comment more explicitly on possible sources for desequestering while in the
rest of the chapter we assume that these desequestering eﬀects are absent.

In this thesis we focus our attention on sequestered models, hence we need to

introduce D3-branes at singularities.

2.2.2 Visible Sector

As we already discussed, the visible sector in Type IIB can be obtained through a
D-branes conﬁguration [199]. In order to get a sequestered scenario as described
in the last section, we focus on space-time ﬁlling D3-branes conﬁgurations. The
spectrum of a D3-brane is summarized in Tab. 2.8. The ﬁelds in Tab. 2.8 compose

a U (1) multiplet of N = 4 four-dimensional supersymmetry. As a consequence,
the worldvolume theory of a D3-brane is not chiral, and the same happens for the
straightforward generalization to a stack of N D3-branes, whose spectrum can be
arranged in U (N )17 multiplets of N = 4 supersymmetry. The only known way to al-
low for chirality in the case of space-time ﬁlling D3-branes, is by placing the stack on

also the gauge groups SO(N ) and Sp(N ) could be obtained.

84

top of a singularity inside the compact space [99, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204]. D3-branes
at singularities constitute the quintessential realization of the bottom-up approach,
since the visible degrees of freedom arise from a single point in the compact space.
In this case the largest possible separation between gauge degrees of freedom and
bulk ones takes place, allowing to tackle moduli stabilization and D-branes model
building almost independently. The separation is more accentuated if D7 ﬂavour
branes are absent in the compactiﬁcation, since they would couple directly visible
ﬁelds to the bulk. For this reason we avoid the presence of D7 ﬂavour branes, and
we assume that the MSSM comes from a D3-branes construction.

As an example of the power of the bottom-up approach we report a very simple
argument to deduce the volume scaling of the K¨ahler matter metric of visible scalar
ﬁelds [179]. As it is well known, physical Yukawa couplings ˆYαβγ take the form

Yαβγ(cid:113)

ˆYαβγ = eK/2

,

˜Kγ

(2.121)

˜Kα

˜Kβ

in terms of the holomorphic Yukawa couplings Yαβγ and of the K¨ahler matter metric
(assuming it is ﬂavour diagonal) ˜Kα. Since physical Yukawa couplings should be
generated by gauge interactions taking place on top of the D3-branes which corre-
spond to a single point in the compact space, then it is reasonable to assume that
they do not depend on the volume of the compactiﬁcation space. This translates
into the following volume scaling for the K¨ahler matter metric

˜Kα ≈ 1

V 2/3 .

(2.122)

As we will observe in the next section, this is exactly the leading order scaling ob-
tained by performing the Kaluza-Klein reduction.

As we consider a speciﬁc kind of singularities, called del Pezzo singularities,
from a geometrical point of view the most intuitive description of D3-branes at
singularities can be given in terms of the del Pezzo divisor hosting them, in the
non-singular (or “blow-up”) limit [205]. A del Pezzo surface dPn (0 ≤ n ≤ 8) is a
four-cycle inside the CY manifold which contains several non-trivial two-cycles Hi.
In general, for a dPn surface, the non-vanishing Hodge numbers are given by

h(0,0)
dP = 1 ,

h(1,1)
dP = n + 1 ,

h(2,2)
dP = 1 ,

(2.123)

85

so that the Euler characteristic of a dPn is χ(dPn) = n + 3. In the non-singular
limit dPn divisors can be wrapped by D7-branes, Hi can be wrapped by D5-branes,
while 0-cycles inside dPn can support D3-branes. In general, not every D-branes
conﬁguration is a stable one: only BPS states are minimum-energy states and then
they are stable. A stack of D3-branes forms a stable conﬁguration if placed at a
smooth point of a CY manifold, but D-branes get recombined into fractional branes
if placed on top of a singularity. Fractional branes conﬁgurations can be described as
a stable bound states of D3/D5/D7-branes respectively wrapping the 0/2/4-cycles
of the del Pezzo divisor hosting the D-branes conﬁguration [205].

Dimensional Reduction

In order to study the EFT arising from a stack of N D3-branes, it is necessary to
perform a Kaluza-Klein reduction [143], as we already reviewed for the bulk theory
in Sec. 2.1.5. The action governing the dynamics of a stack of N D3-branes contains
two contributions. The ﬁrst one is the non-abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action,
which in the string frame reads

E = g + B ,

(2.125)

µ3 has already been introduced in eq. (2.43), W denotes the D3-brane space-time
ﬁlling worldvolume, ξ collectively denotes the coordinates on W and ϕ : W (cid:44)→ M is
the embedding map of the D3-branes into the ten-dimensional space-time M. Fµν
denotes the ﬁeld strength of the U (N ) gauge theory described by the D3-branes
conﬁguration. Moreover we deﬁne

m = δn

(2.126)

where the six scalar ﬁelds φi parametrize the position of the D3-brane inside the
compact space, and transform in the adjoint representation of U (N ). The DBI
action provides the coupling between the open strings degrees of freedom and the
NSNS ﬁelds of the bulk theory.

The second contribution to the D3-branes action is given by the Chern-Simon

where the diﬀerential with the (cid:98) is omitted. The CS action provides the coupling

between the opens strings degrees of freedom and the RR ﬁelds of the bulk theory.

The KK reduction is a quite long procedure and it contains many subtleties.

Here we just want to emphasize the main points [143]:

• As a ﬁrst step it is necessary to compute the pull-back of the ten-dimensional
ﬁelds g and B which appear in the actions in eq.s (2.124) and (2.127). How-
ever, in order to capture all the degrees of freedom arising from a D3-branes
conﬁguration, it is necessary to perturb the background map ϕ. Schematically

ϕ → ϕ + δϕ ,

(2.129)

so that δϕ takes into account the ﬂuctuations of the D3-brane in the directions
orthogonal to its world-volume. Such a procedure is called normal coordinate
expansion.

• It is necessary to expand the square root of the determinant of the ﬁeld Qn
m,

taking into account the non-abelian nature of the ﬁelds φi, which leads to

where the . . . denote ﬁelds which vanish after taking the trace in the la-
grangian.

• In the KK reduction of the Chern-Simon action, the four-form C4 is expanded
around its background value, which is determined by the condition α = e4A.
We allow for small perturbations around this background value, which means
taking into account a small, non-ISD component for G3. As a consequence
the solution breaks supersymmetry and deviates from the class of warped

87

(cid:113)

compactiﬁcations in Tab. 2.4. We assume that this is a very small departure
from the supersymmetric background, so that we can treat it perturbatively,
without destroying the solution.

• Once the reduction has been performed, it is necessary to recast all the expres-
sions in terms of chiral superﬁelds, and then it is necessary to ﬁnd a complex
structure which is compatible with N = 1 supersymmetry. It turns out that
the complex structure J of the compact space is the correct choice. A key
point in this step is that a mixing between complex structure moduli and
open strings degrees of freedom takes place, so that K¨ahler moduli need to be
redeﬁned diﬀerently from eq. (2.78), as follows [143]

(2.131) it is possible to infer the same scaling

˜Kmn ≈ (ω1)mn

.

(2.132)

Notice that in eq. (2.131) the complex structure moduli mix with the K¨ahler moduli
in K so that the moduli space is no longer of the diagonal form as in eq. (2.84). If
warping eﬀects are taken into account as in [140], then an additional correction with
the same volume scaling as the K¨ahler matter metric in eq. (2.132) can appear. In
the present thesis we neglect this possibility.

D3-branes at Singularities

Every time a manifold features a discrete symmetry, it is possible to build a new
manifold by identifying points under the corresponding transformation. The possi-
ble ﬁxed points under the action of the transformation are singularities of the new
compactiﬁcation manifold, called orbifold singularities. Orbifold singularities are

88

the simplest singularities which can be encountered, and in particular C3/Z3 which
is equivalent to a dP0 divisor whose size is shrunk to zero, is an orbifold singularity.
In such a singularity fractional branes have to form a representation of Z3, namely
the Z3 action has to act by interchanging fractional branes placed at three image
points. A D3-brane at a singularity splits into 3 fractional branes, each of which
carrying 1/3 of the original D3-brane mass.

The interesting feature of singularities, from a phenomenological point of view,
is that by placing a stack of D3-branes on top of a singular point in the compact
space it is possible to get a chiral spectrum, starting from a non-chiral N = 4
supersymmetric theory. There is also an additional reason to consider such models.
As we discussed in Sec. 2.2.1, it is not possible to conciliate the stabilization of the
size of an internal four-cycle of the manifold with chirality, which is an essential
feature of our world [178]. As a consequence it is not possible to both build the
visible sector on top of a stack of branes wrapping a four-cycle in the geometric
regime (as the “small” cycle in the simplest LVS setup), and stabilize it through
non-perturbative eﬀects like E3-instantons or gaugino condensation on D7-branes.
A possible way-out is represented by D3-branes at singularities constructions [179].
In fact, let us assume that the visible gauge sector is hosted by a stack of D7-branes
wrapping a four-cycle (whose associated K¨ahler modulus is Tvis) inside the compact
space. The chiral nature of the observable world implies the existence of anomalous
U (1)’s, under which the modulus Tvis is charged. We assume for the simplicity of
the argument that there is only a single anomalous U (1), so that Tvis transforms as

δλTvis = Tvis + iQTvisλ ,

(2.133)

where QTvis is the charge of the modulus Tvis under the anomalous U (1), and λ is
the parameter of the transformation. It generates a D-terms scalar potential which
takes the schematic form

(cid:32)(cid:88)

such that the combination (cid:80)

vis represent the visible scalar ﬁelds, ci denotes generic coeﬃcients and ξ is
where Φi
the Tvis-dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos term. This part of the scalar potential ﬁxes Tvis
vis|2 = ξ, leaving as many ﬂat directions as the
number of visible ﬁelds charged under the anomalous U (1). This degeneracy is then
lifted by sub-leading supersymmetry breaking eﬀects, which contribute to the scalar

i ci |Φi

89

potential with terms like m2 |Φi
vis|2. In order for the visible ﬁelds not to roll down to
charge or color breaking minima, the mass squared m2 has to be positive. In such a
way the visible scalar ﬁelds are ﬁxed at Φi
vis = 0, which implies also ξ = Tvis = 0. As
a consequence the size of the four-cycle which supports the visible sector is ﬁxed at
zero size: the singularity is obtained in a dynamical way. We will study the details
of such a model in Chap. 3.

Interestingly, from the previous argument it is also possible to infer the tree-
level contribution of Tvis to the K¨ahler potential [179]. Indeed, the D-terms scalar
potential in eq. (2.134) arises from an anomalous U (1) which get massive due to the
Green-Schwarz mechanism. It is possible to compute that the mass of such a ﬁeld
is given by the string scale m2

s , and since

(2.136)

where qvis is the charge of the modulus Tvis under the anomalous U (1), while Vvis

not be computed in the EFT approach.

The crucial point is that models of D3-branes at singularities can be adjusted to
support a realistic visible sector. We report here the gauge theories which is possi-
ble to get in presence of a stack of space-time ﬁlling D3-branes, placed on top of a
generic R6/Zn singularity [99]. In terms of N = 1 supersymmetry, the ﬁelds arising
from a stack of N D3-branes can be arranged in U (N ) vector multiplets, and three
adjoint chiral multiplets Φr, whose components are the 6 real scalar ﬁelds φi of Tab.
2.8, transforming in the 6 of SU (4) (cid:39) SO(6) plus 4 adjoint fermions transforming
in the 4 of SU (4).
In order to get a non-abelian gauge theory when a stack of
N D3-branes is considered, the states reported in Tab. 2.8 for the single D3-brane
case have to be supplemented by a Chan-Paton matrix λ ≡ λij, where the indexes
i, j = 1, . . . , N refer to the branes on which open strings have their endpoints. Each
D3-brane placed on top of a R6/Zn singularity split into n fractional branes, placed
at n image points under the action of Zn. The resulting spectrum is given by states
which are invariant under the Zn action.

90

The action of Zn on fermions and scalars is given respectively by the matrices

Rferm = diag(cid:0)e2πia1/n, e2πia2/n, e2πia3/n, e2πia4/n(cid:1) ,
Rscal = diag(cid:0)e2πib1/n, e2πib2/n, e2πib3/n(cid:1) ,

where

a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 = 0 mod n ,

b1 = a2+a3 ,

b2 = a1 + a3 ,

b3 = a1 + a2 ,

(2.138)

Furthermore, the action of Zn needs to be embedded on the Chan-Paton indexes.
The embedding is provided by the matrix

i ni = nN and the matrices 1ni are the ni× ni unit matrices. The spectrum
of the gauge theory living on D3-branes at a Zn singularity is obtained by keeping

deﬁned on the states as follows

In general this spectrum is not supersymmetric, unless b1 + b2 + b3 = 0, in which
case a4 = 0 and the fermions corresponding to α = 4 turn out to transform as gaug-
inos (in the adjoint representation of U (ni)), while the fermions corresponding to
α = 1, 2, 3 transform in the same bi-fundamental representations as complex scalars.
In this case complex scalars and fermions ﬁll out a set of chiral multiplets, while
gauge bosons and gauginos compose vector multiplets of the resulting N = 1 super-
symmetric theory. The condition b1 + b2 + b3 = 0 corresponds to the requirement
that the Zn action is contained in SU (3), as expected given that it gives rise to a
supersymmetric theory.

We are interested in the case n = 3, with N = 3 D3-branes at singularities each
of which splits into 3 fractional branes placed at image points under the Z3 action,
so that ni = 3 for each i = 0, 1, 2. Generically the spectrum reported in eq. (2.143)
is not free from anomalies, and it is necessary to include D7 ﬂavour branes in the
compactiﬁcation in order to erase them. However, in the speciﬁc case with n = 3
and ni = 3 for i = 0, 1, 2 anomalies are automatically canceled [99]. The gauge
group in this case is that of a triniﬁcation model:

G = SU (3)col × SU (3)L × SU (3)R ,

and the spectrum arise from the following 27 states

3(cid:2)(3, 3, 1), (1, 3, 3), (3, 1, 3)(cid:3) .

(2.144)

(2.145)

Finally, since there is only a trivial overall U (1) which decouples, the hypercharge has
to arise from the SU (3)L×SU (3)R sector. The main problem of this model is that the
structure of Yukawa couplings always generates a wrong hierarchy for fermion masses
of the form (M, M, 0), with two heavy and one massless generations [179, 199].

2.2.3 An Explicit Global Model

In the present section we exhibit an explicit global embedding of the D3-branes at
singularities setup, in which all the consistency conditions have been checked [206].
In particular it is required that:

• moduli stabilization is performed in the LVS setup,
• the visible sector is supported by D3-branes at singularities,
• the compactiﬁcation is self-consistent (tadpole cancellation, anomaly cancel-

lation, etc.) and the EFT is trustable.

We consider Type IIB warped compactiﬁcations with O3/O7-planes. Since we re-
quire the gauge theory of the visible sector to be SU (N ), the singularity has to lie
away from the O7-plane. As a consequence it is necessary to look for a CY manifold
which contains two singularities, exchanged by the orientifold action whose ﬁxed
locus is an O7-plane. As we have discussed, LVS moduli stabilization requires at
least a couple of additional four-cycles, so that the minimal setup contains at least
four four-cycles. Finally, as explained in Sec. 2.2.2, it is required not to have D7
ﬂavour branes, in order to maximize the eﬀect of decoupling between gauge and
bulk degrees of freedom. Gauge anomaly cancellation is automatically achieved in
models of D3-branes at C3/Z3 singularities without D7 ﬂavour branes.

In [206] the authors considered a scan among CY manifolds which are hypersur-
faces in four dimensional toric ambient spaces [207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213],
looking for one which satisﬁes the above requirements. The Hodge numbers of such
a CY are h(1,1)
+ = 3 and h(1,1)− = 1. From a technical point of view the authors looked
for a CY containing two dP0 divisors exchanged by the orientifold involution. They
eventually checked that the point of the moduli space where these del Pezzo divisors
shrink to zero size lies inside the K¨ahler cone.

The CY manifold χ considered contains several divisors which we call D4, D5,
D6, D7, D8, of which D4, D7, D8 are three non-intersecting dP0 divisors. A basis
for the four-cycles can be chosen as

Γb = D6 + D7 = D4 + D5 , Γq1 = D4 , Γq2 = D7 , Γs = D8 ,

(2.146)

where the subscripts b and s refer respectively to the “big” and “small” cycles of LVS,
while qi refer to the cycles supporting the visible sector.

where

τq2 = Vol(Γq2) ,

τs = Vol(Γs) ,

τb = Vol(Γb) .

(2.148)

We summarize the D-branes/O-planes conﬁguration of the model:
• There are two non-intersecting O7-planes: one in the homology class Γb and

one in the homology class Γs.

• In order to cancel the D7-charge generated by O7-planes, four D7-branes are
placed on top of each O7-plane. This generates two hidden sectors SO(8) ×
SO(8), which can give rise to gaugino condensation.

• The visible sector is realized by placing three D3-branes on top of the two
singularities exchanged by the orientifold involution. In this way the gauge
theory obtained is a triniﬁcation model SU (3)3, which can be further broken
to the MSSM gauge group [206]. Gauge anomalies are automatically canceled.

As we have seen in Sec. 2.1.4 it is necessary to cancel the D3-branes charge.
This is achieved taking into account the D3-branes charge generated by the pres-
ence of D7-branes. Schematically, the condition that is satisﬁed by the D-branes
conﬁguration takes the following form

(2.153)

Finally qSM, qG are the charges of the moduli TSM and G under the anomalous U (1)’s
with vector multiplets VSM and VG as we already discussed in the last section.

Finally, an important point is to check whether it is possible to get a non-
perturbative eﬀect at least on top of the small cycle, in order to perform K¨ahler moduli
stabilization in the LVS setup. The presence of chiral states on the stack of D7-
branes in the homology classes Γs and Γb, can destroy the possibility of having
gaugino condensation. The simplest way to avoid this issue is by setting to zero on
both stacks of D7-branes the gauge ﬂux

F = F − B ,

(2.154)

where F denotes the gauge ﬂux of the D7-brane gauge theory. In general this is not a
straightforward step, since once the condition F = 0 is imposed on one stack of D7-
branes, it could be not possible to impose the same condition on the second stack.
However, in the properly chosen conﬁguration of [206] this is not the case, because
the divisors belonging to the homology classes Γs and Γb have no intersections. There
are two possibilities:

1. If the ﬁeld B is chosen such that Fs = 0 and Fb (cid:54)= 0, then no non-perturbative
eﬀect for Tb is generated. In this case it is possible to get a dS vacuum, since
the non-vanishing ﬂux on Γb induces a non-zero U (1) charge for Tb. As a

95

consequence a D-terms in the scalar potential is generated, whose interplay
with the F-terms part of the scalar potential leads to an uplifting contribution
of the usual AdS vacuum of LVS. This kind of solution is that explicitly built
in [206]. Further details on the de Sitter mechanism are provided in Sec. 3.1.2.
2. If the ﬁeld B is chosen in such a way that F = 0 on both Γs and Γb, depending
on the details of the model a non-perturbative eﬀect for Tb can be generated,
but in general it is not possible to get a dS vacuum without the introduction of
new elements in the compactiﬁcation, such as anti-branes at the tip of warped
throats [146] or new non-perturbative eﬀects taking place on an additional
singularity placed on top of the O7-plane [214].
In Sec. 3.1.2 we take into
account the latter possibility. A global construction for such a de Sitter sector
is still missing.

In both cases the superpotential contains a non-perturbative term for the “small”
cycle

W ⊃ Ae−asTs ,

(2.155)

which is needed in the LVS setup for K¨ahler moduli stabilization. Finally in [206] the
authors checked that in this setup it is possible to choose gauge ﬂuxes and B-ﬁeld in
order to cancel the Freed-Witten anomaly in a way consistent with the generation
of the non-perturbative superpotential terms.

In conclusion the conﬁguration of D-branes/O-planes considered in [206] gives
rise to a consistent global compactiﬁcation, in which the visible sector is realized on
top of D3-branes at singularities. The consistency of the compactiﬁcation is ensured
by tadpole cancellation, cancellation of Freed-Witten anomalies and cancellation of
gauge anomalies. As we will observe in chapter 3 in this setup it is possible to
stabilize all the closed moduli in the LVS setup, since a term as in eq. (2.155) is
always present in the superpotential. A realistic de Sitter vacuum can be achieved
thanks to the presence of hidden matter on the D7-branes wrapping the “big” cycle
of the swiss-cheese CY. It is also possible to get a de Sitter vacuum in a second
way, by exploiting a perturbative eﬀect taking place on top of a four-cycle invariant
under the orientifold involution, but this setup requires a diﬀerent CY manifold and
a complete realization of the global embedding is still missing.

Sequestered de Sitter String Models:
Soft-Terms

The simplest models of low-energy supersymmetry as a solution to the hierarchy
problem are in tension with the latest LHC results (see e.g. [215] and references
therein) which are moving the bounds for sparticle masses beyond the TeV scale.
We are then either in a situation where we accept two to three orders of magnitude
of tuning as still ‘natural’, or we are at a very particular corner in the MSSM pa-
rameter space with less ﬁne-tuning (e.g. natural SUSY [216, 217, 218], compressed
spectra [219, 220], RPV models [221, 222]), or we need alternatives to the conven-
tional MSSM. Given this, there are various avenues to explore for addressing the
electroweak hierarchy problem:

1. The simplest MSSM models (e.g. CMSSM) need to be modiﬁed at low energies
to account for particular corners in the MSSM parameter space with reduced
ﬁne-tuning. Or, one step further, extensions of the MSSM including extra
matter and/or interactions at the TeV scale may relax the tuning of the MSSM
(see e.g. [223]).

2. The MSSM is the correct description for beyond the Standard Model physics
but the hierarchy problem is addressed by diﬀerent amounts of ﬁne-tuning
through the multiverse just like the cosmological constant problem [224], where
we can distinguish the following classes:

(a) The simplest models of low-energy SUSY are realized with some two to

three orders magnitude of ﬁne-tuning.

(b) One just keeps the appealing features of low-energy SUSY of realizing the
correct DM density and gauge coupling uniﬁcation whereas the hierarchy

99

problem is no longer addressed. This proposal is commonly referred to
as Split-SUSY [225] where gauginos are at the TeV scale while the scalar
superpartners are hierarchically heavier.

(c) DM and gauge coupling uniﬁcation are achieved by other mechanisms
and the SUSY particles are at a scale far above the electroweak scale
such as an intermediate scale.

3. One can consider alternative solutions to the hierarchy problem such as com-

posite models or extra-dimensional models.

Each of these scenarios has its own virtues and demerits. The ﬁrst one aims at
avoiding ﬁne-tuning in the parameter space of the MSSM, but without a principle
on why to favor a particular extension in a UV theory, it is in some sense a tuning
in theory space which is as appealing as ﬁne-tuning in parameter space, the others
simply accept some sort of tuning.1 Given this state of aﬀairs, we are left with
the unpleasant situation that at present the best argument in favor of low-energy
SUSY is that other alternatives, like large extra-dimensions or composite models,
are looking even worse.

This is a golden opportunity for string theoretical scenarios to play a role. Being
the only explicit scenarios that provide a UV completion of the Standard Model, they
should be able to address the problems of the scenarios mentioned above, provide
guidance towards their explicit realization and maybe even suggest other alternative
avenues.

Consistent string theories are typically supersymmetric. Unfortunately, low-
energy SUSY or the MSSM are not a prediction of string theory and its potential
discovery or lack of will not directly test string theory. Moreover for a high string
scale of order 1016 GeV (as hinted by standard MSSM gauge coupling uniﬁcation),
obtaining at the same time low-energy SUSY can be a challenge for model building.
Another important feature is the string landscape which can potentially have an im-
pact on the hierarchy problem. These are very important issues which can impact
LHC and future collider observations. They need to be addressed systematically
and within a complete string framework, as we do in one speciﬁc example in the

1Particular interesting corners of parameter space for soft-terms can be obtained by invok-
ing principles such as precision gauge coupling uniﬁcation [226] or by identifying pattern in un-
derlying UV theories (e.g. realization of natural SUSY and compressed spectra in the Heterotic
mini-landscape [227, 228]).

present chapter.

Fortunately progress in the understanding of SUSY-breaking in string compact-
iﬁcations is maturing right on time to play a role. Several scenarios in which most
of the string moduli have been stabilized with SUSY-breaking and computable soft-
terms have emerged [189, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235]. Some of them are also
consistent with cosmological constraints such as the CMP and the realization of
de Sitter (dS) vacua. In particular, the LARGE Volume Scenario (LVS) [180], on
which we focus, allows for several of the above SUSY-breaking scenarios in which
soft-terms can be explicitly computed. Moreover, LVS is an ideal framework to build
globally consistent MSSM-like chiral models for explicit CY compactiﬁcations with
all closed string moduli stabilized [181, 192, 206, 236]. It is also possible to obtain
dS vacua from supersymmetric eﬀective actions [206, 214] and the string landscape
allows for a controllable ﬁne-tuning of the cosmological constant and potentially the
electroweak hierarchy problem.

In this chapter our focus shall be on sequestered models, in order to explore the
possibility of getting low-energy SUSY from string compactiﬁcations. In [182] it was
realized that soft-terms can potentially be sensitive to the mechanism responsible
for achieving a dS minimum. Lack of a controlled understanding of the way to get
dS vacua made it diﬃcult to present a complete analysis of the SUSY phenomenol-
ogy. Recently there has been progress in obtaining dS vacua from supersymmetric
eﬀective actions [192, 206, 214, 236, 237]. In this chapter we work out this depen-
dence on the uplifting mechanism in sequestered models. As previously, we assume
an MSSM spectrum from the local D-branes conﬁguration for simplicity.

We explicitly compute all soft-terms for sequestered scenarios identifying dif-
ferent cases depending on the mechanism to obtain dS vacua and the moduli-
dependence of the Kähler metric for matter ﬁelds. Broadly, we ﬁnd two classes
scenarios in which all soft-terms are of order m3/2/V and scenarios
of models:
where gaugino masses and A-terms are of this order but scalar masses are of order
m3/2/V 1/2. In both cases the numerical coeﬃcients of the soft-terms are determined
by background ﬂuxes and therefore can be tuned by scanning through the landscape.
This provides an explicit mechanism for the (small) tuning that might be necessary
to confront LHC data. In the ﬁrst class of models the spectrum is similar to stan-
dard MSSM spectra with soft-terms of the same order but with the potential of
extra non-universal ﬂux-dependent contribution. The second one gives a universal

101

Mini-Split scenario with negligible non-universalities.

The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. Sec. 3.1 contains the detailed
setup that leads to sequestered LVS models and a presentation of two mechanisms to
obtain dS vacua. We then compute the leading order expressions of the associated F-
terms and soft-masses for these scenarios in Sec. 3.2. Finally in Sec. 3.3 we comment
on possible sources of desequestering before concluding in Sec. 3.4. This chapter is
based on [1].

3.1 Sequestered LVS Scenarios

After having introduced many ingredients needed to build a phenomenologically
viable compactiﬁcation, let us summarize a setup in Type IIB CY ﬂux compacti-
ﬁcations with O3/O7-planes that leads to dS moduli stabilization à la LVS and a
visible sector sequestered from SUSY-breaking:

• The simplest LVS vacua can be obtained for a CY with negative Euler num-
ber and at least one blow-up of a point-like singularity [167], as explained in
Sec. 2.2.1. For these manifolds the volume V is of swiss-cheese type as in eq.
(2.111). In the explicit case of Sec. 2.2.3 the intersection numbers are given in
eq. (2.147), but the results of this chapter are independent of the particular
values of αi.2

• The visible sector can be realized with appropriate D-branes conﬁgurations
on blow-up moduli. Concrete D-branes realizations with D3/D7 branes at
del Pezzo singularities can lead to interesting gauge/matter extensions of the
MSSM. As qualitatively discussed in Sec. 2.2.2 the size of the associated four-
cycle can shrink to zero value due to D-terms stabilization. Because of this
shrinking, the F-term of the corresponding blow-up Kähler modulus is vanish-
ing at leading order giving rise to a sequestered scenario. We report all the
details of this mechanism in Sec. 3.1.1 In order to get the maximal degree of
sequestering, in this thesis we consider D3-branes at singularities constructions
without D7 ﬂavour branes.

• In order to realize a dS vacuum one introduces further ingredients in the com-
pactiﬁcation. Here we concentrate on two options: (i) Hidden sector matter
ﬁelds on the large cycle which acquire non-zero F-terms because of D-terms

2It is possible to implement LVS in CYs which have a more general volume form [167] but this

does not alter the structure of soft-masses and so we do not consider these cases.

102

ﬁxing [206]; (ii) E(-1) instantons at a second singularity whose blow-up mode
develops non-vanishing F-term due to new dilaton-dependent non-perturbative
eﬀects [214]. These mechanisms will be discussed respectively in Sec. 3.1.2 and
in Sec. 3.1.2.

The setup with de Sitter scenario arising from matter ﬁelds on the large cycle has
been realized in concrete CY orientifold compactiﬁcations with D3(/D7) branes at
singularities [192, 206, 236] that satisfy all global consistency conditions (e.g. tad-
pole cancellation), as reported in Sec. 2.2.3.

The minimal setup that allows this realization includes at least four Kähler
moduli: a ‘big’ four-cycle Tb controlling the size of the CY volume, a ‘small’ blow
up mode Ts supporting non-perturbative eﬀects, the visible sector cycle TSM and
its orientifold image G. These last two moduli are associated to two del Pezzo
divisors which collapse to zero size due to D-terms ﬁxing3 and are exchanged by the
orientifold involution. This setup leads to h(1,1)
+ = 3 and h(1,1)− = 1 with the Kähler
moduli already reported in eq. (2.150).

N = 1 Supergravity Eﬀective Field Theory
In this section we brieﬂy review the low-energy eﬀective action relevant for our
construction in the language of 4D N = 1 supergravity, that we have already studied
in Sec. 2. We write the expressions in such a way that a couple of alternative
scenarios for de Sitter sectors are included, the ﬁrst one of which has already a fully
consistent global embedding [206] as explained in Sec. 2.2.3. Including de Sitter
and matter contributions, the superpotential takes the following form

W = W0(U, S) + As(U, S) e−asTs + WdS + Wmatter .

(3.1)

As explained in Sec. 2.2.1, the pre-factor As(U, S) depends on both complex struc-
ture moduli U and the dilaton S, and it is an O(1) function.4 The term WdS involves
the contribution from the mechanism used to obtain a dS vacuum (see Sec. 3.1.2)
while Wmatter is the visible sector superpotential

Wmatter = µ(M )HuHd +

Yαβγ(M )C αC βC γ + ··· ,

(3.2)

3The positivity of soft scalar masses for visible sector ﬁelds ﬁxes all remaining ﬂat-directions

after D-terms stabilization [206].

4The dependence on S and U-moduli is structurally diﬀerent, i.e. the dependence on the dilaton

is generated when including the back-reaction of sources and warping on the geometry [238].

103

where we denoted the moduli as M and the MSSM superﬁelds as C α. Moreover,
the dots refer to higher dimensional operators. We also separated the two higgs
doublets Hu and Hd from the rest of matter ﬁelds in the moduli-dependent µ-term.
Because of the holomorphicity of W and the perturbative shift-symmetry of the ax-
ionic components of the Kähler moduli, the Yukawa couplings and the µ-term can
depend only on S and U at the perturbative level with the T -moduli appearing only
non-perturbatively. We discuss this dependence in more detail in Sec. 3.2 and 3.3.

For the reasons explained in Sec. 2.2.2 [179, 182], we assume the following form

where ˆξ ≡ ξs3/2, the λ’s are O(1) coeﬃcients, Kcs(U ) is the tree-level Kähler po-
tential for complex structure moduli and KdS encodes the dependence on the sector
responsible for obtaining a dS vacuum (see Sec. 3.1.2). The matter Kähler potential
Kmatter is taken to be

Kmatter = ˜Kα(M, M )C

α

C α + [Z(M, M )HuHd + h.c.] .

(3.4)

We assume at this stage that the matter metric is ﬂavour diagonal beyond the
leading order structure which was highlighted in [239].5 The only exception is that
we allow for the higgs bilinear to appear in Kmatter which we parametrize with the
function Z. Note that ˜Kα is the matter metric for the visible sector which we will
parametrize as [182]

will be given in Sec. 3.2.2). The c’s are taken as constants for simplicity while p
is taken to be positive in order to have a well-behaved metric in the singular limit
b, τSM → 0. As they can in principle depend on U and S, we comment in due course
on the inﬂuence on the soft-terms of such a dependence. The appearance of the higgs

5Sub-leading ﬂavour oﬀ-diagonal entries which can in principle appear [240] are taken to be
absent. This is motivated by the appearance of additional anomalous U (1) symmetries in D-branes
models, in particular also in the context of del Pezzo singularities [191].

bilinear and its potential parametrization are discussed in Sec. 3.2.3 when we analyze
the µ-term in this scenario. In general the functions fα(U, S) could be non-universal.
Such non-universality can have interesting phenomenological implications (e.g. mass
hierarchies among families of sfermion masses needed for a realization of natural
SUSY). As we are interested in soft-terms arising for D-branes at singularities, we
take the gauge kinetic function to be

fa = δaS + κa TSM ,

(3.6)

where δa are universal constants for Zn singularities but can be non-universal for
more general singularities.

3.1.1 Moduli Stabilization

As outlined earlier in this section, we stabilize the moduli following the LVS pro-
cedure. The complex structure moduli and the dilaton are ﬁxed at tree-level by
background ﬂuxes while the Kähler moduli are ﬁxed using higher order corrections
to the eﬀective action [236]. In this section we ﬁrst explain the D-terms stabilization
in detail, and then we perform the F-terms stabilization taking into account both
the eﬀects coming from the de Sitter sector, and the small shift of the supersym-
metric minimum DSW0 = DU aW0 = 0 due to non-perturbative and α(cid:48)-corrections
which induces a non-vanishing IASD component of the three-form ﬂux G3.

D-terms Stabilization

The Kähler moduli where the visible sector D-branes conﬁguration is located are
stabilized using D-terms which are the leading order contribution to the potential.
Remaining ﬂat directions are stabilized using sub-leading F-terms contributions. To
set the notation, let us review D-terms stabilization [206]. The moduli TSM and G
are charged under two anomalous U (1) symmetries with charges q1 and q2. The
corresponding D-terms potential reads

(3.8)

(3.9)

The vanishing D-terms condition ﬁxes therefore aSM and b in terms of visible sector
matter ﬁelds. The remaining ﬂat directions are ﬁxed by sub-leading F-terms con-
tributions which give vanishing VEVs to the C α if they develop non-tachyonic soft
masses from SUSY-breaking [206].6 Hence the D-terms potential (3.7) vanishes in
the vacuum since it is ﬁxed to a supersymmetric minimum at ξ1 = ξ2 = 0. This
corresponds to the singular limit τSM = b = 0. In turn, the axions aSM and c are
eaten up by the two U (1) gauge bosons in the process of anomaly cancellation.

F-terms Stabilization

F-terms stabilization proceeds as explained in Sec. 2.2.1. The de Sitter sector gen-
erates a correction to the minimum in eq. (2.117)

τ 3/2
s =

ˆξ
2

[1 + fdS(s)] ,

(3.10)

where fdS is a sub-dominant function of s = 1
which depends on the particular
4asτs
mechanism used to obtain a dS vacuum, as reported below. The relation (3.10)
implies that at the minimum (neglecting fdS)

4 (ass)3/2 ∼ O(cid:104)

(lnV)3/2(cid:105) (cid:29) 1 .

ˆξ (cid:39)

(3.11)

Given that the potential (2.115) depends on S and U (via As(U, S) and s-dependent
α(cid:48) eﬀects), the minimum (2.114) is slightly shifted from its supersymmetric locus.
This shift is fundamental for the soft-term computation in sequestered scenarios
since non-vanishing F-terms of U and S at sub-leading order can actually provide
the main contribution to soft-terms [182].

6If the soft scalar masses of some C α are tachyonic, they develop non-zero VEVs (which could
be phenomenologically allowed for some Standard Model singlets) that, in turn, induce non-zero
FI-terms [236]. However τSM and b would still be ﬁxed in the singular regime since their VEVs
would be volume-suppressed [236].

106

Shift in the Minimum

Let us try to estimate the shift of S and U from their supersymmetric minimum
(2.114) because of α(cid:48) and non-perturbative eﬀects. The Kähler covariant derivative
of the total superpotential evaluated at the minimum (2.116) and (3.10) reads (we
neglect O(s) eﬀects)

DSW (cid:39) DSW0|ξ=0 − 3 ˆξW0

4sV [1 + ss∂s ln As(U, S)] .

(3.12)

Since we do not know the functional dependence of As(U, S) and since the WdS term
in eq. (3.1) can also potentially shift the dilaton minimum, it is not possible for
us to compute this shift explicitly. We will parametrize it by using the parameter
ωS(U, S) deﬁned as

DSW = −3ωS(U, S)

4

ˆξW0
sV .

(3.13)

The dependence of As(U, S) on the complex structure moduli is also responsible
for shifting the U-moduli from their supersymmetric minimum. After imposing the
minimization conditions, the total DU aW looks like (denoting u ≡ Re(U ))

DU aW (cid:39) DU aW0|ξ=0 − 3 ˆξW0

4V s∂u [Kcs(U ) + ln As(U, S)] ,

(3.14)

and so we can parametrize this shift by ωU a(U, S) as

DU aW = −3ωU a(U, S)

4

ˆξW0
sV ⇒ DU aW =

ωU a(U, S)
ωS(U, S)

DSW ∼ O(V−1) ,

(3.15)

where both ωS and ωU a are expected to be O(1) functions of S and U. Note that
both functions ωS/U a depend also on the dS mechanism. These corrections give rise
to O (V−4) contributions to the scalar potential, and then as already mentioned the
components
EFT is self-consistent. They generate a non-vanishing IASD and G(0,3)
of the three-form ﬂux G3, which can be seen as small perturbations around the
supersymmetric background.

3.1.2 Scenarios for de Sitter Vacua

In this section we review two mechanisms which can lead to dS vacua in LVS.

107

Figure 3.1: Pictorial sketch of our CY setup for dS vacua from hidden matter ﬁelds.

Case 1: dS Vacua from Hidden Matter Fields

In the LVS setting, dS vacua can arise if some hidden matter ﬁelds acquire non-
vanishing F-terms which provide a positive deﬁnite contribution to the scalar po-
tential [206]. The models constructed in [206] provide globally consistent explicit
examples of string models with a semi-realistic visible sector, moduli stabilization
and a positive cosmological constant (see Fig. 3.1 for a pictorial sketch of this setup).

Generically, the choice of B2 which cancels the Freed-Witten anomaly on the
small cycle Ts, leads to non-vanishing gauge ﬂuxes on the big cycle Tb. As a con-
sequence, Tb acquires a non-zero U (1)-charge qb generating a moduli-dependent FI-
term. The D-terms potential becomes (focusing for simplicity on a single matter
ﬁeld φdS with Kähler metric KdS = s−1|φdS|2 [242, 243] and U (1)-charge qφ)

For natural O(1) values of all underlying parameters, this relation gives a minimum

scenario can be generically obtained in presence of D7-branes with non-zero gauge
ﬂux, which lead to a T-brane conﬁguration [245]. Expanding the D7-branes action
around the T-brane background gives a positive deﬁnite term in the scalar potential,

which can be used to get a de Sitter vacuum.

Case 2: dS Vacua from Non-perturbative Eﬀects at Singularities

Reference [214] provided a novel method for obtaining LVS dS vacua (see Fig. 3.2 for
a pictorial sketch of this setup). The additional contribution to the scalar potential
needed to achieve a positive cosmological constant arises from non-perturbative
eﬀects at singularities (like gaugino condensation on space-time ﬁlling D3-branes or
E(-1) instantons). These eﬀects generate a new contribution to the superpotential
in eq. (3.1) of the form

WdS = AdS(U, S) e−adS(S+κdSTdS) .

(3.25)

Because of the presence of an additional Kähler modulus, the Kähler potential (3.3)
has to be supplemented with

KdS = λdS

τ 2
dSV ,

110

(3.26)

with τdS = Re(TdS). This blow-up mode can be ﬁxed in the singular regime by min-
imizing the hidden sector D-terms potential (focusing for simplicity on canonically
normalized hidden ﬁelds φh,i with charges qh,i under an anomalous U (1))

3.2 F-terms and Soft-terms

In this section we list the leading order contributions to the F-terms relevant for the
computation of all soft-terms, and we also report the sub-leading corrections to the
F-terms in a subsection. After deﬁning our parametrization for the Kähler matter
metric in local and ultra-local scenarios, we then calculate the soft-terms.

3.2.1 Summary of F-terms

The general supergravity expression for an F-term is [246, 247]

F I = eK/2K IJ DJ W .

(3.34)

The exact expressions for the F-terms are rather complicated. Considerable simpli-
ﬁcations occur if we perform an expansion in V−1 and s. We also factor out the
gravitino mass which is given by the following expression

condition (3.32))

Finally, the F-terms associated to the MSSM cycles TSM and G vanish:

(3.39)

(3.40)

This result is crucial for sequestering since the dominant F-terms are then associ-
ated with moduli which couple weakly to the visible sector via Planck-suppressed
interactions.8

Sub-leading Corrections to F-terms

In the present section we ﬁrst describe the shift of the LVS minimum after including
an extra term responsible to achieve a dS vacuum, and then provide sub-leading
corrections to F-terms. As described in Sec. 3.1.2, the mechanism which realizes a
dS vacuum gives rise eﬀectively to an extra term of the form

VdS =

r
V m

with r > 0 and m < 3 .

(3.41)

8TSM and G can develop non-zero F-terms only in the presence of tachyonic scalar masses [236].

However, also in this case, their contribution to soft-terms turns out to be negligible.

113

We are interested in minimizing the combined system

V = VO(V−3) + VdS ,

(3.42)

with the additional constraint of vanishing vacuum energy. This constraint relates
the coeﬃcient r with the tunable ﬂux parameters in the LVS potential such as W0
or gs. A concrete dS scenario, such as the ones in Sec. 3.1.2, typically ﬁxes r by
construction with only moderate tuning. However the real tuning can be achieved
by simply tuning the ﬂux superpotential and the string coupling in agreement with
the ﬂux landscape.

The expressions for the moduli VEVs are largely independent on the way to get
dS vacua. In fact, the relation (2.116) is generic whereas the expression (3.10) for
the VEV of τs depends on the way to get a dS vacuum only at sub-leading order.
The exact minimum for τs is given by

eﬀects at singularities (m = 1). Note that as a consequence of the shift in τs, also
the overall volume in (2.116) is shifted and, as the shift is in the exponential, this
shift can be parametrically large.

Equipped with the minimum, we can evaluate the F-terms. To simplify the
notation we factor out an overall factor of the gravitino mass m3/2 which is given

Our analysis of soft-terms will distinguish between two classes of models: local and
ultra-local. This classiﬁcation is motivated by locality arguments already discussed
in Sec. 2.2.2: the K¨ahler matter metric should scale as ˜Kα ∼ V−2/3 at leading order.
In the present section we expand the constraint on the K¨ahler matter metric coming
from the structure of physical Yukawa couplings in eq. (2.121) at sub-leading order,
and we get (for τSM = b = C α = 0)

˜Kα = hα(U, S) eK/3 (cid:39) hα(U, S) eKcs/3

where hα(U, S) is an unknown function of U and S and in the approximation we focus
on the ﬁrst sub-leading order corrections, e.g. neglecting higher order corrections of

O(cid:0)1/V 8/3(cid:1). Note that this result has the same volume scaling of our formula for

the matter metric (3.5) which for τSM = b = 0 reduces to

˜Kα =

fα(U, S)
V 2/3

1 − cs

ˆξ
V + ˜KdS

≡ fα(U, S) ˜K .

(3.51)

As found in [182], our soft-terms computation is sensitive to the form of ˜Kα− be-
yond leading order in a V−1 expansion. There is no reason to expect that (3.50) still
holds beyond leading order since we cannot use locality to ﬁx the form of ˜Kα (al-
though there is some evidence from perturbative string computations [197]). It was

115

(cid:32)

(cid:33)

noted in [182] that the relation (3.50) has interesting implications for the soft-terms.
Guided by this, we organize our analysis of models into two classes of phenomeno-
logical models:

• Local: We call a scenario ‘local’ if (3.50) holds only to leading order in V−1;
• Ultra-local: We call a scenario ‘ultra-local’ if (3.50) holds exactly.

If we parametrize ˜KdS as ˜KdS = cdSKdS, comparing (3.50) with (3.51), we ﬁnd that
in the ultra-local case

fα(U, S) =

hα(U, S) eKcs/3

(2s)1/3

and

cs = cdS =

1
3

.

(3.52)

Subleading deviations from the approximation in (3.50) can be accounted for by
small changes in cs and cdS at the appropriate sub-leading order.

3.2.3 Soft-terms

We now proceed to compute all soft-terms distinguishing between ultra-local and
local scenarios. Throughout this section we work to leading order in V−1 and s.

• Gaugino masses

The general expression for gaugino masses in gravity mediation is

Ma =

1

2Re (fa)

F I∂Ifa ,

(3.53)

where fa = δaS + κa TSM is the gauge kinetic function as in (3.6). As F TSM = 0,
we obtain universal gaugino masses, M1 = M2 = M3 = M1/2, which are
generated by the dilaton F-term. Potential non-universalities can arise through
anomaly mediated contributions which turn out to be sub-leading (see Sec. 3.3
for more details). The leading order expression for the gaugino masses is

(3.54)

Note that this leading order result depends on the shift of the dilaton minimum
induced by α(cid:48) and non-perturbative eﬀects (see Sec. 3.1.1). We neglect possible
phases of gaugino masses. We will return to this question in the context of
the low-energy analysis of soft-terms [2].

116

• Scalar masses

Scalar masses in gravity mediation receive both F- and D-terms contributions.
Let us study them separately, presenting their leading order expressions.

1. F-terms contributions

Assuming a diagonal Kähler matter metric as in (3.4), the general expres-
sion for the F-terms contributions to scalar masses in gravity mediation
is [247]

V

∼ m3/2M1/2 ,

(3.56)

The dominant contribution to this expression comes from the F-term of
Tb. More precisely, the leading term of F Tb in (3.36) together with the
leading term of ˜K in (3.51) give a contribution which cancels against
3/2 in (3.56) because of the underlying no-scale structure. The ﬁrst
m2
non-vanishing term in (3.56) originates from the leading term of F Tb to-
gether with the ﬁrst sub-leading correction to ˜K. On the other hand, the
sub-leading correction to F Tb in (3.36) yields a contribution suppressed
by s, and so turns out to be negligible.

Scalar masses are universal since they get generated by the F-term of Tb.
Non-universal eﬀects can arise from F S and F U a but they are volume
3/2/V 2. If cs >
suppressed since they would give contributions of order m2
1/3, the scalar masses are non-tachyonic.

one takes the ultra-local limit cs = 1/3.9 In fact, there is a general argu-

where we used the fact that VF = KIJ F IF
V0 = VF,0 + VD,0 and setting the cosmological constant to zero (in the dS
constructions of Sec. 3.1.2 we showed how to cancel V0 at O(V−3) but
this can in principle be done at any order in the V−1 expansion), VF,0 can
be traded for VD,0, and we so shall include it in our analysis of D-terms
contributions to scalar masses.

On the other hand, if the functions hα(S, U ) are not constants, there is a
non-vanishing contribution from the F-terms of the dilaton and the com-
plex structure moduli at O(V−2). Using (3.37), the S and U-dependent
contribution to scalar masses turns out to be

2. D-terms contributions

Assuming a diagonal Kähler matter metric as in (3.4), the general expres-
sion for the D-terms contributions to scalar masses in gravity mediation

Given that this result depends on the value of the D-terms potential at the
minimum, this contribution depends on the way to achieve a dS vacuum.
As explained in Sec. 3.1.1, the VEV of the D-terms potential associated
to visible sector U (1)s is vanishing in the absence of tachyonic scalars.10

10Even in the presence of tachyonic scalars, the contribution to scalar masses from visible sector
D-terms turns out to be a negligible eﬀect since visible matter ﬁelds, τSM and b would still be

dS case 1 : In the dS case 1 of Sec. 3.1.2 the relevant D-term is the one
associated with the anomalous U (1) living on the big cycle. As can be
seen from (3.21), VD,0 scales as V−10/3 which is sub-dominant with respect
to the ﬁrst term in (3.59) that gives

In the local limit, this result is suppressed with

hand, in the ultra-local limit, this D-terms contribution dominates over
the F-terms one given in (3.58) which scales as m2
3/22. Hence it leads to
universal and non-tachyonic scalar masses.

dS case 2 : In the dS case 2 of Sec. 3.1.2 the relevant D-term is the one
associated with the anomalous U (1) which belongs to the hidden sector
responsible for achieving a dS vacuum. In this case both terms in (3.59)
have the same scaling since

As can be seen from (3.33), VD,0 scales as V−4. Hence in the local limit
the D-terms contribution is sub-leading with respect to the F-terms one
given in (3.56) which scales as V−3. In the ultra-local limit the F-terms
contribution to scalar masses is given by (3.57). Adding −VF,0/3 = VD,0/3
to (3.61) we ﬁnd that the total D-terms contribution to scalar masses
vanishes in the ultra-local limit once we impose cdS = 1/3 as in (3.52)

Summary of the results for scalar masses
Let us summarize our results for soft scalar masses. The expression for
0 in the local limit does not depend on the way to obtain a dS vacuum
m2
since in each case it is given by the F-terms contribution (3.56) that scales
as V−3. Scalar masses are non-tachyonic if cs > 1/3 and universal. On
the other hand, the result for the ultra-local limit depends on the dS
mechanism. In the dS case 1 of Sec. 3.1.2, scalar masses get generated by
the D-terms contribution (3.60) which has again an overall V−3 scaling
but with an s suppression with respect to the local case. Scalar masses
turn out to be non-tachyonic and universal. On the contrary, in the dS
case 2 of Sec. 3.1.2, the main contribution to scalar masses comes from
F-terms and it is given by (3.58) which scales as V−4. This result could
potentially lead to tachyonic and non-universal scalar masses depending
on the exact functional dependence of the functions hα(U, S).

• A-terms

For the current discussion, we assume that the Yukawa couplings Yαβγ receive
no non-perturbative contributions from the Kähler moduli and are hence only
functions of the complex structure moduli and the dilaton Yαβγ = Yαβγ(U, S).
The trilinear A-terms in gravity mediation receive both F- and D-terms con-
tributions. The D-terms contributions turn out to be zero for vanishing VEVs
of visible sector matter ﬁelds [248]. On the other hand, the general formula
for the F-terms contribution is [247]

F-terms of Tb, S and U.

Aαβγ from F Tb vanishes, as can be seen at leading order in (3.64) by setting
cs = 1/3 and fα = hα eKcs/3(2s)−1/3. In this limit, the general expression (3.63)

• ˆµ and B ˆµ terms

Let us discuss diﬀerent eﬀects that can contribute to the superpotential and
Kähler potential higgs bi-linear terms. Whether they are present or not is
model-dependent and a concrete realization or combination of various mecha-
nisms might not be possible. The following list should be understood as a list
of possible eﬀects that can lead to a non-vanishing µ-term. The canonically
normalized ˆµ and B ˆµ-terms receive contributions from both Kähler potential
and superpotential eﬀects. Let us discuss these two diﬀerent eﬀects separately.

1. Kähler potential contributions

Non-zero ˆµ and B ˆµ get generated from a non-vanishing pre-factor Z in
the matter Kähler potential (3.4) [249, 250]. Their general expression in
gravity mediation is [247, 248]

Motivated by the fact that we are at the singular regime, we take Z of
the same form as the matter metric (3.5) with fα(U, S) replaced by a dif-
ferent unknown function of S and U which we denote γ(U, S). We stress
that Z = γ(U, S) ˜K is just the simplest ansatz for Z given our present
knowledge but its form could in general be diﬀerent from ˜Kα.11

Let us compute the leading expressions (in an expansion in V−1 and s)
for both ˆµ and B ˆµ in the local and ultra-local limit.

The dominant contributions to (3.69) come from the F-terms of Tb, S and

Non-perturbative eﬀects: Non-perturbative eﬀects can generate in the
low-energy action an eﬀective µ-term of the form (up to pre-factors)

W ⊃ e−aT HuHd ⇒ µeﬀ = e−aT ,

(3.80)

if the cycle τ = Re(T ) is in the geometric regime [256] or

W ⊃ e−b(S+κT )HuHd ⇒ µeﬀ = e−b(S+κT ) ,

(3.81)

τ → 0 [257].
if the cycle τ = Re(T ) is in the singular regime, i.e.
Note that there are two distinct classes of non-perturbative contributions
leading to the above EFT coupling:
if the higgs bi-linear is forbidden
by anomalous U (1) symmetries, charged instanton contributions for in-
stance via ED3 can realize such a coupling [256, 257]. Alternatively, if

124

the higgs-bilinear is forbidden by an approximate global symmetry of the
local model, this global symmetry is broken by compactiﬁcation eﬀects.
For the latter case, ref. [198] studied the topological conditions under
which non-perturbative eﬀects of the form (3.80) and (3.81) contribute
to the eﬀective action. If T is a bulk cycle, the coupling (3.80) is always
generated but in our case it would be negligible since this eﬀect would
be proportional to e−V 2/3. On the other hand, if T is the blow-up of a
local singularity, the couplings (3.80) and (3.81) get generated only if this
divisor shares a homologous two-cycle with the blow-up mode TSM of the
MSSM singularity. This condition is not satisﬁed if either T or TSM is a
very simple divisor like a dP0 which has been used in the explicit global
models of [206] and [236].

If in both cases the appropriate conditions are satisﬁed, both (3.80)
and (3.81) would lead to a non-vanishing contribution which can be
parametrized as follows

ˆµ (cid:39) cµ,W (U, S)

MP
V n+ 1

and

B ˆµ (cid:39) cB,W (U, S)

(3.82)

where in (3.80) we have set T = Ts and a = nas with n > 0, while in
(3.81) we have parametrized b = nas recalling that s (cid:39) τs from (3.10).
cµ,W and cB,W are constants which absorb the dependence on the pre-
factor of the instanton contribution, the complex structure moduli and
the dilaton. Note that for diﬀerent values of n non-perturbative eﬀects
could generate ˆµ and B ˆµ in the complete range interesting for MSSM
phenomenology regardless of the size of the other soft-terms. However
these eﬀects can be in competition with Kähler potential contributions
for n ≥ 5/3.

Background ﬂuxes: Primitive (1, 2) IASD ﬂuxes can generate ˆµ for D3-
branes at singularities [143, 258, 259]. However, given that their contri-
bution is proportional to the F-terms of the complex structure moduli,
this eﬀect has already been included in the contributions from the Kähler
potential. In other words, direct computations of soft-terms by reducing
the D3-brane action in a ﬂuxed background show that µ = 0 [143].

125

3. Anomalous U (1) symmetries

A term proportional to HuHd in K or W could be forbidden in the pres-
ence of an anomalous U (1) symmetry.
In this case, the only way to
generate a higgs bilinear would be to multiply this term by an operator
involving a U (1)-charged ﬁeld which makes the whole contribution gauge
invariant. As already discussed above, the only closed string moduli that
can lead to such an eﬀect are Kähler moduli.

(cid:18)Φ

(cid:19)m

Λ

Alternatively, the U (1)-charged ﬁeld could be an open string mode Φ
appearing in K and W in a gauge invariant combination of the form (Λ
denotes the appropriate moduli-dependent cut-oﬀ)

K ⊃

HuHd ,

W ⊃ Φm

Λm−1 HuHd .

(3.83)

Thus the ﬁeld Φ has to be an MSSM singlet since a higgs bilinear gets
generated only when Φ develops a non-zero VEV breaking the U (1) sym-
metry. However, as can be seen from eqs.
(3.7) and (3.8), D-terms
stabilization ﬁxes the VEV of Φ in terms of τSM: |Φ|2 ∝ τSM/V, and so
the couplings in (3.83) would give rise to eﬀective µ and Z-terms which
depend only on closed string moduli

Zeﬀ ∝ 1
Λm

µeﬀ ∝ 1
Λm−1

(cid:17)m/2

(cid:16) τSMV

.

(3.84)

Once the cut-oﬀ Λ is explicitly written in terms of T -moduli, one could
plug (3.84) into the standard supergravity formulas to work out the ﬁnal
contribution to ˆµ and B ˆµ. The result will depend on the VEV and the
F-term of TSM. As discussed in [236], Φ needs to receive tachyonic con-
tribution from soft-terms in order for TSM to develop a non-zero VEV. If
this condition is satisﬁed, τSM ∼ V−1 implying F TSM ∼ V−2 for the local
case and τSM ∼ V−3 implying F TSM ∼ V−4 for the ultra-local case. This
eﬀect corresponds to switching on an FI-term, and so to breaking the
anomalous U (1) by moving slightly away from the singularity. However
in both cases the VEV of τSM is smaller than unity, and so we are still
consistently in the singular regime.

Given that all these results are clearly model-dependent and require
physics beyond the MSSM, at this stage we do not pursue these options

126

in more detail and leave them for future work. Let us just mention that
the only case where the eﬀective µ-term in (3.84) does not depend on Λ
is for m = 1. In this situation ˆµ would scale as V−4/3 in the local case
and as V−7/3 in the ultra-local case. If instead Φ does not receive tachy-
onic contributions from soft-terms, another option would be to consider
models where Φ develops a non-zero VEV because of radiative eﬀects.

3.2.4 Summary of Soft-terms

Let us summarize our results for the soft-terms in the two cases to obtain dS vacua
(see also Table 3.1). Given that in each case the gaugino masses turn out to have
the same value, we will use M1/2 as a useful parameter which can be rewritten as

where c1/2 is a ﬂux-dependent tunable coeﬃcient. We will state our results for the
model-independent case where ˆµ and B ˆµ are generated from moduli induced Kähler
potential contributions. If these contributions are absent (for example if these terms
are forbidden by anomalous U (1) symmetries), then ˆµ and B ˆµ can take diﬀerent
values because of model-dependent contributions from either K or W as previously
discussed. Let us discuss the local and ultra-local limits separately.

Gaugino masses, A-terms and the ˆµ-term take the same value in each case whereas
scalar masses and hence the B ˆµ-term are model-dependent. The coeﬃcients c are
ﬂux-dependent and can generically take diﬀerent values in each scenario presented
here while n is a positive model-dependent parameter. They can be tuned to com-
pare with data. Local and ultra-local 1 cases give a Split-SUSY spectrum while
ultra local 2 implies a standard MSSM spectrum with soft-masses of the same order
and possible small non-universalities due to the ﬂux-dependent parameters c.

(3.88)

Clearly, the local limit and the dS case 1 for the ultra-local limit correspond to
typical (mini-)Split-SUSY scenarios whereas the dS case 2 for the ultra-local limit
reproduces a standard MSSM picture with universal gaugino masses and soft masses
all of the same order. If the ﬂux-dependent coeﬃcients for the scalar masses are uni-
versal (c0)α = c0, a standard CMSSM scenario emerges. Non-universalities in the
ﬂux-dependent coeﬃcients can lead to interesting soft-terms patterns such as in
NUHM or natural SUSY scenarios. We discuss the dark matter phenomenology
related to these scenarios in Chap. 4 [2].

For illustrative purposes, we just mention here two simple benchmark models for

the dS case 2 in the ultra-local limit. Setting all the β’s to zero, we ﬁnd

if the holomorphic Yukawas do not depend on S. This leads to a typical natural
SUSY scenario for example if we allow mHu to be slightly larger than m0 together
with a light third generation [262]. This can be done by considering the more general

case with non-zero β’s and allowing for a U-dependence in fα. The ln(cid:0)MP/m3/2

(cid:1)

suppression of ˆµ with respect to m0 comes from sub-leading contributions to ˆµ from
F Ts.

3.3 Possible Sources of Desequestering

There is a general belief that in any supergravity theory once SUSY is broken all
sparticles should get a mass at least of the order of the scale determined by the split
in the gravity multiplet. In particular, all soft masses are expected to be of order
the gravitino mass. Furthermore, if for some reason some of the sparticle masses
are found to be smaller than m3/2 at tree level, since SUSY no longer protects these
masses against quantum corrections, they should be lifted to a loop factor times
m3/2. So soft masses are expected to be at most one order of magnitude lighter
than the gravitino mass but not much smaller.12 Eﬀects which tend to push the soft
masses to the scale of the gravitino mass are referred to as sources of desequestering.
In this section we will argue that our models can be stable against desequestering
eﬀects.

12This separation between m3/2 and soft masses occurs for example in the case of mirage (mixed

moduli and anomaly) mediation [263, 264].

129

3.3.1 Loop Corrections

For sequestered string scenarios, it is natural to expect that loop corrections bring
soft masses to a magnitude of order a loop factor times m3/2. However there can be
exceptions since the couplings can be Planck suppressed. A detailed calculation of
loop corrections to the mass of bulk scalars like the volume modulus (its tree level
mass mV ∼ m3/2/V 1/2 is hierarchically smaller than m3/2) was presented in [265].

The size of loop corrections can be estimated by realizing that, if SUSY is broken,
loop corrections to the mass should be given by the heaviest particles circulating in
the loop (or the cut-oﬀ scale) which is the Kaluza-Klein scale MKK ∼ MP/V 2/3. In
the absence of SUSY there is a need of a SUSY-breaking insertion (a spurion ﬁeld
representing the relevant F-term) in the loop and the correction to the mass is at
most

δm = αloop

MKKm3/2

MP

∼ αloop

W0V 5/3 (cid:28) αloopm3/2 ,

(3.91)

with αloop ∼ g2/(16π2) a loop factor. Note that the ratio δm/m ∼ αloopV−1/6 is very
small and therefore the volume modulus mass is stable against loop corrections.

For matter ﬁelds located at the Standard Model brane, loop corrections should be
even further suppressed. The eﬀective ﬁeld theory on the brane is supersymmetric
and feels the eﬀects of SUSY-breaking in the bulk only via Planck suppressed cou-
plings. Therefore masses as small as Msoft ∼ W0/V 2 are still stable under standard
loop corrections (since volume suppressed brane-bulk couplings imply δMsoft (cid:28) δm).

Over the years explicit calculations have been performed estimating loop cor-
rections to soft masses in no-scale and general gravity mediated models. See for
example [266, 267] in which loop corrections to scalar and gaugino masses were
estimated in supergravity and M-theory frameworks with results of order δm ∼
3/2/MP ∼ αloopMP/V 2. More recently, explicit calculations for gravitino loop
αloopm2
contributions to gaugino masses was performed in [268]. The diagrams are quadrat-
ically divergent and proportional to the gravitino mass:

130

corrects the gaugino masses to order δM1/2 ≤ αloopMP/V 2 which is smaller than the
sequestered gaugino masses M1/2 ∼ MP/V 2.

This behavior of sequestered models motivated the work of Randall and Sun-
drum to introduce anomaly mediation. However, as we will illustrate below, the
approximate no-scale structure of LVS makes anomaly mediated corrections to soft-
terms sub-leading (they vanish identically for no-scale models) in generic points of
parameter space.

3.3.2 Anomaly Mediated Contributions

In this section we examine anomaly mediated contributions to soft-terms and com-
pute their strength in the dS constructions discussed in Sec. 3.1.2. The anomaly
mediated gaugino masses [269] are given by13

Therefore in both cases the anomaly mediated contribution is loop suppressed with
respect to the moduli mediated one. This result is the consequence of the approxi-
mate no-scale structure of LVS models.

A more careful analysis is needed for a very particular point in the underlying
S → 0, i.e. in the very tuned situation where the F-term of the
parameter space: ω(cid:48)
dilaton is vanishing at leading order because of a special compensation between the
contribution to F S from DSW and DTbW . In this case the leading contribution to
gaugino masses given in (3.54) is zero and the ﬁrst non-vanishing moduli mediated

1/2 approximately around
the TeV-scale), c is roughly of order c(cid:48) × 10−3. Depending on the exact value of c(cid:48),
which is beyond the scope of this analysis, we can achieve competing contributions
from moduli mediation and anomaly mediation.

3.3.3 Moduli Redeﬁnitions

Desequestering can also potentially occur due to moduli redeﬁnitions which might
be necessary order by order in perturbation theory. This desequestering eﬀect can
for example arise due to a shift of the local cycle τSM → τSM + α lnV which has the
eﬀect of making the soft-terms of the same order as the gravitino mass [183, 184].

Such moduli redeﬁnitions depend on the structure of the D-branes conﬁguration.
In particular, it has been argued that redeﬁnitions are absent for conﬁgurations in-
volving only D3-branes at orbifold singularities but are present for D3-branes at
orientifold singularities and in cases with both D3- and D7-branes (see [183]).

We emphasize that desequestering occurs only if the moduli redeﬁnition leads
to a change in the functional form of the Kähler potential. Arguments suggesting a
change in the functional form were presented in [183] but an explicit computation

132

of such a change is still not available in the literature. Some recent explicit compu-
tations of the Kähler potential [272, 273] have shown that perturbative corrections
can be such that, along with a ﬁeld redeﬁnition, there is also an additional term
generated in the Kähler potential. In these cases, however, the two eﬀects conspire
to leave the functional form of the Kähler potential invariant. More detailed studies
of perturbative corrections to the Kähler potential are crucial to get a comprehensive
understanding of the relationship between moduli redeﬁnitions and desequestering.

3.3.4 Superpotential Desequestering

Apart from potentially destroying the hierarchy between soft masses and m3/2, var-
ious sub-leading eﬀects can have important phenomenological consequences. Inter-
esting constraints arise from non-perturbative terms in the superpotential involving
visible sector ﬁelds [196]. Superpotential terms of the type

ˆW =

ˆµHuHd + ˆλu

ijQiujHu + ˆλd

(3.97)

would lead to ﬂavour violation and CP-violation via A-terms with a strength sen-
3/2/V n the
sitive to the hierarchy between soft masses and m3/2. For M 2
strength of CP and ﬂavour violation induced by A-terms would be

(3.98)

with v equal to the higgs VEV. CP violation and FCNC bounds then require V <
105. This gives a slight tension with our results but there can be several ways
around this issue. The estimate (3.98) is based on eﬀective ﬁeld theory arguments;
it assumes generic order one coeﬃcients for the superpotential terms in (3.97). A
string computation of the coeﬃcients was done in [198]. This indicates that the
coeﬃcients are suppressed unless the Standard Model cycle and the cycle on which
the instanton is supported share a homologous two-cycle. The presence of ﬂavour
symmetries [179, 191, 274, 275] in the visible sector can also alleviate this tension.

3.4 Conclusions

In this chapter we have analyzed soft-terms for LVS sequestered models with dS
moduli stabilization. These models are particularly attractive for phenomenological
reasons: the string scale is around the GUT scale, soft masses are at the TeV scale
and the lightest modulus is much heavier than the bound imposed by the CMP. The

133

volume of the compactiﬁcation is of order V ∼ 107 in string units and the visible
sector can be localized on D3-branes at a singularity.

The pattern of soft-terms for these models has been previously studied in [182].
In this chapter we have deepened the analysis of [182] by studying the eﬀect on
soft-terms of the sector responsible to realize a dS vacuum, and by classifying in
a systematic way any possible correction to the leading no-scale structure of soft-
terms. In particular, given that soft-terms depend on the moduli-dependence of the
Kähler metric for matter ﬁelds ˜Kα, we deﬁned two possible limits for ˜Kα: Local
scenarios where ˜Kα is such that the visible sector Yukawa couplings Yαβγ do not
depend on V only at leading order in an inverse volume expansion, and Ultra-local
scenarios where Yαβγ are exactly independent on V at all orders.14 Moreover, due to
the present lack of explicit string computations of ˜Kα, we parametrized its depen-
dence on the dilaton and complex structure moduli as an unknown function fα(U, S).

The computation of soft-terms has produced a wide range of phenomenological
possibilities depending on the exact moduli-dependence of the matter Kähler metric
and the way to achieve a dS vacuum. We considered two dS realizations based on
supersymmetric eﬀective actions: dS case 1 where hidden sector matter ﬁelds living
on a bulk cycle develop non-vanishing F-terms because of D-terms ﬁxing, and dS
case 2 where the blow-up mode of a singularity diﬀerent from the visible sector one
develops non-zero F-terms due to non-perturbative eﬀects. Broadly speaking, we
found two classes of models:

√

1. Split-SUSY : Local models and ultra-local models in the dS case 1 yield gaug-
ino masses and A-terms which are suppressed with respect to scalar masses:
 (cid:28) m3/2 for  ∼ m3/2/MP (cid:28) 1. For volumes of
M1/2 ∼ m3/2 (cid:28) m0 ∼ m3/2
order of 107 in string units these models provide a version of the Split-SUSY
scenario with a ‘largish’ splitting between gauginos and scalars (according to
current experimental bounds). Non-universalities are present but suppressed
by inverse powers of the volume.

2. Standard MSSM : For ultra-local models in the dS case 2, all soft-terms are
of the same order: M1/2 ∼ m0 ∼ m3/2 (cid:28) m3/2. Therefore these models
include the CMSSM parameter space and its possible generalizations since each
soft-term comes along with a tunable ﬂux-dependent coeﬃcient. Moreover,
depending on the exact functional dependence of the Kähler metric for matter
14Evidence in favor of ultralocality has been obtained from explicit string computations in

toroidal orbifolds [197]. The case of realistic CY compactiﬁcations remains to be explored.

134

ﬁelds, these models can also feature non-universalities which are constrained
by the experimental bounds on ﬂavour changing neutral currents.

Let us stress again that the exact numerical coeﬃcients of the soft-terms are
functions of the dilaton and complex structure moduli which are ﬁxed in terms of
ﬂux quanta. Hence soft-terms vary as one scans through the string landscape. This
crucial property of our scenarios gives supersymmetric models the freedom to per-
form any tuning which is needed for phenomenological reasons. In particular, it is
low-energy SUSY that addresses the hierarchy problem by stabilizing the higgs mass
at the weak scale, while scanning through the landscape provides small variations
in the size of soft-terms as necessary to reproduce all the detailed features of exper-
imental data. This tuning at low energies can be viewed as a choice of parameters
in the high scale theory. There is a large freedom of choice in the high scale theory
which is however not arbitrary since this freedom is provided by the theory itself
(by having a computable landscape of vacua).

√

Note that in the ultra-local case the two ways to achieve a dS vacuum give rise
to a diﬀerent pattern of soft-terms. This can intuitively be understood as follows:
the depth of the LVS AdS vacuum is of order m2
3/2, and so any extra term which
yields a dS solution has to be of this order of magnitude. In turn, if the ﬁeld φ
responsible for dS uplifting is not decoupled from the visible sector, scalar masses
 are expected to arise because of this new contribution to the scalar
of order m3/2
potential. This is actually what happens in the dS case 1 since φ lives on a bulk
cycle, and so it is not decoupled from the visible sector. On the other hand, in
the dS case 2 φ lives on a singularity which is geometrically separated from the one
supporting the visible sector. This gives rise to an eﬀective decoupling between φ
and the visible sector, resulting in suppressed scalar masses.

We would also like to emphasize that our analysis for the dS case 1, together
with [206] (which provided visible sector models embedded in moduli stabilized com-
pact CYs), provides a very comprehensive study of SUSY-breaking in string theory.

The soft-terms which are more complicated to estimate are the ˆµ and B ˆµ-terms
since they receive contributions from both the Kähler potential and the superpoten-
tial. Moreover, these contributions could generically be forbidden in models with
branes at singularities because of the presence of anomalous U (1) symmetries. In
this case, eﬀective ˆµ and B ˆµ-terms could still be generated due to non-perturbative
corrections (e.g. D-branes instantons) or matter ﬁelds which develop non-vanishing

135

VEVs. However in this last case, besides the need to go beyond the MSSM by includ-
ing additional matter ﬁelds, any prediction for ˆµ and B ˆµ-terms would necessarily
be model-dependent.

Non-Thermal Dark Matter

4.1 Motivation for Non-thermal Dark Matter

One of the main particle physics candidates for DM is a stable neutralino χ which
emerges as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in several scenarios beyond
the Standard Model. The DM relic abundance is generically assumed to be pro-
duced thermally by the following process: the LSP is in a thermal bath in the early
universe, subsequently drops out of thermal equilibrium and freezes-out at temper-
atures of order Tf (cid:39) mDM/20 when DM annihilation becomes ineﬃcient.

However, we have no direct observational evidence of the history of the universe
before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) for temperatures above TBBN (cid:39) 3 MeV.
There is therefore no reason to assume a very simple cosmological history charac-
terized by just a single period of radiation dominance from the end of inﬂation until
BBN. In fact, the presence of a period of matter domination between the end of
inﬂation and BBN could completely change the ﬁnal prediction for the DM relic
density if the reheating temperature at the end of this period of matter dominance
is below Tf [276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281].

This non-thermal picture emerges generically in UV theories like string theory
due to the ubiquitous presence of gravitationally coupled scalars [186, 187, 282, 283,
284, 285, 286]. During inﬂation these ﬁelds, called moduli, get a displacement from
their minimum that is in general of order MP [287]. After the end of inﬂation, when
the Hubble constant reaches their mass, H ∼ mmod, they start oscillating around
their minimum and store energy. Redshifting as matter, they quickly dominate the
energy density of the universe which gets reheated when the moduli decay. Being
only gravitationally coupled, the moduli tend to decay very late when H ∼ Γ ∼

(4.1)

has to be larger than TBBN in order to preserve the successful BBN predictions.1 This
requirement sets a lower bound on the moduli masses of order mmod (cid:38) 1.3 × 105
GeV [186, 187, 282].

Generically in string compactiﬁcations SUSY-breaking eﬀects develop a mass for
the moduli and generate by gravity or anomaly mediation soft-terms of order Msoft.
Due to their common origin, the mass of the lightest modulus mmod is therefore
related to the scale of the soft-terms as Msoft = κmmod. Given the cosmological
constraint mmod (cid:38) 1.3 × 105 GeV, only models with κ (cid:28) 1 can allow for low-
energy SUSY to solve the hierarchy problem. Values of κ ∼ O(10−2) can come
from loop suppression factors [189, 232, 235, 290] while much smaller values κ ∼
O(10−3 − 10−4) can arise due to sequestering eﬀects [1, 182]. For Msoft ∼ O(1) TeV,
the corresponding reheating temperature becomes

(cid:114) Msoft

MP

TR ∼ Msoft
κ3/2

∼ κ−3/2 O(10−2) MeV ,

(4.2)

which for 10−2 (cid:46) κ (cid:46) 10−4 is between O(10) MeV and O(10) GeV. This is below the
freeze-out temperature for LSP masses between O(100) GeV and O(1) TeV which
is Tf ∼ O(10 − 100) GeV. Therefore any DM relic density previously produced via
the standard thermal mechanism gets erased by the late-time decay of the lightest
modulus. In this new scenario, the LSP gets produced non-thermally from the mod-
ulus decay.

From a bottom-up perspective, non-thermal cosmological histories can also en-
large the available parameter space of diﬀerent DM models consistent with direct
and indirect detection experiments, due to the presence of the additional parameter
TR. This is appealing as it is very hard to reproduce a correct thermal relic density
in the CMSSM/mSUGRA (see for instance [291]) since a bino-like LSP tends to
overproduce DM (apart from some ﬁne-tuned cases like stau co-annihilation and
A-funnel or in the case of precision gauge coupling uniﬁcation [226]) while for a
higgsino- or wino-like LSP the relic density is in general under-abundant (except for

1Trh has also to be lower than the temperature above which the internal space decompacti-

ﬁes [288, 289].

140

cases like well tempered bino/higgsino or bino/wino DM [292]).

The purpose of this chapter is to study the production of Non-Thermal DM
in the CMMS, where the free parameters are:
the standard parameters of the
CMSSM/mSUGRA [293, 294, 295, 296], i.e. the universal scalar mass m, univer-
sal gaugino mass M and trilinear coupling A deﬁned at the GUT scale, tan β and
the sign of µ, with in addition the reheating temperature TR from the decay of the
lightest modulus. We shall follow the RG running of these parameters from the
GUT to the electroweak (EW) scale and require a higgs mass mh (cid:39) 125 GeV,
a correct radiative EW symmetry breaking (REWSB) and no DM non-thermal
overproduction. We shall then focus on the points satisfying all these require-
ments and we will impose on them several phenomenological constraints coming
from LEP [297, 298, 299, 300], LHC [301, 302, 303, 304, 305], Planck [49], Fermi
(pass 8 limit) [306], XENON100 [307], CDMS [308], IceCube [309] and LUX [310].
Moreover we shall focus only on cases where the LSP has a non-negligible higgsino
component since bino-like DM requires a very low reheating temperature which is
strongly disfavored by dark radiation bounds in the context of many string mod-
els [311]. Interestingly we shall ﬁnd that the constraints from Fermi and LUX are
very severe and do not rule out the entire non-thermal CMSSM parameter space
only for reheating temperatures TR (cid:38) O(1) GeV. The best case scenario is real-
ized for TR = 2 GeV where a higgsino-like LSP with a mass around 300 GeV can
saturate the observed DM relic abundance. For larger reheating temperatures the
LSP bino component has to increase, resulting in strong direct detection bounds
which allow only for cases with DM underproduction. Values of TR above 1 GeV
require values of κ ∼ O(10−3 − 10−4) which can be realized only in models where
the CMSSM is sequestered from the sources of SUSY-breaking [1, 182]. In these
models the contribution to gaugino masses from anomaly mediation turns out to
be negligibly small and hence is distinct from other scenarios [189, 232, 235, 290]
where contributions from anomaly mediation are signiﬁcant and where a wino LSP
can be realized. Apart from DM, these models are very promising since they can
be embedded in globally consistent CY compactiﬁcations [181, 206, 236], allow for
TeV-scale SUSY and successful inﬂationary models [312, 313, 314], do not feature
any CMP,2 are compatible with gauge coupling uniﬁcation and do not suﬀer from
any moduli-induced gravitino problem [316, 317]. Non-standard thermal history us-
ing CMSSM was considered in ref. [318] where the entropy due to the decay of the
inﬂaton reduces the thermal relic abundance. In this thesis, however, we consider

2Ref. [315] provides a signiﬁcant bound on moduli masses and the number of e-foldings during

inﬂation which can be a challenge for many models.

141

that the DM particles from the moduli decay constitute the DM abundance and the
thermal DM abundance contribution to the net DM content is negligible since Tr is
not required to be very close to Tf.

In Sec. 4.2 we discuss CMSSM soft-terms, in Sec. 4.3 we analyze the non-thermal

CMSSM, in Sec. 4.4 we discuss our results.

4.2 CMSSM Soft-Terms

In a UV completion of the MSSM like string theory, SUSY is spontaneously broken
by some dynamical mechanism which generates particular relations between the soft-
terms via gravity, anomaly or gauge mediation. In the case when the soft-terms are
universal at the GUT scale, they are given by the scalar mass m, the gaugino mass
M, the trilinear coupling A and the bilinear higgs mixing B. We can generically
parametrize these soft-terms and the µ parameter at the GUT scale as:

m = a |M| , A = b M , B = c M , µ = d M ,

(4.3)

where, in a stringy embedding, the coeﬃcients a, b, c and d are functions of the un-
derlying parameters while the gaugino mass M sets the overall scale of the soft-terms
in terms of the gravitino mass m3/2. In order to perform a phenomenological analysis
of this scenario one has to follow the renormalization group (RG) evolution of these
soft-terms from the GUT to the EW scale and impose the following constraints: a
correct REWSB, a higgs mass of order mh (cid:39) 125 GeV, no DM overproduction and
no contradiction with ﬂavour observables and with any experimental result in either
particle physics or cosmology.

A viable REWSB can be obtained if at the EW scale the following two relations

are satisﬁed:

Given that the requirement of a correct REWSB ﬁxes only the magnitude of µ
leaving its sign as free, the parameters (4.3) are typically traded for the standard

(4.6)

where one runs m, M and A (or a, b and M in our case) from the GUT to the EW
scale with a particular choice of tan β and sign(µ). eq. (4.4) and (4.5) then give
the value of B and µ at the EW scale. This is the way in which typical spectrum
generators operate.3 The boundary values of B and µ at the GUT scale which give
a correct REWSB can be obtained by running back B and µ from the EW to the
GUT scale. In this way we obtain the values of the coeﬃcients c and d. In a viable
UV model, these values of c and d have to be compatible with the values allowed
by the stringy dynamics responsible for SUSY-breaking and the generation of soft-
terms. The expressions in eq. (4.4) and (4.5) are tree level relations. We use loop
corrections to these relations in our calculations.

4.3 Non-thermal CMSSM

As motivated in Sec. 4.1, we shall consider scenarios where the LSP is produced
non-thermally like in the case of string compactiﬁcations where the reheating tem-
perature TR from the decay of the lightest modulus is generically below the thermal
freeze-out temperature [283, 284, 285, 286]. This reheating temperature represents
an additional parameter which has to be supplemented to the standard free param-
eters of the CMSSM (a, b, M, tan β and the sign of µ). We call this new scenario
the ‘non-thermal CMSSM’ which is characterized by the following free parameters:
TR, a, b, the gaugino mass M, tan β and the sign of µ.

4.3.1 Non-thermal Dark Matter Relic Density

BrDM denotes the branching ratio for modulus decays into R-parity odd particles
which subsequently decay to DM.

The expression in eq. (4.7) leads to two scenarios for non-thermal DM:

1. ‘Annihilation scenario’:

in this case the DM abundance is given by the ﬁrst
term on the right-hand side of eq. (4.7) and the DM particles undergo some
annihilation after their initial production by modulus decay. In order to avoid
DM overabundance one needs

(cid:115)

(4.10)

Given that TR < Tf and g∗(TR) < g∗(Tf ), this scenario requires (cid:104)σannv(cid:105)f >
(cid:104)σannv(cid:105)Th
f as in the case of thermal underproduction. This condition is satis-
ﬁed by a higgsino- or wino-like LSP but not by a pure bino-like LSP which
would generically lead to non-thermal overproduction (apart from the afore-
mentioned cases). However, given that we shall focus on models with just
gravity mediated SUSY-breaking (contributions from anomaly mediation are
sub-leading) and universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale as in [1, 182],
the LSP can never be wino-like due to the RG running of the gauginos. Bino
is the lightest gaugino. Moreover a wino-like LSP has a signiﬁcantly larger
annihilation cross section than a higgsino-like LSP resulting in a strong con-
ﬂict with Fermi bounds for sub-TeV wino-like DM [321]. In this context, the
‘Annihilation scenario’ requires a higgsino-like DM. Let us ﬁnally point out
that the non-thermal DM relic density can be written in terms of the thermal
one as:

ΩNT

DMh2 =

(4.11)

(cid:18) Tf

(cid:19)

TR

(cid:115)

where NT stands for Non-Thermal, while T means Thermal. For 5 GeV <
Tf < 80 GeV (corresponding to 100 GeV < mDM < 1.6 TeV), the top, the
higgs, the Z and the W± are not relativistic, giving g∗(Tf ) = 86.25 and:

(4.12)

2. ‘Branching scenario’: in this case the DM abundance is given by the second
term on the right-hand side of eq. (4.7) and the DM particles are produced
directly from the modulus decay since their residual annihilation is ineﬃcient.
In this case both large and small cross sections can satisfy the DM content since
the annihilation cross section does not have any impact on the DM content.
This scenario is very eﬀective to understand the DM and baryon abundance
coincidence problem [322]. Given that in general we have BrDM (cid:38) 10−3 4, in
order not to overproduce DM for LSP masses of order hundreds of GeV, one
needs Ymod (cid:46) 10−9. This condition requires a very low reheating temperature:

TR (cid:46) 10−9mmod = 10−9κ−1Msoft .

(4.13)

For Msoft ∼ O(1) TeV and κ ∼ O(10−2 − 10−4) we ﬁnd TR (cid:46) O(10) MeV.
In order to obtain such a low reheating temperature one has in general to
consider models where the modulus coupling to visible sector ﬁelds is loop
suppressed [286]. However in this case it is very challenging to avoid a large
modulus branching ratio into hidden sector light ﬁelds like stringy axions [4,
323, 324] and so typically dark radiation is overproduced [311]. Therefore the
‘Branching scenario’ does not seem very promising from the phenomenological
point of view.

4.3.2 Collider and CMB Constraints

Due to the considerations mentioned above, if the LSP is bino-like we generically
get DM overproduction also in the non-thermal case. The CMSSM boundary con-
dition requires bino to be the lightest among the gauginos. We shall therefore look
for particular regions in the non-thermal CMSSM parameter space where the LSP
has a non-negligible higgsino component. We have developed a Monte Carlo pro-
gramme to ﬁnd the regions of this parameter space where the LSP is higgsino-like,
4In this case, the dominant decay mode of moduli is gauge Bosons, φ → gg. However the

gauginos appear in three body ﬁnal state, i.e., φ → g ˜g˜g with BrDM (cid:38) 10−3 [322].

the higgs mass is around 125.5 GeV,5 REWSB takes place correctly and the following
phenomenological constraints are satisﬁed:

• LEP [297, 298, 299, 300] and LHC [301, 302, 303, 304, 305] constraints on

neutralino and chargino direct production: mDM (cid:38) 100 GeV;

• LHC [301, 302, 303, 304, 305] bounds on gluino and squark masses: m˜g (cid:38) 1300

GeV;

• LHC constraints from ﬂavour physics: BR(Bs → µ+µ−) [325] and the con-

straint on BR(b → sγ) [5];

• Planck data on DM relic density [49].

To avoid complications with the applicability of the standard Spheno version, we
restrict our scan on the following parameter ranges: tan β = 1 to 55, a = 0 to 10,
b = −5 to 5, and the universal gaugino mass at the high scale M = 0.3 − 3 TeV.
The results are shown in Figs. 4.1-4.3 for positive µ (the LSP relic density has been
calculated using micrOMEGAS v3 [326]).

The plots in Fig. 4.1 show the points surviving the above constraints in the A/M-
m/M plane (at the GUT scale). The points ﬁt into a V-shaped band illustrating

5Both ATLAS and CMS give values of the higgs mass between 125 and 126 GeV. In what
follows, we will consider ranges of values in this region, allowing to some extent for the uncertainty
in the spectrum generators as well. Allowing for a larger uncertainty in the higgs mass does not
alter the following results qualitatively.

a slight hierarchy between scalar and gaugino masses (m (cid:38) 5M) and values of A
almost symmetric around A (cid:39) M. The regions shown in the plot are mostly for TR
rather smaller than Tf which keeps mostly the focus point regions in the allowed
parameter space. The coannihilation and A-funnel regions can also contribute to
the allowed parameter space but they are very ﬁne tuned. The V-shape of our plots
is caused by the focus point region which can be obtained by setting µ ∼ mZ in
the EWSB condition with loop corrections. In fact, the dependence of µ2 on A, M
and m arises through m2
Hu which depends on the UV soft-terms in the following
way: M 2(f (Q) + g(Q)A/M + h(Q)(A/M )2 + e(Q)(m/M )2), where f, g, h and e
depend on dimensionless gauge and Yukawa couplings (e also includes the tadpole
correction from the stop loop) and Q is the SUSY-breaking scale [327]. A leading
order cancellation in this expression, as needed to achieve a small µ-term in eq.
(4.4), gives a V-shaped band in the A/M-m/M plane. We also apply the higgs
mass constraint in this parameter space which depends on the square of Xt ≡
At − µ cot β [328] and X 2
t preserves the V-shape due to its dependence on (A/M )2.
To illustrate the allowed parameter range and to illustrate diﬀerent aspects of

the surviving points, we show the following plots (for positive sign of µ):

1. In Fig. 4.1, the color codes illustrate the percentage of higgsino-like neutralino
on the left plot and the neutralino contribution to the thermal DM relic density
on the right. Note that in most of the points the neutralinos contribute only
a small percentage of the total DM relic density and other DM candidates,
such as axions, have to be present. The thermal DM relic density is close
to the observed Planck value only in a small region corresponding to an LSP

147

that is approximately 50% bino and 50% higgsino. However, as we will see in
the next section, after imposing indirect detection constraints from Fermi, the
only region which survives is the one where thermal DM is under-abundant (by
about 10% of the observed relic density). On the other hand, as we shall see in
the next section, non-thermal higgsino-like DM can lead to larger relic densities
which can saturate the Planck value for reheating temperatures around 2 - 3
GeV.

2. The color codes in Fig. 4.2 illustrate the dependence on tan β on the left
plot and diﬀerent values of gaugino masses on the right plot with well-deﬁned
domains for diﬀerent ranges of gaugino masses inside the V-shaped band. Note
that tan β tends to have larger values as expected from the ﬁt of mh and the
parameter ranges in this scan. Smaller values of A/M and m/M are preferred
for larger gaugino mass due to RG ﬂow of masses to ﬁt the experimental value
of mh.

3. For Fig. 4.3 the colors illustrate on the left the diﬀerent values of the typ-
ical scale of SUSY particles MSUSY, deﬁned here as the averaged stop mass
SUSY = m˜t1m˜t2. Notice that MSUSY is around 4 - 5 TeV. In principle, we
M 2
could explore values larger than 5 TeV however it would bring us beyond the
level of applicability of the spectrum generator SPheno we have been using
which assume similar values for all soft-terms. An analysis for a Split-SUSY-
like case with larger diﬀerences between sfermions and gaugino masses would
be required in that case but this goes beyond the scope of the analysis of
this chapter. The colors on the right plot illustrate the dependence on the
higgs mass for which we have taken mh = 125, 125.5, 126 GeV respectively.
Note that for mh = 126 GeV there are allowed points only on the left of the
V-shaped band because of the above mentioned cut-oﬀ on MSUSY. Generally
speaking we see that by allowing a larger range for the higgs mass, we widen
the V-shaped region.

4.3.3 Direct and Indirect Detection Constraints

In the ﬁgures above we have set µ > 0 but their pattern does not change for µ <
0. The next step is to impose the following phenomenological constraints for the
separate case of positive and negative µ since the DM direct detection cross section
depends on sign(µ):

1. Fermi bounds on DM indirect detection [306];

148

averaged stop mass MSUSY (left) and the higgs mass (right) in the region where the

2. IceCube [309] and XENON100 [307] bounds for spin-dependent DM direct

detection;

3. LUX [310], CDMS [308] bounds on spin-independent DM direct detection.
• Results for positive µ.

If we impose the above constraints, indirect detection bounds turn out to be
very severe. Using the new Fermi bounds (pass 8 limit) coming from data
collected until 2014 (the pass 7 limit includes only data until 2012), we do not
ﬁnd any allowed point for TR (cid:46) 2 GeV.
In Fig. 4.4 we show the results for diﬀerent reheating temperatures. The red
points show the parameter space where we saturate the DM content measured
from Planck [49]. We ﬁnd more allowed points for TR = 10 GeV compared
to TR = 2 GeV since the ratio of Tf /TR becomes smaller for large TR, and
so a smaller annihilation cross section is needed, resulting in a better chance
to satisfy the bounds from Fermi. We only see the large higgsino dominated
regions for smaller TR since in this case a larger annihilation cross section is
needed to saturate the DM content. For larger TR, an LSP with a smaller
higgsino component becomes allowed (higher bino component) and this re-
gion appears for smaller values of gaugino mass. We ﬁnally mention that the
Planck constraints on indirect detection through DM annihilation during the
recombination epoch are less stringent than those of Fermi for our scenarios.

GeV. IceCube bounds rule out the orange and red regions of the right-hand
side plot of Fig. 4.5.
Fig. 4.6 shows the inclusion of LUX bounds on the spin-independent direct
detection constraints which rule out most of the points in Fig. 4.5 apart from
a region corresponding to LSP masses around 300 GeV which is at the border
of detectability.
Moreover, for TR = 2 GeV there are red points which saturate the observed
DM content. In this case the neutralinos are becoming more pure higgsinos
in order to enhance the annihilation cross section and the Fermi constraint
becomes harder to avoid but there are still regions allowed by both direct and
indirect detection searches. There are more green points for TR = 10 GeV
since the annihilation cross section becomes smaller due to bino mixing which
means a larger allowed region after using Fermi data but the constraint from
the direct detection becomes more stringent (due to bino-higgsino mixing in
the LSP) and so there are no red points which saturate the observed DM
content.6 For the points shown in Fig. 4.6, the GUT values c = B/M and
d = µ/M are around 0.6 and 1 respectively.

6The direct detection exclusion however depends on various uncertainties, e.g. strange quark

content of proton, form factor etc. [329].

• Results for negative µ.

The results for the negative µ case are shown in Figs. 4.7 and 4.8.
Note that under the same conditions the allowed parameter space for µ < 0 is
larger than the one for µ > 0. This can be understood as follows [330, 331]:

4.4 Discussion of Results

4.4.1 Analysis of the Allowed Parameter Space
We are now in a position to put all our results together and explain the eﬀect
of each experimental bound on our parameter space. In the end we shall analyze
the spectrum of superpartners that appears for the points surviving all the phe-
nomenological constraints. All the observables analyzed in this section have been
computed numerically using micrOMEGAS v3 [326] linked to SPheno v3.3.3 [319, 320].

Fig. 4.9 shows the relation between the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross
section and the LSP mass. Depending on TR there is a diﬀerent upper bound for
neutralino masses which is given by the Planck constraint on DM. For larger values
of TR, the non-thermal relic density decreases, and so heavier neutralinos can pass
the Planck constraint on the DM relic density. On the other hand, for larger TR the
parameter space for standard thermal DM (orange band) becomes also larger. Note
that LUX 2013 results exclude at 90% most of the parameter space and the next
round of results (LUX 300 days) will be able to probe the remaining regions (the
light blue points below the LUX line).

In the scenario we considered, the gaugino masses are uniﬁed at the GUT scale
and therefore the evolution of electroweakinos is totally dominated by the RG ﬂow.
This implies that the LSP can only be higgsino- or bino-like (or a mixed combination

154

of them). The largest contributions to the thermal averaged annihilation rates are
given by (see for example [292] and references therein):

for bino-like LSP annihilation into fermion-antifermion (T3f and Qf are the third
component of isospin and the fermion charge and r = M 2
). This process is
1 /m2
˜f
driven at tree level by the t-channel exchange of a slepton ˜f. In the case where the
LSP is a mixed composition of higgsino and bino, the expression of the annihilation
rate is an interpolation between (4.16) and (4.17). Fig. 4.9 shows also the eﬀect of
Fermi bounds. As suggested by Fig. (4.16)) and Fig. (4.17), the most constrained
regions are those with smaller LSP masses. The grey band corresponds to points
excluded by LEP bounds on chargino direct production.

Fig. 4.10 shows the amount of non-thermal DM relic density provided by the
LSP in terms of its mass, together with the bounds from indirect detection and
LUX. The Planck value of the DM content can be saturated in the region which is
not ruled out by direct detection bounds only for TR = 2 GeV. Given that for larger
TR the amount of LSP DM gets smaller, the cases with TR > 2 GeV require multi-
component DM. Combining Fig. 4.9 and Fig. 4.10, we ﬁnd that the LUX allowed
regions, indirect detection limits and the abundance of LSP DM are correlated for
diﬀerent TR. The allowed regions, where the observed DM content is saturated,
depend on TR but they are generically around mDM (cid:39) 300 GeV.

In Fig. 4.11, we show the Planck constraints on indirect detection through DM
annihilation during the recombination epoch. We use W W ﬁnal states correspond-
ing to an eﬃciency factor feﬀ = 0.2 [332]. Even going all the way to the cosmic
variance bound, these constraints turn out to be less stringent than those coming
from Fermi and LUX. On the other hand, Fig. 4.11 shows the correlation between
the LSP composition and the bounds coming from both direct and indirect detec-
tion. Concerning Fermi and Planck limits on DM annihilation, these bounds allow
almost all possible combinations of bino/higgsino neutralinos. The restrictions com-

ing from the f f and W W channels depend on the neutralino composition:
for a
higgsino-like LSP, the most stringent constraint is due to annihilation into vector
bosons, while for a bino-like LSP the main constraint comes from annihilation into
a fermion-antifermion pair.

The LUX constraints in Fig. 4.11 reduce the parameter space to the region where
the LSP is mostly higgsino-like. This could be a bit puzzling since the WIMP-
nucleon cross section is dominated by the higgs exchange channel:

σχ−p ∝ a2

˜H

(g(cid:48)a ˜B − g a ˜W )2

m4
h

,

(4.18)

where a ˜H, a ˜B and a ˜W are respectively the higgsino, bino and wino LSP components.
According to this expression, the cross section is enhanced when the higgsino com-
ponent increases. However in Fig. 4.11 direct detection bounds allow only points
which are mainly higgsino-like. The reason of this eﬀect is in the eﬀective coupling
˜χ ˜χh which for a bino-like LSP looks like:

C ˜χ ˜χh (cid:39) mZ sin θW tan θW

1 − µ2
M 2

(M1 + µ sin 2β) ,

(4.19)

where for moderate to large tan β the second term is negligible and µ > M1. Hence
this coupling is dominated by M1. On the other hand, the coupling for a higgsino-like
LSP is:

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

,

(4.20)

C ˜χ ˜χh (cid:39) 1
2

(1 ± sin 2β)

mZ cos θ
M1 − |µ| +

mZ cos θ
M2 − |µ|

where ± is for the Hu and Hd components and µ < M1. Contrary to the bino-
like case, this coupling is inversely proportional to M1. Thus the WIMP-nucleon
cross section grows in the regions where the LSP is higgsino-like and M1 is small or
where the LSP is bino-like and the gaugino mass is large. If we compare Fig. 4.2
(right) which shows the distribution of gaugino masses along the V-shaped band,
with Fig. 4.4 (right) and 4.7 (right), we realize that the region with a smaller cross
section is the one at the bottom of the V-shaped band where gaugino masses are big
and the LSP is very higgsino-like. The region where the LSP is more bino-like has
smaller gaugino masses and the cross section is larger. Fermi constraints however
become more stringent in the case with more higgsino content due to larger annihi-
lation cross section. The competition between LUX and Fermi constraints produces
the allowed parameter space where the Planck value of the DM content is saturated

158

for TR = 2 GeV.

Finally, in Fig. 4.11 there is a change of behavior of the thermal averaged cross
section for masses around 130 GeV. The reason is the following: this region is (as
can be shown in the plot) higgsino-like, but the masses are closer to MW and (cid:104)σv(cid:105)
is no longer described by (4.16) but by something like (with x = µ/mW ):

(4.21)

In Fig. 4.12, we show the spectra of SUSY particles for the allowed regions of Fig. 4.6
(blue points below the LUX line). We ﬁnd that sleptons, staus, higgses, all other
scalar masses and gluinos are rather heavy since they are between about 2 and 7 TeV.
The lightest and second to lightest neutralino and the lightest chargino are around
280-340 GeV while all other neutralinos and charginos are heavy. The allowed region
for TR = 2 GeV is shown on the left side of the vertical line with the label TR = 2
GeV where the points situated exactly on the line satisfy all the constraints including
the current DM content as measured by Planck. Similarly, the allowed region for
TR ≥ 5 GeV is shown on the left side of the vertical line with the label TR ≥ 5 GeV
even if there are no points in this region which saturate the current DM content.
Notice that the spectrum is essentially independent of the reheating temperature
TR and the hierarchy between the diﬀerent sparticles is robust.

4.4.2 Astrophysical Uncertainties

The direct detection cross section can involve various uncertainties, e.g. strange
quark content of proton, form factor, local DM density and LSP contribution to
the total amount of observed DM abundance. The local density can be 0.1-0.7
GeV/cm3 [333]. There could also be astrophysical uncertainties in the indirect de-
tection results beyond what has been considered so far. Recently, it is mentioned
in [334, 335] that if the thermal neutralinos do not produce the entire amount of cold
DM, the direct and indirect detection cross sections should be reduced by R and
R2 respectively with R ≡ Ωh2/0.12. Possible bounds arising from Fermi are now
almost negligible since they are suppressed by R2. Once the suppression factor R
is taken into account, Fermi, Planck and other indirect detection experiments have
lower impacts. Concerning the eﬀect on LUX and other direct detection bounds,
the cross section is now reduced by R which is equivalent to multiplying the eﬀec-
√
R. This clearly introduces a new
tive couplings in eq. (4.19) and eq. (4.20) by
parameter in the discussion performed in the previous section.

If we assume such a reduction in the cases where ΩNT

space could be allowed for multi-component DM regions as shown in Fig. 4.13.
The pink region is disallowed by Fermi data. The TR dependence of the region

R becomes larger for smaller values of TR (=2 GeV) and the Fermi constraint be-
comes important. The region below the dashed line satisﬁed present LUX limits. In
particular this implies that the region with lighter neutralinos is now unconstrained
by LUX. This region typically corresponds to more bino component in the LSP as
shown in Fig. 4.4 (right) and 4.7 (right). We have therefore a diﬀerent situation
compared to before, because now neutralinos with a larger bino component are al-
lowed.

Let us stress, however, that the prediction for the region where ΩNT

DMh2 saturates
the DM content remains unchanged, i.e. only the case TR = 2 GeV contains points
which are still allowed by all data and saturate the DM content with an LSP mass
around 300 GeV. This new factor R helps us to extract more parameter space for
the multi-component DM scenarios. However, the DM simulations need to establish
the validity of the assumption that proportions of various DM components in the

4.5 Conclusions

Non-thermal DM scenarios emerge in UV theories like string theory due to the
presence of gravitationally coupled scalars which decay at late times when they are
dominating the energy density of the universe. In such models the reheating temper-
ature due to moduli decays is typically below the freeze-out temperature, TR < Tf
when assuming an MSSM particle as main DM constituent.

In this chapter we have studied the non-thermal version of the CMSSM/mSUGRA
and contrasted it with both particle physics and astrophysical experimental con-
straints. The experimental information available at this moment, including the well
known value of the higgs mass, is enough to rule out the vast majority of the non-
thermal CMSSM parameter space. There is still a small region which is consistent
with all observations and is at the edge of detection by both astrophysics and parti-
cle physics experiments, resulting in a very interesting situation for beyond the SM
physics.

In our determination of the allowed parameter space we have used constraints
from collider experiments (LEP, LHC), cosmic microwave background observations
(Planck) and direct and indirect DM searches (Fermi, XENON100, IceCube, LUX,
CDMS). We have found that the most restrictive constraints come from Fermi and

162

LUX which single out a small region of the non-thermal CMSSM parameter space
corresponding to a higgsino-like LSP with a mass around 300 GeV that can saturate
the observed DM abundance for TR (cid:39) 2 GeV while larger reheating temperatures
require additional contributions to the present DM abundance. These results are
summarized in Fig. 4.10 which shows the comparison between the cases of positive
and negative µ.

This non-thermal scenario leads to a clear pattern of SUSY particles. In partic-
ular, the fact that the LSP is higgsino-like makes the lightest chargino, the lightest
neutralino and next to lightest neutralino to be almost degenerate in mass. This
kind of scenario can be probed at the LHC using monojet plus soft leptons plus
missing energy [336, 337], monojet signal [338] and two Vector Boson Fusion jets
and large missing transverse energy [338]. On the other hand, all the other super-
partners are much heavier and beyond the LHC reach but accessible to potential
future experiments such as a 100 TeV machine.

It is worth mentioning that non-thermal CMSSM scenarios with TeV-scale soft-
terms and reheating temperatures around 1 - 10 GeV can emerge in string models
where the visible sector is sequestered from the sources of SUSY-breaking [1, 182].
In a subset of the parameter range these string scenarios lead to Msoft ∼ MP2 (cid:28)
mmod ∼ MP3/2 (cid:28) MGUT ∼ MP1/3 and TR ∼ MP9/4 where  (cid:39) m3/2/MP (cid:28) 1. For
 ∼ 10−8, one obtains TeV-scale soft-terms, MGUT ∼ 1016 GeV, TR ∼ 1 − 10 GeV
and mmod ∼ 106 GeV for m3/2 ∼ 1010 GeV.

We point out that our analysis is based on the CMSSM/mSUGRA for which all
superpartners are expected to be at similar masses close to the TeV scale. In this
sense we restricted ourselves to scalar masses lighter than 5 TeV which is the range
of validity of the codes we have used to perform our analysis.

There are several additional ways to generalize the analisys:
• Consider non-universal extensions of the CMSSM. Small departures from uni-
versality, even though strongly constrained by ﬂavour changing neutral cur-
rents, allow more ﬂexibility in the parameter space and will slightly enhance
the allowed region.

• Consider sfermions heavier than 5 TeV as in the split-SUSY case. This is not
only an interesting phenomenological possibility but is also the other class of
scenarios that were derived in the string compactiﬁcations studied in [1, 182].

163

• Consider MSSM scenarios with R-parity violation and late decaying moduli
ﬁelds. This class of models has not been studied in detail and given the fact
that even with R-parity conservation there seems to be a need for other sources
of DM such as axions or axinos, this should be a possibility worth studying.
• Consider explicit D-branes models which tend to generate models beyond the

standard MSSM (see for instance [191, 199, 274] for such models).

It is encouraging that new planned experiments such as upcoming LUX result
and XENON1T will be enough to rule out the rest of the allowed parameter space,
independent of the upcoming LHC run. Clearly also new LHC runs and future
planned colliders will be crucial for this class of models. Combining astrophysical
and collider measurements is probably the most eﬃcient way to constrain beyond
the SM physics and the analysis performed in this chapter is a clear illustration of
this strategy.

Dark Radiation in Sequestered
Models

5.1 Introduction

According to the cosmological Standard Model (SM), neutrinos were in thermal
equilibrium at early times and decoupled at temperatures of order 1 MeV. This de-
coupling left behind a cosmic neutrino background which has been emitted much
earlier than the analogous cosmic microwave background (CMB). Due to the weak-
ness of the weak interactions, this cosmic neutrino background cannot be detected
directly, and so goes under the name of ‘dark radiation’. Its contribution to the total
energy density ρtot is parametrized in terms of the eﬀective number of neutrino-like
species Neﬀ as:

.

(5.1)

The SM predictions for Neﬀ are Neﬀ = 3 during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)
and Neﬀ = 3.046 at CMB times since neutrinos get slightly reheated when electrons
and positrons annihilate. Any departure from these values would be a clear signal
of physics beyond the SM due to the presence of extra dark radiation controlled by
the parameter ∆Neﬀ ≡ Neﬀ − Neﬀ,SM.

Given that Neﬀ is positively correlated with the present value of the Hubble con-
stant H0, the comparison between indirect estimates of H0 from CMB experiments
and direct astrophysical measurements of H0 could signal the need for extra dark
radiation. The Planck 2013 value of the Hubble constant is H0 = (67.3±1.2) km s−1

165

Mpc−1 (68% CL) [30] which is in tension at 2.5σ with the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) value H0 = (73.8 ± 2.4) km s−1 Mpc−1 (68% CL) [339]. Hence the Planck
2013 estimate of Neﬀ with this HST ‘H0 prior’ is Neﬀ = 3.62+0.50−0.48 (95% CL) which
is more than 2σ away from the SM value and gives ∆Neﬀ ≤ 1.07 at 2σ.

However the HST Cepheid data have been reanalyzed by [340] who found the
diﬀerent value H0 = (70.6 ± 3.3) km s−1 Mpc−1 (68% CL) which is within 1σ of
the Planck 2015 estimate H0 = (67.3 ± 1.0) km s−1 Mpc−1 (68% CL) [49]. Hence
the Planck 2015 collaboration performed a new estimate of Neﬀ without using any
‘H0 prior’ and obtaining Neﬀ = 3.13 ± 0.32 (68% CL) [30] which is perfectly con-
sistent with the SM value and gives ∆Neﬀ ≤ 0.72 at around 2σ. This result might
seem to imply that extra dark radiation is ruled out but this naive interpretation
can be misleading since larger Neﬀ corresponds to larger H0 and there is still an
unresolved controversy in the direct measurement of H0. In fact the Planck 2015
paper [49] analyzes also the case with the prior ∆Neﬀ = 0.39 obtaining the result
H0 = (70.6 ± 1.0) km s−1 Mpc−1 (68% CL) which is even in better agreement with
the new HST estimate of H0 performed in [340]. Thus we stress that trustable direct
astrophysical measurements of H0 are crucial in order to obtain reliable bounds on
Neﬀ.

Neﬀ is also constrained by measurements of primordial light element abundances.
The Planck 2015 estimate of Neﬀ based on the helium primordial abundance and
combined with the measurements of [341] is Neﬀ = 3.11+0.59−0.57 (95% CL) giving
∆Neﬀ ≤ 0.65 at 2σ [49]. However measurements of light element abundances are
diﬃcult and often aﬀected by systematic errors, and so also in this case there is still
some controversy in the literature since [342] reported a larger helium abundance
that, in turn, leads to Neﬀ = 3.58 ± 0.50 (99% CL) which is 3σ away from the SM
value and gives ∆Neﬀ ≤ 1.03 at 3σ. Due to all these experimental considerations,
in the rest of this chapter we shall consider ∆Neﬀ (cid:46) 1 as a reference upper bound
for the presence of extra dark radiation.

Extra neutrino-like species can be produced in any beyond the SM theory which
features hidden sectors with new relativistic degrees of freedom (dof ). In particular,
extra dark radiation is naturally generated when reheating is driven by the decay
of a gauge singlet since in this case there is no a priori good reason to suppress the
branching ratio into hidden sector light particles [323, 324, 343].

166

This situation is reproduced in string models of the early universe due to the
presence of gravitationally coupled moduli which get displaced from their minimum
during inﬂation, start oscillating when the Hubble scale reaches their mass, quickly
come to dominate the energy density of the universe since they redshift as matter
and ﬁnally reheat the universe when they decay [283, 284, 285, 286]. In the presence
of many moduli, the crucial one is the lightest since its decay dilutes any previous
relic produced by the decay of heavier moduli.

Two important cosmological constraints have to be taken into account: (i) the
lightest modulus has to decay before BBN in order to preserve the successful BBN
predictions for the light element abundances [186, 187, 282]; (ii) the modulus decay to
gravitinos should be suppressed in order to avoid problems of DM overproduction be-
cause of gravitinos annihilation or modiﬁcations of BBN predictions [316, 317]. The
ﬁrst constraint sets a lower bound on the lightest modulus mass of order mmod (cid:38) 100
TeV, while a straightforward way to satisfy the second constraint is mmod < 2m3/2.

However in general in string compactiﬁcations the moduli develop a mass be-
cause of SUSY-breaking eﬀects which make the gravitino massive via the super
higgs mechanism and generate also soft-terms of order Msoft. Because of their com-
mon origin, one has therefore mmod ∼ m3/2 ∼ Msoft. The cosmological lower bound
mmod (cid:38) 100 TeV then pushes the soft-terms well above the TeV-scale ruining the
solution of the hierarchy problem based on low-energy SUSY. An intriguing way-out
is given by Type IIB string compactiﬁcations where the visible sector is constructed
via fractional D3-branes at singularities [99, 179, 206, 236]. In this case the blow-up
modulus resolving the singularity is ﬁxed at zero size in a supersymmetric manner,
resulting in the absence of local SUSY-breaking eﬀects. SUSY is instead broken by
bulk moduli far away from the visible sector singularity. Because of this geometric
separation, the visible sector is said to be ‘sequestered’ since the soft-terms can be
suppressed with respect to the gravitino mass by  = m3/2
MP

(cid:28) 1 [182].

A concrete example of sequestered SUSY-breaking is given by the Type IIB
LARGE Volume Scenario (LVS) with D3-branes at singularities, which is character-
ized by the following hierarchy of masses [182]:

M1/2 ∼ m3/2 (cid:28) mmod ∼ m3/2

√

 (cid:28) m3/2 .

(5.2)

This mass spectrum guarantees the absence of moduli decays to gravitinos and
allows for gaugino masses M1/2 around the TeV-scale for mmod ∼ 107 GeV and

167

m3/2 ∼ 1010 GeV. On the other hand, SUSY scalar masses m0 are more model-
dependent since their exact -dependence is determined by the form of the Kähler
metric for visible sector matter ﬁelds and the mechanism responsible for achieving
a dS vacuum. The general analysis of Chap. 3 [1] found two possible -scalings for
scalar masses: (i) m0 ∼ M1/2 corresponding to a typical MSSM-like scenario and
(ii) m0 ∼ mmod (cid:29) M1/2 resulting in a Split-SUSY-like case with heavy squarks and
sleptons.

Following the cosmological evolution of these scenarios, reheating takes place due
to the decay of the volume modulus which produces, together with visible sector par-
ticles, also hidden sector dof which could behave as extra dark radiation [323, 324].
Some hidden sector dof are model-dependent whereas others, like bulk closed string
axions, are always present, and so give a non-zero contribution to ∆Neﬀ. In fact, as
shown in [311], the production of axionic dark radiation is unavoidable in any string
model where reheating is driven by the moduli decay and some of the moduli are
stabilized by perturbative eﬀects which keep the corresponding axions light. Note
that light closed string axions can be removed from the low-energy spectrum via
the Stückelberg mechanism only for cycles collapsed to zero size since in the case of
cycles in the geometric regime the combination of axions eaten up by an anomalous
U (1) is mostly given by open string axions [311].

R-parity odd visible sector particles produced from the lightest modulus decay
subsequently decay to the lightest SUSY particle, which is one of the main DM
candidates. Due to their common origin, axionic dark radiation and neutralino DM
have an interesting correlation [311]. In fact, by combining present bounds on Neﬀ
with lower bounds on the reheating temperature Trh as a function of the DM mass
mDM from recent Fermi data, one can set interesting constraints on the (Neﬀ, mDM)-
plane. [311] found that standard thermal DM is allowed only if ∆Neﬀ → 0 while the
vast majority of the allowed parameter space requires non-thermal scenarios with
higgsino-like DM, in agreement with the results of [2] for the MSSM-like case.

Dark radiation production for the MSSM-like case has been studied in [323, 324]
which showed that the leading decay channels of the volume modulus are to visible
sector higgses via the Giudice-Masiero (GM) term and to ultra-light bulk closed
string axions. The simplest model with two higgs doublets and a shift-symmetric
higgs sector yields 1.53 (cid:46) ∆Neﬀ (cid:46) 1.60, where the window has been obtained by
varying the reheating temperature between 500 MeV and 5 GeV, which are typical

168

values for gravitationally coupled scalars with masses in the range mmod (cid:39) (1÷5)·107
GeV. These values of ∆Neﬀ lead to dark radiation overproduction since they are in
tension with current observational bounds.1 Possible way-outs to reduce ∆Neﬀ in-
volve models with either a larger GM coupling or more than two higgs doublets.

Due to this tension with dark radiation overproduction, diﬀerent models have
been studied in the literature. [345] showed how sequestered LVS models where the
CY volume is controlled by more than one divisor are ruled out since they predict
huge values of extra dark radiation of order ∆Neﬀ ∼ 104. On the other hand, [346]
focused on non-sequestered LVS models where the visible sector is realized via D7-
branes wrapping the large cycle controlling the CY volume.2 In this way, the decay
rate of the lightest modulus to visible sector gauge bosons becomes comparable to
the decay to bulk axions, and so the prediction for ∆Neﬀ can become smaller. In
fact, the simplest model with a shift-symmetric higgs sector yields ∆Neﬀ (cid:39) 0.5 [346].
However this case necessarily requires high-scale SUSY since without sequestering
Msoft ∼ m3/2 (up to loop factors), and so from (5.2) we see that the cosmological
P ∼
bound mmod ∼ m3/2
3× 109 GeV. Moreover in this case the visible sector gauge coupling is set by the CY
SM ∼ V 2/3 ∼ 25, and so it is hard to achieve large values of V without
volume V, α−1
introducing a severe ﬁne-tuning of some underlying parameters. A possible way-out
could be to consider anisotropic compactiﬁcations where the CY volume is controlled
by a large divisor and a small cycle which supports the visible sector [181, 347, 348].

 (cid:38) 100 TeV implies Msoft ∼ m3/2 (cid:38) (100 TeV)2/3 M 1/3

√

In this chapter we take instead a diﬀerent point of view and keep focusing
on sequestered models of Chap. 3 [323, 324], since they are particularly promis-
ing for phenomenological applications: they are compatible with TeV-scale SUSY
and gauge coupling uniﬁcation without suﬀering from any cosmological moduli and
gravitino problem, they can be embedded in globally consistent CY compactiﬁca-
tions [206, 236] and allow for successful inﬂationary models [312, 313, 314] and
neutralino non-thermal DM phenomenology [2]. Following the general analysis of
SUSY-breaking and its mediation to the visible sector performed in Chap. 3 [1] for
sequestered Type IIB LVS models with D3-branes at singularities, we focus on the
Split-SUSY case where squarks and sleptons acquire a mass of order the lightest
modulus mass: m0 = c mmod with c ∼ O(1). We compute the exact value of the
1Radiative corrections to the modulus coupling to higgs ﬁelds do not give rise to a signiﬁcant

change in the ﬁnal prediction for ∆Neﬀ [344].

2Another option involves ﬂavour D7-branes wrapped around the volume divisor and intersecting

the visible sector D3-branes localized at a singularity [346].

169

coeﬃcient c for diﬀerent Split-SUSY cases depending on the form of the Kähler met-
ric for visible sector matter ﬁelds and the mechanism responsible for achieving a dS
vacuum. We ﬁnd that the condition c ≤ 1/2, which allows the new decay channel to
SUSY scalars, can be satisﬁed only by including string loop corrections to the Kähler
potential [166, 168]. However this relation holds only at the string scale Ms ∼ 1015
GeV whereas the decay of the lightest modulus takes place at an energy of order
its mass mmod ∼ 107 GeV. Hence we consider the Renormalization Group (RG)
running of the SUSY scalar masses from Ms to mmod and then compare their value
to mmod whose running is in practice negligible since moduli have only gravitational
couplings. Given that also the RG running of SUSY scalar masses is a negligible
eﬀect in Split-SUSY-like models, we ﬁnd that radiative corrections do not alter the
parameter space region where the lightest modulus decay to SUSY scalars opens up.

We then compute the new predictions for ∆Neﬀ which gets considerably reduced
with respect to the MSSM-like case considered in [323, 324] since the branching ratio
to visible sector particles increases due to the new decay to squarks and sleptons and
the new contribution to the decay to higgses from their mass term. We ﬁnd that
the simplest model with a shift-symmetric higgs sector can suppress ∆Neﬀ to values
as small as 0.14 in perfect agreement with current experimental bounds. Depending
on the exact value of m0 all values in the range 0.14 (cid:46) ∆Neﬀ (cid:46) 1.6 are allowed.
Interestingly ∆Neﬀ can be within the allowed experimental window also in the case
of vanishing GM coupling Z = 0 since the main suppression of ∆Neﬀ comes from
the lightest modulus decay to squarks and sleptons. Given that a correct realization
of radiative EWSB in Split-SUSY-like models requires in general a large µ-term of
order m0, the lightest modulus branching ratio into visible sector dof is also slightly
increased due to its decay to higgsinos. However this new decay channel yields just
a negligible correction to the ﬁnal prediction for dark radiation production.

In Sec. 5.2 we analyze the predictions for axionic dark radiation. We present our

conclusions in Sec. 5.3. This chapter is based on [4].

5.2 Dark Radiation in Sequestered Models

As already argued in Sec. 5.1, the production of dark radiation is a generic feature
of string models where some of the moduli are ﬁxed by perturbative eﬀects [311]. In
fact, if perturbative corrections ﬁx the real part of the modulus T = τ +iψ, the axion
ψ remains exactly massless at this level of approximation due to its shift-symmetry,

170

leading to mτ (cid:29) mψ. Hence very light relativistic axions can be produced by the
decay of τ, giving rise to ∆Neﬀ (cid:54)= 0.

5.2.1 Dark Radiation from Moduli Decays

Following the cosmological evolution of the Universe, during inﬂation the canonically
normalized modulus Φ gets a displacement from its late-time minimum of order MP.
After the end of inﬂation the value of the Hubble parameter H decreases. When
H ∼ mΦ, Φ starts oscillating around its minimum and stores energy. During this
stage Φ redshifts as matter, so that it quickly comes to dominate the energy density
of the Universe. Afterwards reheating is caused by the decay of Φ which takes place
when:

This reheating temperature has to be larger than about 1 MeV in order to preserve
the successful BBN predictions.

In the presence of a non-zero branching ratio for Φ decays into hidden sector dof,
i.e. for chid (cid:54)= 0, extra axionic dark radiation gets produced, leading to [323, 324]:

where Tdec (cid:39) 1 MeV is the temperature of the Universe at neutrino decoupling with

g∗(Tdec) = 10.75. The factor in brackets is due to the fact that axions are very weakly
coupled (they are in practice only gravitationally coupled), and so they never reach
thermal equilibrium. Therefore, given that the comoving entropy density g∗(T )T 3a3
is conserved, the thermal bath gets slightly reheated when some species drop out
of thermal equilibrium. Note that the observational reference bound ∆Neﬀ (cid:46) 1
implies:

0.7 GeV while g∗(Trh) = 86.25 for Trh (cid:38) 0.7 GeV.

5.2.2 Light Relativistic Axions in LVS Models

Let us summarize the main reasons why axionic dark radiation production is a
typical feature of sequestered LVS models:

• Reheating is driven by the last modulus to decay which is τb since the moduli
mass spectrum takes the form (the axion ψSM is eaten up by an anomalous
U (1)):

m3/2, TeV-scale SUSY ﬁxes mτb around 107 GeV which in turn, using (5.6),
gives Trh around 1 GeV.3 Note that mτb (cid:28) m3/2, and so sequestering addresses
the gravitino problem since the decay of the volume modulus into gravitinos
is kinematically forbidden.

• Given that axions enjoy shift symmetries which are broken only by non-
perturbative eﬀects, the axionic partner ψb of the volume mode τb is sta-
bilized by non-perturbative contributions to the superpotential of the form
W ⊃ Ab e−abTb ∼ e−V 2/3 (cid:28) 1. These tiny eﬀects give rise to a vanishingly
∼ e−V 2/3 ∼ 0. Hence these bulk closed string axions are in
small mass m2
ψb
practice massless and can be produced from the decay of τb [323, 324].

3As in standard Split-SUSY models, we require TeV-scale gauginos for DM and gauge coupling
uniﬁcation. In MSSM-like models we focus on low-energy SUSY to address the hierarchy problem.

172

• Some closed string axions can be removed from the 4D spectrum via the Stück-
elberg mechanism in the process of anomaly cancellation. However, the com-
bination of bulk axions eaten up by an anomalous U (1) is mostly given by an
open string mode, and so ψb survives in the low-energy theory (the situation
is opposite for axions at local singularities) [311].

5.2.3 Volume Modulus Decay Channels

The aim of this section is to compute the ratio chid/cvis which is needed to predict
the eﬀective number of extra neutrino-like species ∆Neﬀ using (5.7).

Decays into Hidden Sector Fields

Some hidden sector dof are model-dependent whereas others are generic features of
LVS models. As pointed out above, bulk closed string axions are always a source
of dark radiation. On top of them, there are local closed string axions which how-
ever tend to be eaten up by anomalous U (1)s (this is always the case for each del
Pezzo singularity) and local open string axions (one of them could be the QCD
axion [206, 236]) whose production from τb decay is negligibly small [323]. More-
over the decay of τb into bulk closed string U (1)s is also a sub-dominant eﬀect [323].
Model-dependent decay channels involve light dof living on hidden D7-branes wrap-
ping either Db or Ds and hidden D3-branes at singularities which are geometrically
separated from the one where the visible sector is localized. However, as explained
in [323], the only decay channels which are not volume or loop suppressed are to
light gauge bosons on the large cycle and to higgses living on sequestered D3s dif-
ferent from the visible sector. Given that the presence of these states is non-generic
and can be avoided by suitable hidden sector model building, we shall focus here
just on τb decays into bulk closed string axions.

The corresponding decay rate takes the form [323, 324]:

ΓΦ→aa = Γ0

⇒

chid = 1 ,

(5.10)

where Φ and a are, respectively, the canonically normalized real and imaginary
parts of the big modulus Tb. This result can be derived from the tree-level Kähler
potential:

which yields the decay rate (5.10).

Decays into Visible Sector Fields

The dominant volume modulus decays into visible sector dof are to higgses via
the GM coupling Z. Additional leading order decay channels can be to SUSY
scalars and higgsinos depending respectively on m0 and ˆµ. On the other hand, as
explained in [323, 324], τb decays into visible gauge bosons are loop suppressed, i.e.
SM (cid:28) 1, whereas decays into matter fermions and gauginos are chirality
cΦ→AA ∼ α2
suppressed, i.e. cΦ→f f ∼ (mf /mΦ)2 (cid:28) 1. The main goal of this section is to compute
the cubic interaction lagrangian which gives rise to the decay of the volume modulus
into higgses, higgsinos, squarks and sleptons.

Decay into Scalar Fields

Let us ﬁrst focus on the volume modulus decays into visible scalar ﬁelds which are
induced by the τb-dependence of both kinetic and mass terms in the total eﬀective
lagrangian L = Lkin − V . Lkin is determined by the leading order Kähler potential:

5.2.4 Dark Radiation Predictions

It is clear from (5.21) and (5.26) that the volume modulus branching ratio into
visible sector dof depends on the size of the soft-terms. Hence the ﬁnal prediction
for dark radiation production has to be studied separately for each diﬀerent visible
sector construction.

MSSM-like Case

Firstly we consider MSSM-like models arising from the ultra-local dS2 case where
all soft-terms are suppressed relative to the volume modulus mass:

0 (cid:39) M 2
m2

1/2 (cid:39) B ˆµ (cid:39) ˆµ2 ∼ M 2

PV 4 (cid:28) m2

Φ ∼ M 2
PV 3 .

(5.27)

Let us brieﬂy review the results for dark radiation production which for this case
have already been studied in [323, 324].

Given that all soft-terms are volume-suppressed with respect to mΦ, only the last
term in (5.21) gives a non-negligible contribution to the volume modulus branching
ratio into visible sector ﬁelds. Thus the leading Φ decay channel is to MSSM higgses

177

via the GM coupling. Using (5.23), we ﬁnd:

ΓΦ→hh = cvisΓ0

with

cvis = 4 × Z 2
2

(cid:115)

1 − 4

(ˆµ2 + m2
0)

m2
Φ

(cid:39) 2Z 2 .

(5.28)

Plugging this value of cvis together with chid = 1 (see (5.10)) into the general ex-
pression (5.7) for extra dark radiation, we obtain the window:

1.53
Z 2

(cid:46) ∆Neﬀ (cid:46) 1.60
Z 2 ,

(5.29)

for 0.2 GeV (cid:46) Trh (cid:46) 10 GeV. Clearly this gives values of ∆Neﬀ larger than unity for
Z = 1. Using the bound (5.8), we see that we need cvis (cid:38) 3 in order to be consistent

with present observational data, implying Z (cid:38)(cid:112)3/2 (cid:39) 1.22.

Split-SUSY-like Case

Let us now analyze dark radiation predictions for Split-SUSY-like scenarios arising
in the dS1 (both local and ultra-local) and local dS2 cases. In these scenarios the
hierarchy among soft-terms is (considering µ and Bµ-terms generated by K):

1/2 (cid:39) ˆµ2 ∼ M 2
M 2

PV 4 (cid:28) m2

0 (cid:39) B ˆµ (cid:39) m2

Φ ∼ M 2
PV 3 .

(5.30)

Φ. In
The main diﬀerence with the MSSM-like case is that now B ˆµ and m2
order to understand if volume modulus decays into SUSY scalars are kinematically
Φ ≤ 1/4, we need therefore to compute the exact value
allowed, i.e. R ≡ m2
of mΦ and compare it with the results derived in Sec. 3.2.3. It turns out that mΦ
depends on the dS mechanism as follows:

0 scale as m2

0/m2

dS1 : m2

Φ =

V

dS2 : m2

Φ =

4asτs

.

(5.31)

Let us analyze each case separately:
• Local and ultra-local dS1 cases: Even if the F-terms contribution to scalar
masses in eq.
(3.56) for the local case can be made small by appropriately
tuning the coeﬃcient cs, the D-terms contribution to m2
0 given by (3.59) cannot
be tuned to small values once the requirement of a dS vacuum is imposed.
Hence for both local and ultra-local cases, m2
0 cannot be made smaller than

178

the value of eq. (3.59) giving:

0 ≥ 2m2
m2

Φ

⇒

R ≥ 2 ,

(5.32)

which is clearly in contradiction with the condition R ≤ 1/4 that has to be
satisﬁed to open up the decay channel of Φ into SUSY scalars. Therefore the
decay of Φ into squarks and sleptons is kinematically forbidden.
Decay to Higgses
Similarly to the MSSM-like case, Φ can still decay to higgs bosons via the GM
term in (5.21). Given that mΦ < m0, when Φ decays at energies of order mΦ,
EWSB has already taken place at the scale m0.4 The gauge eigenstates hi
i = 1, ..., 8 given in (5.17) then get rotated into 8 mass eigenstates. 4 higgs
dof which we denote by A0, H 0, H± remain heavy and acquire a mass of order
0, and so the decay of Φ into these ﬁelds is kinematically forbidden.
m2
The remaining 4 dof are the 3 would-be Goldstone bosons G0 and G± which
become the longitudinal components of Z 0 and W ±, and the ordinary SM
higgs ﬁeld h0. The Φ decay rate into light higgs dof can be obtained from
the last term in (5.21) by writing the gauge eigenstates in terms of the mass
eigenstates as [51]:

(cid:39) m2

Hd

h1 = ReG+ sin β + ReH + cos β ,
√
2vd + h0 sin β + H 0 cos β ,
h3 =
h5 = −G0 cos β + A0 sin β ,

h4 =
h6 = G0 sin β + A0 cos β ,
h8 = ImG+ cos β − ImH + sin β ,

(5.33)
d(cid:105) and tan β ≡ vu/vd. Since in Split-SUSY-like
where vu ≡ (cid:104)H 0
models tan β ∼ O(1) in order to reproduce the correct higgs mass [349, 350],
the interaction lagrangian simpliﬁes to:

(5.35)

Decay to Higgsinos
Φ can also decay to higgsinos via the interaction lagrangian (5.25). We need
only to check if this decay is kinematically allowed. In Split-SUSY-like models
EWSB takes place at the scale m0 where the following relations hold:

ˆµ2 =

In the case of universal boundary conditions for the higgs masses, i.e. mHu =
mHd = m0 at the GUT scale, the ˆµ-term has necessarily to be of order the
scalar masses m0 since for tan β ∼ O (1) the ﬁrst EWSB condition in (5.36)
simpliﬁes to:

ˆµ2 (cid:39) m2

Hd

tan2 β − 1

(cid:39) m2
0 ,

(5.37)

Hu runs down to values smaller than m2
Hd

given that m2
due to RG ﬂow eﬀects.
On the other hand, ˆµ could be much smaller than m0 for non-universal bound-
if mHu (cid:54)= mHd at the GUT scale. In fact, in Split-SUSY
ary conditions, i.e.
Hu is positive around the scale m0, and so the ﬁrst EWSB condition
models m2
in (5.36) for ˆµ (cid:28) m0 becomes:

m2
Hd

(cid:39) m2

Hu tan2 β .

(5.38)

This condition can be satisﬁed at the scale m0 for a proper choice of boundary
conditions at the GUT scale with mHu > mHd. Let us point out that, if ˆµ is
determined by Kähler potential contributions (see Tab. 3.1), ˆµ is suppressed
with respect to m0 but, if ˆµ is generated by non-perturbative eﬀects in W ,
ˆµ can be of order m0. In this case, the parametrization of the ˆµ-term (5.19)
reproduces the correct τb-dependence of the non-perturbatively induced ˆµ-term
if α = 3n + 1.5 If we parametrize the ratio between ˆµ and mΦ as ˜c ≡ ˆµ/mΦ,
the decay of Φ into higgsinos is kinematically allowed only for ˜c ≤ 1/2. Using
5If the instanton number is n = 1, the ˆµ-term can easily be of order mΦ since cµ,W is a ﬂux-
dependent tunable coeﬃcient. For example, setting ξ = as = 1 and gs = 0.1, the requirement
ˆµ (cid:39) mΦ implies that cµ,W (cid:39) W0/(4V 1/6). For W0 (cid:39) 10 and V (cid:39) 107 we get cµ,W (cid:39) 0.2.

180

(5.26), this decay rate takes the form (where we set n = 1 ⇔ α = 4):

Consistency with present observational data, i.e. ∆Neﬀ (cid:46) 1, requires Z (cid:38) 1.68.
• Local dS2 case: The situation seems more promising in this case since in the
local limit the D-terms contribution to m2
0 is volume-suppressed with respect
to m2
In this case it is therefore
possible to tune the coeﬃcient cs to obtain R ≤ 1/4. By comparing the
second term in (5.31) with (3.56), this implies that cs has to be tuned so

not modify the leading order scalar potential, and so the mass of the volume
modulus is still given by (5.31). However, in order to reproduce a correct
ultra-local limit (3.50), we need to change the parametrization of the Kähler

τs (cid:28) τb. The new ultra-local limit is now given by cs = cloop = 1/3.
These new cloop-dependent corrections in (5.43) aﬀect the ﬁnal result for scalar
masses and can therefore open up the Φ decay channel to SUSY scalars. In
fact, the result (3.56) for scalar masses in the local case gets modiﬁed to:

As can be seen from Fig. 5.1, there is now a wide region of the parameter space
where the Φ decay to SUSY scalars is allowed.
We ﬁnally point out that gs corrections to the Kähler matter metric aﬀect the
result for scalar masses only in the local case since in the ultra-local limit m0
is generated by eﬀects (D-terms for dS1 and F-terms of S and U-moduli for
dS2) which are sensitive only to the leading order expression of ˜Kα.

Let us now analyze the ﬁnal prediction for dark radiation production for Split-
SUSY-like models where the decay channel of Φ into SUSY scalars is kinematically
allowed.

Dark Radiation Results

We start by parametrizing the scalar mass m0 in terms of the volume mode mass
mΦ as m0 = c mΦ and the ˆµ-term as µ = ˜c mΦ so that the corresponding kinematic
2 and ˜c ≤ 1
constraints for Φ decays into SUSY scalars and higgsinos become c ≤ 1
2.

the decay channel of Φ into SUSY scalars is kinematically allowed.

Parametrizing also the B ˆµ-term as in (3.86) and using the fact that for Split-SUSY-
like models we have in (5.19) β = γ = 9/2 and α = 4,6 the leading order cubic
lagrangian is given by the sum of (5.21) and (5.25):

Contrary to the MSSM-like case, now the decay of the volume modulus into squarks
and sleptons through mass terms is kinematically allowed and also the decay rate
into higgses is enhanced due to mass terms and B ˆµ couplings. Using (5.22), the
total decay rate into squarks and sleptons reads:

(5.47)

where N = 90 is the number of real scalar dof of the MSSM,7 except for the higgses.

6We focus on the case where the ˆµ-term is generated by non-perturbative eﬀects in W since
when ˆµ is generated by K, it turns out to be very suppressed with respect to m0, i.e. ˜c (cid:28) 1, and
so it gives rise to a negligible contribution to the branching ratio of Φ.

On the other hand, the decay rate into higgs bosons receives contributions from

both mass and GM terms. Using (5.22) we obtain:

where

cvis = c0 + c1 + c2 + d2 .

The ﬁnal prediction for dark radiation production is then given by (5.7) with chid = 1,
g∗(Tdec) = 10.75 and g∗(Trh) = 86.25 for Trh (cid:38) 0.7 GeV.8 The results are plotted in
Fig. 5.2 where we have set cB,K = 1, Z = 1 and we are considering a conservative
case in which the decay into higgsinos is negligible, i.e. ˜c = 0. For c > 0.2, the vast
majority of the parameter space yields ∆Neﬀ (cid:46) 1, in perfect agreement with present

It is interesting to notice that, contrary to the MSSM-like case, dark radiation
over-production can now be avoided if the GM term is absent or it is very suppressed.
In fact even for Z = 0, ∆Neﬀ (cid:46) 1 if c (cid:38) 0.23, as a consequence of the fact that in this
region of the parameter space almost the whole suppression of ∆Neﬀ is due to the
decay into scalar ﬁelds. The predictions for ∆Neﬀ for diﬀerent values of the GM cou-
pling Z = 0 (blue line), Z = 1 (red line) and Z = 2 (green line) are shown in Fig. 5.3.

For ˜c (cid:54)= 0 ∆Neﬀ is even further suppressed than what is shown in Fig. 5.2
and 5.3 but the correction is at the percent level in the interesting region where
the decay into scalars dominates Γvis. For example including the eﬀect of decays

into higgsinos and setting ˜c (cid:39) 1/

slepton (3 families).

and ˜c = 0.

Note that ∆Neﬀ can be further suppressed by choosing cB,K > 1, namely by
enhancing the contribution due to the B ˆµ-term. However the decay scale mΦ is just
slightly larger than the EWSB scale m0 where the 4 dof of the two higgs doublets get
rotated into the heavy higgs mass eigenstates A0, H 0, H±, the SM higgs h0 and the
longitudinal components G0, G± of the vector bosons Z, W ±. Hence the B ˆµ-term
gets reabsorbed into the mass terms for A0, H 0, H± and h0, G0, G±, and so varying
cB,K does not enhance Γvis which receives its main contributions from the decay
into squarks, sleptons and heavy higgses through the mass term (assuming that is
kinematically allowed) and into all higgs dof via the GM term. These considerations
will become more clear in the next section where we will take into account corrections
due to RG ﬂow eﬀects. A possible way-out could be the separation between the
EWSB scale and the volume modulus mass, which translates into requiring c (cid:28) 1.

RG Flow Eﬀects

The results obtained above have to be corrected due to RG ﬂow eﬀects from the
string scale to the actual scale mΦ where the modulus decay takes place [344]. How-
ever these corrections do not alter qualitatively our results since Φ interacts only
gravitationally and the running of squarks and sleptons in Split-SUSY models is
almost absent [350]. For sake of completeness, let us study these RG ﬂow eﬀects in
detail.

The soft-terms m0, ˆµ and B ˆµ entering in the interaction lagrangian (5.21) are
just boundary conditions for the RG ﬂow and should instead be evaluated at the
scale mΦ where the light modulus Φ decays. The RG equations for the ﬁrst and
second generation of squarks and sleptons are given by:

α = m2

0 +

cα,aKa ,

(5.53)

a=1

where cα,a is the weak hypercharge squared for each SUSY scalar and the RG run-
ning contributions Ka are proportional to gaugino masses [51]. Given that in Split-
SUSY-like models gaugino masses are hierarchically lighter than scalar masses, the
RG running of ﬁrst and second generation squarks and sleptons is a negligible eﬀect.
Thus we can consider their mass at the scale mΦ as still given by m0 to a high level
of accuracy.

The situation for the third generation is slightly trickier since there are additional
contributions from large Yukawa couplings. Using mSUGRA boundary conditions,

186

term couplings. Given that for sequestered scenarios the A-terms scale as M1/2 [1],
the contribution 2|ai|2 can be neglected with respect to the ﬁrst term in each Xi.
Moreover Xt, Xb and Xτ are all positive, and so the RG equations (5.54) and (5.55)
drive the scalar masses to smaller values at lower energies. This has a two-fold
implication:

• When m0 > mΦ, RG running eﬀects could lower m0 to values smaller than
mΦ/2 so that the decay channel to SUSY scalars opens up at the scale mΦ.
However this never happens since RG eﬀects are negligible.

• When m0 ≤ mΦ/2, no one of the scalars becomes heavier than the volume
modulus if R < 1
4 at the boundary energy scale. On the other hand, RG
running eﬀects could still lower the scalar masses too much, suppressing the
Φ decay rate to SUSY scalars. However this does not happen since RG eﬀects
are negligible.

used SusyHD [351] to run the Yukawa couplings from the top mass scale up to m0
combined with SARAH [352] to run them from m0 up to the GUT scale.9 These
runnings have been computed at order one loop. Using the values of the Yukawa
couplings obtained at the GUT scale, we have been able to compute the running of
scalars, ˆµ, B ˆµ and the GM coupling Z down to the scale of the decay mΦ. Fig. 5.4

5.3 Conclusions

Extra dark radiation is a very promising window for new physics beyond the Stan-
dard Model. Its presence is a generic feature of string models where some of the
moduli are stabilized by perturbative eﬀects since the corresponding axionic partners
remain very light and can behave as extra neutrino-like species [311]. These light hid-
den sector dof are produced by the decay of the lightest modulus [283, 284, 285, 286]
leading to ∆Neﬀ (cid:54)= 0 [323, 324, 343].

In this chapter we performed a general analysis of axionic dark radiation produc-
tion in sequestered LVS models where the visible sector is localized on D3-branes
at singularities [99, 179, 206, 236]. These models yield a very interesting post-
inﬂationary cosmological history where reheating is driven by the decay of the light-
est modulus Φ with a mass of order mΦ ∼ 107 GeV which leads to a reheating
temperature of order Trh ∼ 1 GeV. The gravitino mass is much larger than mΦ
(m3/2 ∼ 1010 GeV), so avoiding any gravitino problem [316, 317]. Low-energy SUSY
can still be achieved due to sequestering eﬀects that keep the supersymmetric part-
ners light. Gauginos are around the TeV-scale whereas squarks and sleptons can
either be as light as the gauginos or as heavy as the lightest modulus Φ depending
on the moduli dependence of the matter Kähler metric and the mechanism respon-
sible for achieving a dS vacuum [1].

The ﬁnal prediction for dark radiation production due to the decay of the volume
modulus into ultra-light bulk closed string axions depends on the details of the visible
sector construction:

1. MSSM-like case:

MSSM-like models arise from the ultra-local dS2 case where the leading visible
sector decay channel of Φ is to higgses via the GM coupling Z. The simplest
model with two higgs doublets and Z = 1 gives 1.53 (cid:46) ∆Neﬀ (cid:46) 1.60 for
500 GeV (cid:46) Trh (cid:46) 5 GeV [323, 324]. Values of ∆Neﬀ smaller than unity require
Z (cid:38) 1.22 or more than two higgs doublets.

2. Split-SUSY-like case with m0 > mΦ/2:

Local and ultra-local dS1 cases give rise to Split-SUSY-like scenarios where
scalar masses m0 receive a contribution from D-terms which cannot be made
smaller than mΦ/2. Thus the decay of Φ into squarks and sleptons is kine-
matically forbidden. The leading visible sector decay channel of Φ is again
to higgses via the GM coupling Z. However, given that EWSB takes place

191

at the scale m0 which in these cases is larger than the decay scale mΦ, the
volume mode Φ can decay only to the 4 light higgs dof. For a shift-symmetric
higgs sector with Z = 1, the ﬁnal prediction for dark radiation production
is 3.07 (cid:46) ∆Neﬀ (cid:46) 3.20. Consistency with present experimental data, i.e.
∆Neﬀ (cid:46) 1, requires Z (cid:38) 1.68. In most of the parameter space of Split-SUSY-
like models a correct radiative EWSB can be achieved only if the ˆµ-term is of
order the scalar masses. Hence, depending on the exact value of ˆµ, the decay
of Φ into higgsinos could not be mass suppressed. However it gives rise just
to a negligible contribution to ∆Neﬀ.
3. Split-SUSY-like case with m0 ≤ mΦ/2:

Given that in the local dS2 case the D-terms contribution to scalar masses
is negligible, the decay of Φ into SUSY scalars can become kinematically al-
lowed. In fact, thanks to the inclusion of string loop corrections to the Kähler
potential [166, 168], a large region of the underlying parameter space features
m0 ≤ mΦ/2. Hence the ﬁnal prediction for ∆Neﬀ gets considerably reduced
with respect to the previous two cases since, in addition to decays into higgses
via the GM term, leading order contributions to the branching ratio to visible
sector particles involve decays into squarks and sleptons, decays into heavy
higgses induced by mass terms and possible decays into higgsinos depending
on the exact value of the ˆµ-term. Depending on the exact value of m0, the
simplest model with Z = 1 gives 0.14 (cid:46) ∆Neﬀ (cid:46) 1.6. Hence these models fea-
ture values of ∆Neﬀ in perfect agreement with present observational bounds.
Note that dark radiation overproduction can be avoided even for Z = 0 due
to the new decay channels to squarks and sleptons.

We ﬁnally studied corrections to these results due to RG ﬂow eﬀects from the
string scale Ms ∼ 1015 GeV to the volume mode mass mΦ ∼ 107 GeV where the
actual decay takes place. However these corrections do not modify our predictions
since the RG running of SUSY scalar masses is a negligible eﬀect in Split-SUSY-like
models and radiative corrections to mΦ are tiny since moduli are only gravitational
coupled.

large ﬁeld inﬂationary models with r (cid:38) O(0.01) would imply a high value of H
together with a small value of m3/2, in clear tension with the theoretical bounds
from volume destabilization problems.

Several ideas have been proposed in the literature to overcome this tension be-
tween TeV-scale supersymmetry and large ﬁeld inﬂation. Here we brieﬂy summarize
them:

(cid:113) m3/2

1. The relation H 2M 2
P

(cid:46) Vbarrier would be independent of m3/2 in models where
the energy barrier and the gravitino mass are two uncorrelated quantities.
Racetrack superpotentials [353], models of natural inﬂation as in [355] or mod-
els of D-terms inﬂation from ﬁeld-dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos [356] can provide
viable models where Vbarrier is decoupled from m3/2.

2. The KKLT bound H (cid:46) m3/2 and the LVS bound H (cid:46) m3/2

apply
just to the inﬂationary era, and so in these expression m3/2 is the gravitino
mass during inﬂation which might be diﬀerent from the present value of the
gravitino mass. This is possible if m3/2 = eK/2|W| (cid:39) W0V MP evolves just
after the end of inﬂation. Two viable realizations include inﬂationary models
where the inﬂaton coincides with the volume mode V so that V relaxes from
small to large values during inﬂation [354] or where the inﬂaton is a complex
structure modulus or a matter ﬁeld so that W relaxes from large to small
values during inﬂation [357]. Another option is to consider models with two

couples to the ﬁeld X whose F-term drives inﬂation, the volume’s vacuum
expectation value (VEV) during inﬂation would be determined by the F-terms
potential of X which however vanishes after the end of inﬂation when V is ﬁxed
by a more standard KKLT or LVS mechanism. This kind of models with a
Kähler potential coupling between V and X have been studied in [358] whereas
superpotential interactions between V and X have been analyzed in [359].

3. Another possible way-out to reconcile low-energy supersymmetry with high
scale inﬂation is to consider models where the visible sector is sequestered from
the sources of supersymmetry breaking so that the soft-terms are much smaller
than the gravitino mass [1, 182]. This can be the case for compactiﬁcations
where the visible sector is localized on fractional D3-branes at singularities
which can lead to Msoft ∼ m3/2

.

m3/2
MP

Let us point out that all the solutions listed above require a high degree of tuning
except for the sequestered case which might be however not enough to completely

194

remove all the tension between observable tensor modes and TeV-scale supersym-
metry. Moreover, it is technically rather complicated to provide consistent string
models where these solutions are explicitly realized. Therefore they are at the mo-
ment at the level of string-inspired toy-models without a concrete string embedding
where one can check if there is enough tuning freedom to achieve the amount of ﬁne
tuning needed to reproduce all the desired phenomenological details.

In this chapter we shall provide a ﬁrst step towards an explicit stringy embed-
ding of the case where the volume mode plays the rôle of the inﬂaton evolving from
small to large values after the end of inﬂation [354]. We will describe a possible
microscopic origin of the potential terms used in [354] to create an inﬂection point
at small volumes around which slow-roll inﬂation can occur. Moreover, we shall also
perform a deeper analysis of the relation between the position of the inﬂection point
and the minimum with the tuning of the ﬂux superpotential.

Before presenting the details of our analysis, let us stress some key-features of

the model under study:

• In order to have an evolving gravitino mass, we focus on models where the in-
ﬂaton is the volume mode V. Given that we work in an eﬀective supergravity
theory where the Kähler potential has a logarithmic dependence on V, each
term in the inﬂationary potential will be a negative exponential of the canon-
ically normalized volume mode Φ ∼ lnV, i.e. V ⊃ e−kΦ. This form of the
potential is reminiscent of Starobinsky-like models which have a rather large
inﬂationary scale since they are at the boarder between large and small ﬁeld
models [360]. However Starobinsky-like potentials feature also an inﬂaton-
independent constant which can never appear in cases where the inﬂaton is
the volume mode V since V couples to all sources of energy because of the
Weyl rescaling needed to obtain the correct eﬀective action.1

• The best way to achieve volume inﬂation is therefore to consider a potential
which has enough tuning freedom to create an inﬂection point and then re-
alize inﬂation in the vicinity of the inﬂection point. The price to pay is that
this inﬂationary scenario turns out to be rather ﬁne tuned and it is neces-
sarily a small ﬁeld model with a sub-Planckian ﬁeld range during inﬂation
∆Φ ∼ 0.4 MP, unobservable tensor modes of order r ∼ 10−9 and low Hubble
scale H ∼ 1010 GeV. Hence this approach cannot solve completely the tension
1Starobinsky-like models with large r and a constant inﬂaton-independent constant can instead
be obtained in models where the inﬂaton is a Kähler modulus diﬀerent from the volume mode [361].

195

(cid:113) m3/2

between large tensor modes and TeV-scale supersymmetry. Still it provides
a big step forward especially if combined with a sequestered visible sector so
that low-energy supersymmetry can be safely reconciled with a high gravitino
mass.

MP

• In LVS models where H > m3/2

and the inﬂaton is the volume mode,
the destabilization problem of [353] becomes an overshooting problem since
the inﬂaton has an initial energy which is larger than the barrier to decom-
pactiﬁcation. The solution to this problem via radiation production after the
end of inﬂation has already been discussed in [354], and so we shall not dwell
on this issue.

• In the models under study, the Hubble scale during inﬂation is set by the
3/2 which is much larger than the gravitino
due to the volume evolution. Hence the Hubble scale H

can be much larger than mtoday

We shall analyze both the single modulus and the two moduli case focusing on three
diﬀerent visible sector realizations which lead to:

1. High-scale SUSY models:

in this case the requirement of low-energy super-
symmetry is relaxed and the value of the gravitino mass both during and after
inﬂation is huge. The volume mode evolves from values of order 100 during in-
ﬂation to values of order 200 after the end of inﬂation. The ﬂux superpotential
has to be tuned to values of order W0 ∼ 10−5 in order to reproduce the correct
amplitude of the density perturbations. Thus the order of magnitude of the
3/2 ∼ 1011
gravitino mass during and after inﬂation is the same, minf
GeV corresponding to H ∼ 1010 GeV. Due to the small value of V, in this case
the validity of the eﬀective ﬁeld theory approach is not fully under control.

3/2 ∼ mtoday

2. Non-sequestered models: in these models during inﬂation the volume is of order
V ∼ 105 and W0 ∼ 1 giving a gravitino mass of order minf
3/2 ∼ 1014 GeV which
leads again to H ∼ 1010 GeV. After the end of inﬂation the volume evolves to
V ∼ 1015 as required to get TeV-scale supersymmetry since the present value
of the gravitino mass becomes mtoday

3/2 ∼ 10 TeV [155].

196

3. Sequestered models:

in these models inﬂection point volume inﬂation takes
place again for values of order V ∼ 105 and W0 ∼ 1 which yield minf
3/2 ∼ 1014
GeV and H ∼ 1010 GeV. After the end of inﬂation the volume evolves instead
to V ∼ 107 corresponding to mtoday
3/2 ∼ 1011 GeV, as required to get low-
energy supersymmetry gaugino masses in sequestered scenarios where M1/2 ∼
m3/2

∼ 10 TeV [1, 182].

This chapter is organized as follows. Sec. 6.2 is a brief review of the basic
concepts of inﬂection point inﬂation which will be used in the rest of the chapter
while in Sec. 6.3 we describe a possible microscopic origin of all the terms in the
inﬂationary potential which are needed to develop an inﬂection point at small values
of V together with a dS minimum at larger values of the volume mode. In Sec. 6.4 we
study the single modulus case presenting ﬁrst an analytical qualitative description of
the inﬂationary dynamics and then performing an exact numerical analysis. The two
moduli case typical of LVS models is instead discussed in Sec. 6.5 before presenting
our conclusions in Sec. 6.6. This chapter is based on [3].

6.2 Inﬂection Point Inﬂation

In this section we brieﬂy review the generic features of inﬂection point inﬂation,
closely following [362] and [363]. We summarize the main points and discuss the
tuning involved in these models.

The basic assumption is that inﬂation takes place around an inﬂection point
along some arbitrary direction in ﬁeld space. The scalar potential around such an
inﬂection point can always be expanded as:

V = Vip

1 + λ1(φ − φip) +

(φ − φip)3 +

λ3
3!

λ4
4!

(φ − φip)4 + . . .

,

(6.4)

where φip denotes the position of the inﬂection point. Given that we shall focus on
cases where the ﬁeld excursion during the inﬂationary period is small, i.e. (φ−φip) (cid:28)
1, the quartic term can be safely neglected. We therefore ﬁnd that it suﬃces to
analyze the following potential:

(cid:18)

(cid:18)

V = Vip

(cid:19)

(cid:19)

.

(6.5)

1 + λ1(φ − φip) +

(φ − φip)3

(6.6)

(6.7)

which have to be evaluated at horizon exit where φ = φ∗. Note that in (6.6) and
(6.7) we approximated V (cid:39) Vip in the denominator, which is a good approximation
for small ﬁeld models where (φ − φip) (cid:28) 1. Notice that if λ3 (cid:38) 1 this small ﬁeld
condition has to be satisﬁed in order to obtain η (cid:28) 1. If instead λ3 is tuned such that
λ3 (cid:28) 1, the condition η (cid:28) 1 could be satisﬁed also for large ﬁeld values but then
the approximation (6.5) would be under control only by tuning all the coeﬃcients of
the expansion. We shall therefore focus only on the case (φ− φip) (cid:28) 1. The number
of e-foldings is given by:

(cid:90) φ

(cid:114) 2

Ne(φ∗) =

(cid:35)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)φ∗

φend

(φ − φip)

.

(6.8)

In order to have enough e-foldings we need λ1 (cid:28) 1, which is also needed to get
 (cid:28) 1, and (φ − φip) (cid:38) √
λ1 so that the arc-tangent does not give a small number.

Thus the slow-roll parameter η turns out to be larger than  since:

1 (cid:28) η ∼ (φ − φip) (cid:38)(cid:112)

 ∼ λ2

λ1 (cid:28) 1 .

Therefore the spectral index in these models is essentially given by η:

ns − 1 = 2η(φ∗) − 6(φ∗) (cid:39) 2η(φ∗) ,

(6.9)

(6.10)

By using (6.8), it is possible to rewrite the spectral index as a function of the number
of e-foldings as:

ns − 1 (cid:39) − 4
Ne

+

2
3

λ1λ3Ne .

(6.11)

Since 1− 4
(cid:39) 0.93 for Ne (cid:39) 60, it is evident that for a very small λ1 (or equivalently
a very ﬂat inﬂection point) the spectral index asymptotes to 0.93. We have therefore
to use (6.11) to determine the value of λ1 that gives a value of ns in agreement with

Ne

198

recent Planck data, i.e. ns = 0.9655 ± 0.0062 (68% CL) [69]. We ﬁnd:

ns = 0.965 ⇒ λ1 = 7.92 · 10−4 λ−1

3

for

Ne = 60 .

(6.12)

In these small ﬁeld models, the tensor-to-scalar ratio r turns out to be unobservable
since:

r = 16 (cid:39) 8λ2

1 (cid:39) 5.01 · 10−6λ−2

3

for

Ne = 60.

(6.13)

Successful inﬂation not only gives rise to the correct spectral tilt and tensor frac-
tion but does so at the right energy scale. The normalization of scalar density
perturbations in these models can be written as:

∆2 =

1

24π2

V


(cid:39) 1
12π2

Vip
λ2
1

(cid:39) 2.4 · 10−9 .

(6.14)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)φ∗

Once the parameter λ3 is ﬁxed, (6.12) gives the value of λ1 which produces the
correct spectral index, ns = 0.965, and (6.14) ﬁxes the value of Vip which reproduces
the observed amplitude of the density perturbations.
In turn, (6.13) yields the
prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio r.

6.3 Microscopic Origin of the Inﬂationary Potential

In this section we will try to describe a possible microscopic origin of volume modulus
inﬂation. The tree-level stabilization of the dilaton S and of complex structure
moduli proceeds as described in Sec. 2.2.1. In particular we will consider two explicit
setups:

a) Single modulus case

In this setup we have a single Kähler modulus Tb = τb +icb where cb is an axion
ﬁeld and τb controls the overall volume: V = τ 3/2
. The canonical normalization
of the inﬂaton ﬁeld τb can be inferred from its kinetic terms:

b

Lkin =

3
4τ 2
b

∂µτb∂µτb ,

so that the canonically normalized volume ﬁeld can be written as:

(cid:114)3

2

(cid:114)2

3

Φ =

ln τb (cid:39)

lnV .

In this setup the visible sector can be realized in two diﬀerent ways:

199

(6.15)

(6.16)

i) The visible sector lives on a stack of D7-branes wrapping the 4-cycle
associated to τb. Given that the visible sector gauge coupling is set by τb
as α−1
vis = τb, the late-time value of the volume has to be of order 100 in
vis (cid:39) 25. This
order to reproduce a correct phenomenological value of α−1
model is characterized by high scale SUSY.

ii) The visible sector is localized on D3-branes at singularities obtained by
collapsing a blow-up mode to zero size due to D-terms stabilization [1,
182]. In this case the visible sector coupling is set by the dilaton, and
so the volume can take much larger values of order V (cid:39) 107 which lead
to TeV-scale supersymmetry via sequestering eﬀects. In the presence of
desequestering perturbative or non-perturbative eﬀects [183], low-energy
SUSY requires larger values of V of order V ∼ 1014.

b) Two moduli case

In this setup we start with two Kähler moduli: Tb = τb + icb and Ts = τs + ics
with τb (cid:29) τs. The CY volume takes the swiss-Cheese form:

V = τ 3/2

b − τ 3/2

s

.

(6.17)

The modulus which plays the role of the inﬂaton will still be τb, and so its
canonical normalization is given by (6.16). However, in this setup the visible
sector can be realized in three diﬀerent ways:

i) The visible sector lives on a stack of D7-branes wrapping τb (for an explicit
CY construction see [181]). As explained above, in this case V has to be
of order 100 for phenomenological reasons and the SUSY scale is very
high.

ii) The visible sector lives on a stack of D7-branes wrapping τs (see again [181]
for an explicit model). Given that the visible sector gauge coupling is now
independent on τb since α−1
vis = τs, the volume can take large values. A
particularly interesting value is V (cid:39) 1014 which leads to TeV-scale soft-
terms, as in standard non-sequestered LVS models.

iii) The visible sector is localized on D3-branes at singularities (see [206, 236]
for explicit global dS models) obtained by collapsing a blow-up mode to
zero size due to D-terms stabilization. Since the gauge kinetic function
of D3-branes is given by S, V can take large values. Due to sequestering
eﬀects, in this case TeV-scale superpartners require V (cid:39) 107.

200

α(cid:48)-corrections
If W0 (cid:54)= 0, the no-scale structure is broken by α(cid:48)3-corrections which show up in the
Kähler potential as in eq. (2.99). The contribution of the α(cid:48)-correction to the scalar
potential looks like:

V = eK(cid:16)

K TbT bDTbW DT b

W − 3|W|2(cid:17) ⊃ V0 e−

(6.18)

where we have deﬁned:

V0 =

8π

3 ˆξ|W0|2

4

.

(6.19)

V0 is a free parameter which can be tuned to get inﬂection point inﬂation with the
right COBE normalization and a large volume minimum.

Non-perturbative Eﬀects

Given that non-perturbative eﬀects are exponentially suppressed, they tend to give
rise to negligible contributions to the scalar potential. However, in the two moduli
case, Ts-dependent non-perturbative eﬀects could lead to potentially large contribu-
tions, as in the LVS setup, described in Sec. 2.2.1. With the right normalization the
LVS potential takes the form:

with the right COBE normalization and number of e-foldings.

with c2 the second Chern class of the CY X and ˆDi is a basis of harmonic (1, 1)-forms
allowing for the usual expansion of the Kähler form J as:

(cid:90)

h(1,1)(cid:88)

Higher Derivative α(cid:48)-corrections

Additional contributions to the scalar potential from higher derivative corrections to
the 10D action have been computed in [162]. These corrections have the same higher
dimensional origin as the α(cid:48)3-term (6.18). Both stem from the α(cid:48)3R4 contribution
to the in 10D Type IIB action. The eﬀect of these four derivative corrections is
to modify the equations of motion of the auxiliary ﬁelds (F-terms) thereby giving
rise to corrections to the kinetic terms, new quartic derivative couplings and more
importantly new contributions to the scalar potential. These F 4 corrections depend
on the CY topology and take the generic form:
VF 4 = − ˆλ|W0|4

(6.23)

V 4 Πiti ,

where Πi are topological integers deﬁned as:

J =

ˆDi ,

ti

(6.25)

i=1

with ti being two-cycle volumes. The parameter ˆλ is expected to be of order ˆξ/χ(X),
with χ(X) being the CY Euler number. For model building purposes, we will take
it to be a real negative constant.

Depending on the details of the compactiﬁcation space, these new terms can take
diﬀerent forms, yielding contributions to the scalar potential that scale diﬀerently
with the overall volume.
In the simplest single Kähler modulus case where tb =
√
τb (cid:39) V 1/3, the correction (6.23) takes the form:

where we deﬁned:

(6.26)

(6.27)

The form of these corrections for the two moduli case can be derived by focusing
on the CP4
[1,1,1,6,9] case where the volume can be written in terms of the two-cycle
volumes t1 and t5 as [364]:

V =

(3t2

(6.28)

implying that the four-cycles are given by:

= t5(t1 + 3t5) and τ5 =

One can deﬁne τ4 as the linear combination:

τ4 = τ5 − 6τ1 =

⇒ t1 =

(6.30)

that t5 > 0 when τ5 (cid:29) τ4 we get:

String Loop Corrections

As we have observed in Sec. 2.2.1 the K¨ahler potential receives string loop corrections
as in eq. (2.103) and eq. (2.104). The ﬁnal contribution to the scalar potential can

(6.36)

where κgs is a real tunable number.

Anti D3-branes

Anti D3-branes yield a positive contribution to the scalar potential which in general
provides a viable mechanism to realize a dS minimum. More precisely, the introduc-
tion of anti D3-branes in the compactiﬁcation produces a term in the scalar potential
of the form [146]:

VD3 =

κD3 V0V 2 = κD3 V0 e−√

6Φ ,

(6.37)

where κD3 is a positive real number which can be tuned to realize inﬂection point
inﬂation.

Charged Hidden Matter Fields

The possible presence on the big cycle of a hidden sector with matter ﬁelds φ
charged under an anomalous U (1) leads to the generation of moduli-dependent
Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) terms. The corresponding D-terms potential reads:

(cid:0)qφ|φ|2 − ξb

(cid:1)2 ,

VD =

(6.38)

(6.39)

where fb = Tb and qφ is the U (1)-charge of φ while the FI-term is given by:

ξb = − qb

V 2/3 ,

204

where qb the U (1)-charge of Tb. Since supersymmetry breaking eﬀects generate a
mass for φ of order the gravitino mass, the total scalar potential becomes:

3/2|φ|2 + O(cid:0)V−3(cid:1) ,

V = VD + cm2

(6.40)

where c is an O(1) coeﬃcient which can be positive or negative depending on hidden
sector model building details. Integrating out φ leads to a new contribution which
has been used to obtain dS vacua and takes the form [206, 236]:

Vhid =

Total Scalar Potential

The total scalar potential that we shall consider can in general be written as:

Vtot = Vα(cid:48) + Vnp + VF 4 + Vgs + VD3 + Vhid ,

(6.42)

where Vα(cid:48) is the universal α(cid:48)-correction (6.18), Vnp is the non-perturbative gener-
ated potential (6.22) which is non-negligible only in the two moduli case, VF 4 are
the higher derivative eﬀects (6.26) and (6.33), Vgs is the string loop potential (6.36),
VD3 is the contribution (6.37) from anti D3-branes and Vhid is the potential (6.41)
generated by the F-terms of charged hidden matter ﬁelds.

Let us now add all these diﬀerent contributions to the total scalar potential for

the single modulus and the two moduli case separately:

a) Single modulus case

In this simple model with only a single Kähler modulus, the generic expression
for the scalar potential is:

V (Φ) = V0

Φ + κF 4 e

Φ + κD3 e−√

(6.43)

In this setup the post-inﬂationary dS minimum is generated by the interplay
between the universal α(cid:48)3 term and the two terms proportional to κD3 and κhid,
with the inﬂationary inﬂection point arising at smaller volumes in a region
where the ﬁrst three terms in (6.43) are comparable in size.

2Note that qb and qφ must have the same sign otherwise the minimum for |φ| would be at zero.

b) Two moduli case

In the two moduli case, the total scalar potential (6.42) contains at least six
terms. However, as we shall see in the next section, we need just ﬁve tunable
parameters in order to get inﬂection point inﬂation. We shall therefore neglect
the last term in (6.42) which might be removed by a model building choice.
We stress that this choice does not aﬀect our ﬁnal results. In fact, if instead
we neglected VD3 in (6.42), we would obtain qualitatively the same results.
Thus in this case the total inﬂationary potential becomes:

(cid:104)(cid:0)1 − κnpΦ3/2(cid:1) e−

Here we are including only the leading term of the higher derivatives correc-
tions (6.33) which is proportional to κF 4
. Hence we are assuming that the
term proportional to κF 4
is either very suppressed (a natural possibility given
its volume scaling) or exactly vanishing.

6.4 Single Field Dynamics

In this section we study the eﬀective single ﬁeld inﬂationary dynamics for both the
single modulus and the two moduli case. A deeper analysis of the eﬀect of the
heavy ﬁeld for the two moduli case will be performed in Sec. 6.5. In order to obtain
a phenomenologically viable model, we should require that:

1. There is an inﬂection point at Φip.

2. The potential is such that the COBE normalization is satisﬁed and the number

of e-foldings is Ne (cid:39) 60.

3. There is a large volume de Sitter minimum at Φmin.

As we will see below, these requirements translate into ﬁve conditions on the scalar
potential, and so we need ﬁve tunable free parameters.

6.4.1 Analytical Discussion

As a ﬁrst step, let us discuss the strategy used to determine the free parameters
in (6.43) and (6.44) in order to get inﬂection point inﬂation. The position of the
inﬂection point Φip and the minimum Φmin can be chosen independently with the

206

only constraint (apart from Φmin > Φip) being:
⇔

√
Vip = e

3

2 Φip (cid:38) 103

Φip (cid:38) 5 ,

(6.45)

in order to trust the eﬀective ﬁeld theory during inﬂation.

Once Φip and Φmin are chosen, we impose that the scalar potential actually
produces an inﬂection point and the late time minimum at the desired positions.
This can be done by scanning over ﬂux parameters, intersections numbers and gauge
groups so that the following constraints are satisﬁed:

• Inﬂection point

• Late time minimum

(6.49)

The ﬁrst two conditions produce an inﬂection point at Φip with the right slope to
yield a scalar spectral tilt around ns = 0.96, while the last two conditions imply the
existence of a Minkowski minimum at Φmin. These conditions are invariant under
a rescaling of V0 in (6.43) and (6.44) since it is just an overall multiplicative factor
in the scalar potential. V0 is instead ﬁxed by the requirement of obtaining the right
COBE normalization given by (6.14) which can also be rewritten as:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Φ=Φ∗

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Φ=Φip

(6.50)

Given the deﬁnition of V0 in (6.19), condition (5) can be seen as a constraint on the
magnitude of the ﬂux superpotential W0 which in Type IIB string compactiﬁcations
naturally lies in the range [0.1, 100]. We will show now how additional constraints
on Φip arise from combining this naturalness criterion with the requirement of low-
energy supersymmetry.
In fact we shall carefully choose Φip so that the COBE
normalization ﬁxes W0 in the natural range mentioned above. Fixing W0 through
the condition (5) sets also the energy scale of the soft-terms. Here we distinguish

207

between two possibilities:

• Non-sequestered models: If the cycle supporting the visible sector is stabilized

in geometric regime, the soft-terms are of order the gravitino mass:

Msoft (cid:39) m3/2 (cid:39)

W0Vmin

.

(6.51)

8π

This is usually referred to as the non-sequestered case which for W0 ∼ 1 leads
to TeV-scale supersymmetry only for values of the volume as large as V ∼ 1014.
This is possible for the two moduli case where the value of the visible sector
coupling does not depend on V. In the single modulus case, since α−1
vis = V 2/3,
the volume has to be of order 100, resulting necessarily in a high-scale SUSY
scenario.

• Sequestered models: If the visible sector modulus is ﬁxed in the singular regime,

the soft-terms can be very suppressed with respect to the gravitino mass:

(cid:114) gs

(cid:114) gs

8π

Msoft (cid:39) m3/2V (cid:39)

W0V 2

min

.

(6.52)

This is usually referred to as the sequestered scenario which for W0 ∼ 1 leads
to low-energy supersymmetry only for V ∼ 107. In these sequestered models
supersymmetry is broken in the bulk of the extra-dimensions while the visible
sector lives on branes localized at a singularity. Given that in this case the
visible sector coupling is set by the dilaton, this scenario can be realized both
in the single and in the two moduli case.

The magnitude of the ﬂux superpotential that satisﬁes condition (5) for a generic
inﬂection point Φip can be estimated by noting that at horizon exit  ∼ 10−10 and
√
there is a percent level cancellation between the three dominant terms. This implies
that at the inﬂection point V ∼ 0.01 V0 e−
27/2Φip, and so the Hubble scale can be
estimated as:

(6.55)

Assuming gs (cid:39) 0.1, we conclude that only inﬂection points in the range Φip ∈ [6, 10]
are compatible with natural values of W0.

We can take these simple estimates further and for each Φip obeying (6.55) ﬁnd
the position of the late time minimum Φmin that gives rise to TeV-scale soft masses in
both sequestered and non-sequestered scenarios. For the sequestered case we have:

which by using (6.55) becomes:

A similar estimate for the non-sequestered case yields:

Φmin (cid:39) 13.51 +

3
2

Φip .

(6.56)

(6.57)

(6.58)

Hence we see that the distance between the inﬂection point and the minimum in the
non-sequestered case is exactly twice the corresponding distance in the sequestered
setup. The factor of two descends directly from the extra volume suppression of
(6.52) when compared with (6.51).
In both cases the combination of the obser-
vational constraint on the amplitude of the density perturbations, the theoretical
bias on natural values of W0 and the requirement of TeV-scale soft-terms conspire to
ﬁx the distance between the inﬂationary inﬂection point and the late-time minimum.

Tables 6.1 and 6.2 illustrate some reference values obtained using (6.55) to ﬁx
the inﬂection point for diﬀerent values of W0, and then (6.58) and (6.57) to get the
late-time minimum in the non-sequestered (Tab. 6.1) and sequestered (Tab. 6.2)
scenarios respectively.

(6.53) we get H (cid:39) 1010 GeV which corresponds to an inﬂationary scale of order 1014
GeV. This result can also be obtained numerically using the more precise values
listed in the next section.

Let us comment on the consistency of our eﬀective ﬁeld theory approach. As
derived in [365], the superspace derivative expansion is under control if m3/2 (cid:28) MKK
which translates into the bound:

(cid:114) gs

δ ≡

W0V 1/3 (cid:28) 1 .

(6.59)

2

This bound is satisﬁed in each case of Tab. 6.1 and 6.2 both around the inﬂection
point and the late-time minimum. In fact, considering just the region around the
inﬂection point (V becomes larger around the minimum and so this bound is stronger
during inﬂation) and setting gs = 0.1, we have: δ (cid:39) 10−3 for W0 = 0.1, δ (cid:39) 10−2 for
W0 = 1, δ (cid:39) 5 · 10−2 for W0 = 10 and δ (cid:39) 0.1 for W0 = 100. Thus the superspace
derivative expansion is under control, and so higher derivative α(cid:48)-corrections should

210

naturally be suppressed. Therefore, as we shall show in the next section, we have
to tune the coeﬃcient of the F 4 α(cid:48) terms (6.26) and (6.33) to large values. However
the fact that the expansion parameter δ turns out to be small, allows us to neglect
further higher derivative corrections in a consistent way.

6.4.2 Numerical Results

In this section we present a detailed numerical study of inﬂection point volume
inﬂation. We start by focusing on the non-sequestered single modulus case with
high-scale SUSY. In this case the late-time minimum is bound to be of order 100, so
that the evolution of the canonically normalized ﬁeld Φ is very limited. Nevertheless,
as shown in Fig. 6.1, it is possible to get an inﬂection point and a late-time minimum
at the desired values. The scalar potential is plotted in Fig. 6.1. We require Φip = 3.5
and Φmin = 4.2, corresponding respectively to values of the volume Vip (cid:39) 72 and
Vmin (cid:39) 171. These values are clearly too small to trust the eﬀective ﬁeld theory
approach. However we shall still present the numerical results for this case for
illustrative purposes, and shall focus later on cases with low-energy supersymmetry
where the volume during and after inﬂation is larger and the supergravity eﬀective
theory is under much better control.

Figure 6.1: Scalar potential obtained requiring Φip = 3.5 and Φmin = 4.2 in the single
modulus case with the visible sector on D7-branes wrapping the volume cycle.

In this example it is possible to reproduce the correct value of the spectral index,
as a consequence of the condition (6.47). We list in Tab. 6.3 the numerical results
obtained for diﬀerent positions of the inﬂection point and the late-time minimum
for which we get always ns (cid:39) 0.96.

∆Φ is the ﬁeld excursion of the canonically normalized volume modulus Φ be-
tween horizon exit and the end of inﬂation. Since ∆Φ ∼ 0.1MP we are clearly
dealing with a small ﬁeld inﬂationary model. Thus the tensor-to-scalar ratio is of
order r (cid:39) 10−10. The values of W0 reported in Tab. 6.3 are the numerical results
which satisfy the COBE normalization. The corresponding Hubble scale in each
case is H (cid:39) 109 GeV which translates into an inﬂationary scale around 1014 GeV.

We now turn to study the two more interesting sequestered and non-sequestered
cases with larger values of the volume and TeV-scale supersymmetry. Since in both
cases the shape of the scalar potential is always qualitatively the same around the
inﬂection point and the late-time minimum, we plot it in Fig. 6.2 just for the non-
sequestered case.

The numerical results listed below are obtained requiring that the inﬂection point
and the late-time minimum are those given in Tab. 6.1 and 6.2 where we required
natural values of W0 and low-energy supersymmetry in both non-sequestered and

212

sequestered cases. The tensor-to-scalar ratio turns out to be always of order r (cid:39)
10−9. In the following tables the only inputs are Φip and Φmin, while W0, κgs, κF 4
), κhid, κD3 and κnp are the numerical outputs obtained by solving (6.46)
(or κF 4
and (6.49). As a consequence of the condition (6.47), the value of the spectral index
is ns (cid:39) 0.967 in each of the cases listed below.

Table 6.7: Numerical results for the coeﬃcients of the scalar potential in the se-
questered two moduli case with TeV-scale supersymmetry.

Two important observations can be inferred from the values of the coeﬃcients
listed in Tab. 6.1 and 6.5. The ﬁrst one is that κgs is always required to be
negative. In our models the negative sign can be obtained by the interplay of
the two terms in (6.35). Moreover the presence of the inﬂection point is highly
sensitive to small variations of the coeﬃcients in Tab. 6.4, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7.
Thus in order to accurately reproduce the shape of the scalar potential in each
case, it is necessary to tune the coeﬃcients to a much higher level of precision
than that reported in the Tables.

6.5 Two Fields Dynamics

Up to this point we have dealt exclusively with the single ﬁeld limit, implicitly as-
suming that all other moduli, like the axio-dilaton, the complex structure moduli
and additional Kähler moduli, are heavier than the Hubble scale during inﬂation.

214

While this may be arranged for in the single Kähler modulus case, it is certainly
not true for the model constructed within the LVS framework. In this section we
comment on various aspects of the two ﬁeld dynamics of this model.

As shown in Sec. 6.3, the eﬀective single ﬁeld potential of (6.44) is obtained after
integrating out the small blow-up modulus τs. This procedure is valid in the vicinity
of the LVS minimum where there is a clear mass hierarchy:

(6.60)

(cid:28)
however it fails around the inﬂection point where both ﬁelds are very light m2

Fig. 6.3.

(b) Large volume region.

Figure 6.3: Scalar potential (6.44) in the inﬂationary region, around the tuned point
(τb, τs)|ip = (1000, 20) and in the large volume region (τb, τs)|min = (2.4 × 109, 16.4).

Due to the ﬂatness of the scalar potential along both directions, the correct way
to analyze the system is by numerically solving the background ﬁeld equations as
done in the original work [354]. Here we will extend the aforementioned analysis by
studying the sensitivity to the choice of initial conditions in a given potential and
by clarifying to what extent the single ﬁeld results constitute a valid approximation
to the inﬂationary observables. The reader looking for more details of the setup is
referred to [354] as we will focus only on the results obtained.

We proceed in the same spirit of the single ﬁeld analysis by choosing the coeﬃ-
cients that induce an inﬂection point along the volume direction. For concreteness
we choose (τb, τs)|ip = (1000, 20). We then consider a set of initial conditions around
that point and numerically solve the equations of motion. In Fig. 6.5 we plot the
solutions for the diﬀerent choices of initial positions for the system. We assume

215

throughout that the ﬁelds are released with vanishing velocities and ﬁnd that the
sensitivity to the initial position, that is characteristic of inﬂection point models,
is magniﬁed in the two ﬁeld setup as perturbing the initial conditions by a small
amount can lead to drastically diﬀerent outcomes. Starting uphill from the inﬂection
point tends to lead to trajectories that produce insuﬃcient expansion. In some cases,
, some of these trajectories can lead to the collapse
depending on the ratio τ ip
of the compact manifold to vanishing volume. For trajectories that start downhill
from the tuned point, it is easier to obtain a viable post inﬂationary evolution, with
the system evolving towards the LVS minimum, but the number of e-foldings de-
creases drastically with the distance from the tuned point. One is therefore led to
the conclusion that viable inﬂationary trajectories are obtained only in a narrow
region around τ ip

b and τs (cid:38) τ ip

marked by the star. Blue (thicker) trajectories correspond to those evolving towards
the post-inﬂationary large volume minimum, while the magenta (thinner) end with
a collapsing volume modulus. Right: Magniﬁcation around the initial points. The
numbers denote the total number of slow-roll e-foldings for each trajectory.

In what concerns inﬂationary observables in the two ﬁeld setup one expects the
projection along the inﬂationary trajectory (and hence the single ﬁeld estimates of
Sec. 6.4) to be a good approximation to the full result. This follows directly from
the fact that the observable portion of the trajectories yielding Ne ≥ 60, is rather
straight, as can be seen by the smallness of the inverse curvature radius plotted in
Fig. 6.5. This implies that curvature and isocurvature perturbations are essentially
decoupled and that a straightforward generalization of the single ﬁeld case leads to

216

an accurate estimate of the cosmological observables.3

6.6 Conclusions

It has long been acknowledged that there is severe tension between having simul-
taneously low-scale supersymmetry and high scale inﬂation in supergravity models.
This is due to the fact that the inﬂationary energy density contributes to the moduli
potential and will in generally tend to destabilize them.

Several mechanisms to decrease or eliminate this tension have been proposed over
the years and in this thesis we further develop the proposal of [354]. This particu-
lar model solves the tension between TeV-scale supersymmetry and the inﬂationary
scale by having an evolving compactiﬁcation volume between the inﬂationary epoch
and today.
Inﬂation is due to an inﬂection point in the volume direction of the
scalar potential which also possesses a minimum at large volume where the modulus
is supposed to sit at late-time after inﬂation. In order to prevent overshooting it is
necessary to require that a small amount of radiation is generated after the end of
inﬂation. The presence of this additional radiation is well justiﬁed in the two ﬁeld
model since it could be produced by the oscillations of the heavy modulus around
its minimum while in the single ﬁeld model particle production could be induced by
a changing vacuum state between the end of inﬂation and today.

3For thorough discussion of this issue in the context of a local string inﬂation model see [366].

217

In this chapter we described a possible microscopic origin of the inﬂationary
scalar potential that allows the gravitino mass to vary after the end of inﬂation and
at the same time features a late-time dS minimum. In particular, we provided an
explicit construction where the inﬂationary inﬂection point is generated by the inter-
play between string loops and higher derivative α(cid:48)-corrections to the scalar potential.
Moreover, we supplemented the LVS construction with a new model that involves
only one Kähler modulus. While in the LVS two moduli model non-perturbative ef-
fects play a crucial rôle in determining the presence of both the inﬂection point and
the late-time minimum, in the single modulus model non-perturbative eﬀects are
absent and an additional contribution arising from the F-terms of charged hidden
matter is needed. For both models we analyzed the relation between the value of
the volume during inﬂation and at present with the size of the ﬂux superpotential
W0. We found that if W0 takes natural values, the distance between the inﬂection
point and the late-time minimum is ﬁxed.

We ﬁnally studied the full dynamics of the two ﬁeld system in the LVS model and
showed that, after tuning the potential such that it features the desired inﬂection
point, there is a signiﬁcant sensitivity to the choice of initial conditions. Perturbing
the starting positions of the ﬁelds even by a small amount can lead to a radically
diﬀerent cosmological evolution. We also showed that, despite the presence of two
dynamical ﬁelds, the predictions for the cosmological observables derived in the
single ﬁeld case are accurate since the ﬁeld space trajectories are essentially straight
over the last 60 e-foldings of expansion.

Summary and ﬁnal remarks

Let us conclude by providing a brief summary of the contents and of the results
reported in this thesis.

In Chap. 1 we ﬁrst presented a brief report of the current status of particle physics
and cosmology. We also presented a quick overview of the possible alternatives for
the physics beyond the Standard Model, focusing specially on supersymmetric the-
ories.
In the second part of the same chapter we presented string theory as the
best candidate for a uniﬁed theory of all interactions, which describes also gravity
at the quantum level in a consistent way. After having described its main features,
we discussed the role of string phenomenology in the current search for new physics
beyond the Standard Model.

In Chap. 2 we presented an overview of the generic tools needed for the study of
string compactiﬁcations. More in detail, in the ﬁrst part we have shown that some
phenomenological requirements along with our poor computational skills restrict
the choice of the compact space to a very speciﬁc class, among the inﬁnity that are
available. We have also summarized how to get a N = 1 supersymmetric eﬀective
ﬁeld theory starting from the ten-dimensional action for massless string states. In
general such an eﬀective theory features the presence of many massless scalar ﬁelds,
which are problematic from a phenomenological point of view. In the second part
of the chapter we have shown how to connect this eﬀective ﬁeld theory with the real
world. The main step is represented by moduli stabilization, which makes moduli
massive and generally breaks supersymmetry. We used one of the most powerful
techniques for moduli stabilization, which is called Large Volume Scenario. Finally
we have described how to embed a chiral gauge theory using a stack of D3-branes on
top of a singularity of the compact space. In the last part of the section we presented

221

an explicit example of a string compactiﬁcation in which the visible sector is con-
sistently embedded in a global construction, and all the closed moduli are stabilized.

In Chap. 3 we have computed the soft spectrum arising from sequestered com-
patiﬁcations [1]. We have shown that it is possible to get a MSSM-like spectrum
only in a particular case in which the eﬀective ﬁeld theory is protected by an eﬀective
symmetry. In this case all the soft-terms have the same size, and they can be around
1 TeV without causing the cosmological moduli problem. In more generic situations
the spectrum exhibits a hierarchy between gaugino masses and scalar masses, giv-
ing rise to Split-SUSY scenarios with gauginos around the TeV and scalars around
106−107 GeV. This is an interesting example of how string theory can act as a guid-
ance among the myriads of beyond the Standard Model alternatives: Split-SUSY
scenarios seem to be quite more natural than MSSM ones from a top-down perspec-
tive.

A model-independent feature of the sequestered models presented in Chap. 3 is
that the ﬁeld whose VEV parametrizes the size of the compact extra-dimensions
(volume modulus) is always the lightest modulus. Due to its gravitational coupling
the volume modulus decays late in the history of the universe and can modify signif-
icantly its cosmological evolution. In particular, if it decays after the freeze-out of
thermally produced dark matter, it dilutes the previous abundance and produces a
new amount of dark matter. In Chap. 4 we performed a numerical study of the non-
thermal dark matter production in the MSSM case of Chap. 3 and we contrasted
the results with the current experimental bounds [2]. In the region of the param-
eter space which is not ruled out by experimental data, non-thermally produced
dark matter saturates the observed relic abundance if the lightest supersymmetric
particle is a higgsino-like neutralino with mass around 300 GeV and the reheating
temperature is about 2 GeV.

Relativistic degrees of freedom in the hidden sector constitute the so-called dark
radiation. The amount of dark radiation present in the universe can be constrained
by CMB and BBN experiments, since the presence of additional relativistic degrees
of freedom modiﬁes the rate of expansion of the universe at early times. The exis-
tence of dark radiation is then a very promising window on beyond the Standard
Model physics, and it is very interesting also from a string phenomenology point
of view. Indeed, it provides a quite model-independent signature of string models,
given that its existence is uniquely due to the presence of both hidden relativis-

222

tic degrees of freedom and moduli, which are the four-dimensional manifestation
of extra-dimensions. Hence it can be used either to rule out or to constrain entire
classes of string compactiﬁcations. A generic feature of sequestered models is that
the volume modulus decays into a massless axion-like ﬁeld, which acts as dark ra-
diation. In Chap. 5 we have shown that in Split-SUSY scenarios the dark radiation
produced in sequestered models is within the current experimental bounds, provided
that the decay of the volume modulus into scalars is kinematically allowed [4].

In Chap. 6 we studied the microscopic origin of a model of inﬂation in which the
role of the inﬂaton is played by the volume modulus, called Volume Inﬂation [3].
This is a particularly interesting model because it provides a dynamical mechanism
to overcome the well known tension between TeV soft-terms and high-scale inﬂation.
It turns out that inﬂation is due to the interplay of quantum corrections to the scalar
potential (both α(cid:48) and string loop corrections) with contributions from anti-branes
and/or from charged hidden matter. They give rise to an inﬂection point around
which small-ﬁeld inﬂation can take place. We have shown that requiring natural
values for the parameters of the model and TeV scale soft-terms leads to a well de-
ﬁned relation between the value of the volume during inﬂation and its value in the
late-time vacuum.

In general, the major open question is to exactly reproduce the Standard Model
at low-energy from a class of string compactiﬁcations and to reconcile it with cosmo-
logical observations. This problem can be faced in vastly diﬀerent ways depending
on the desired pattern of supersymmetric particles, and hopefully in the near future
new experimental data will help us in this task. In the present thesis we have ob-
served that it is very hard to get a TeV MSSM spectrum (which could address the
hierarchy problem) even in the most favored case in which the visible sector is placed
on top of D3-branes at singularities. Hopefully in the near future we will understand
whether it is actually worth addressing this problem or we should change our point
of view on the naturalness issues.
