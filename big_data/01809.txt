Abstract. We determine mass of MAXI J1659-152 using two diﬀerent
methods, viz:constant Normalization parameter point of view while ﬁtting
2
red variation from TCAF ﬁts. We ﬁnd a mass range of
with TCAF, MBH-χ
4.06 − 7.93 M⊙ with a most probable value at 6 ± 2M⊙.

1. Introduction

MAXI J1659-152 was ﬁrst observed by MAXI/GSC instrument on 24th Sept.
2010 at the sky location of R.A. = 16h59m10s, Dec = −15◦16′05′′ (Negoro et al.,
2010). It showed its very ﬁrst outburst in 2010, other than low-level activity in 2011
which continued for ∼ 9 months. The most acceptable ranges of distance and disk
inclination angle are 5.3 − 8.6 kpc and 60 − 80 deg. (Yamaoka et al. 2012 & Kuulkers
et al. 2013) respectively. Mass of the black hole candidate is estimated to be in the
range 3.6 − 8 M⊙ (Yamaoka et al. 2012), 2.2 − 3.1 M⊙ (Kenna et al. 2011), 20 ± 3 M⊙
(Shaposhnikov et al. 2011).

2. Results and Concluding remarks

In Fig. 1a we see that the value of normalization parameter (61.94-86.71) remains
at about a constant value (=70) throughout the outburst as it should be. During the
2 keeping Normalization roughly
ﬁtting we tried to ﬁt data with acceptable reduced χ
constant. This leads to a narrow range of possible mass of the black hole. During ﬁttng

remains good in between mass range 4.06M⊙-7.87M⊙ beyond which value of reduced χ

if we keep our all parameters to be free and maintain the normalization parameter to
be constant, we ﬁnd mass of black hole in the range of 5.14-7.93M⊙. In the second
method, we ﬁt 30 observation Ids with TCAF (Chakrabarti & Titarchuk., 1995) model
after the inclusion in XSPEC (Debnath et. al. 2014). During ﬁtting we keep all the
parameter free. After achieving the best ﬁt (for details, see, Debnath et. al. 2015)
we freeze all the parameter except the mass of black hole and tried to ﬁnd the range
2 is acceptable (<2). In Fig. 1(b-c) we see
of mass within which, value of reduced χ
2 behaves well within a mass range of 4.06-7.87M⊙. So, from
that value of reduced χ
2
red behaviour we can bracket the mass of black hole within mass
variation of MBH-χ
range of 4.06-7.87M⊙. Combining the results of these two diﬀerent types of estimates
we obtain a single set of bounds for the mass. The most probable mass of black hole
candidate MAXI J1659-152 appears to be 6 ± 2 M⊙.
