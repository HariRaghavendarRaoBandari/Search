When running time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations for real-time simu-
lations of non-equilibrium dynamics, the user has a choice of initial Kohn-Sham state, and typically a
Slater determinant is used. We explore the impact of this choice on the exchange-correlation potential
when the physical system begins in a 50:50 superposition of the ground and ﬁrst-excited state of the
system. We investigate the possibility of judiciously choosing a Kohn-Sham initial state that mini-
mizes errors when adiabatic functionals are used. We ﬁnd that if the Kohn-Sham state is chosen to
have a conﬁguration matching the one that dominates the interacting state, this can be achieved for a
ﬁnite time duration for some but not all such choices. When the Kohn-Sham system does not begin
in a Slater determinant, we further argue that the conventional splitting of the exchange-correlation
potential into exchange and correlation parts has limited value, and instead propose a decomposi-
tion into a “single-particle” contribution that we denote vS
XC, and a remainder. The single-particle
contribution can be readily computed as an explicit orbital-functional, reduces to exchange in the
Slater determinant case, and offers an alternative to the adiabatic approximation as a starting point
for TDDFT approximations.

Theory
(TDDFT)
is increasingly being used beyond
linear
to study fully non-
equilibrium dynamics of electronic systems in real-time.
Although TDDFT has had much success in the linear
response regime in calculations of spectra, it is perhaps
a more enticing tool for real-time dynamics when the
system is driven far from its ground-state, because
of the computational challenges in describing such
dynamics for more than two electrons with alternative
wavefunction-based methods.
TDDFT presents an
attractive possibility due to its system-size scaling,
arising from its description of the dynamics in terms
of a non-interacting system of electrons evolving in a
single-particle potential.
In practise the many-body
effects hidden in this potential, termed the exchange-
correlation (xc) potential, must be approximated. The
Runge-Gross and the van Leeuwen [4] theorems reas-
sure us that there exists an exact xc potential for which
the time-dependent one-body density of the interacting
system is exactly predicted.
It is therefore of much
interest what the features of this exact xc potential look
like in order to develop approximations that build in
these features.

The exact xc potential at a given time t is known
to depend on the density not just at time t but also
on its history, and it additionally depends on the
initial wavefunction of the physical system Ψ(0), as
well as the choice of initial Kohn-Sham wavefunction
Φ(0): vXC[n; Ψ(0), Φ(0)]. Typically however, in real-
time TDDFT simulations adiabatic approximations are
used which depend only on the instantaneous density:

XC[n; Ψ(0), Φ(0)] = vg.s.
XC [n(t)]. That is, they insert the
vA
instantaneous density into a ground-state approxima-
tion. This approximation has provided useful results for
the interpretation and prediction of electron-dynamics
in a range of situations,
including photovoltaic de-
sign [5], high-harmonic generation in molecules [6], co-
herent phonon generation [7], ultrafast demagnetization
of solids [8]. However, in some cases there are com-
plete failures, e.g. Refs. [9–11], and studies on model
systems have revealed that there are large non-adiabatic
features in the exact xc potential that are missing in the
approximations. These include step and peak features
that evolve in time [12–18]. These dynamical features
appear generically when the system has been pushed
out of equilibrium, whether or not there is an external
ﬁeld present. They have been analyzed in terms of the
local acceleration across the system [15] and in terms
of a decomposition into kinetic and interaction xc com-
ponents [17]. The latter generalizes a concept from the
ground-state that was pioneered by Evert Jan Baerends
and his group [19–22], which had provided valuable in-
sight into analyzing the structure of the ground-state xc
potential in atoms and molecules.

In this paper, we will focus on the initial-state de-
pendence of these non-adiabatic features, and on the xc
potential in general. The initial interacting state Ψ(0)
is given by the problem at hand, but one has a choice
of initial Kohn-Sham state Φ(0) in which to begin the
non-interacting Kohn-Sham evolution. The only restric-
tion is that Φ(0) must have the same initial density and
ﬁrst time-derivative of the density as that of Ψ(0). Al-
most always, an initial single Slater determinant (SSD)
of orbitals is chosen, even when the initial interacting
state is far from an SSD. For example, in simulating

photo-induced dynamics, where the true state is a sin-
glet single excitation of the molecule, a typical prac-
tise is simply to raise one electron from the Kohn-Sham
HOMO and place it in a virtual orbital; spin-adaptation
is done after the dynamics is run. The true initial state
on the other hand requires at least two Slater determi-
nants for a minimal description. The exact xc potential
for model systems with different choices of initial Kohn-
Sham states can vary signiﬁcantly, and so the question
arises: Is there an optimal choice of Kohn-Sham initial
state, for which the exact xc potential has minimal non-
adiabatic features, such that propagating this state using
an adiabatic functional yields the smallest errors?

Preliminary investigations considered initial station-
ary excited states, and suggested the “best” Kohn-
Sham initial state when using an adiabatic approxima-
tion has a conﬁguration similar to the initial interact-
ing state [23]. That work was limited to studying the
exact xc potentials compared with the adiabatic ones at
the initial time, while time-propagation was considered
only using common adiabatic approximations, since to
ﬁnd the exact xc potential for a Kohn-Sham state that
has more than one occupied orbital is very demanding.
Refs. [24, 25], on the other hand, used the recently in-
troduced global ﬁxed-point iteration method [24–29] to
ﬁnd the exact xc potential in time for different choices of
Kohn-Sham initial state for a given density of two parti-
cles interacting via a cosine interaction on a ring.

In this paper we go further, returning to the more
physical soft-Coulomb interaction used in Ref. [23], and
investigate the exact xc potential for different choices
of Kohn-Sham initial states as a function of time us-
ing the iteration procedure of Ref. [24, 25], for ﬁeld-free
dynamics of a superposition state. We compare with
the adiabatically-exact (AE) approximation, which is de-
ﬁned as the exact ground-state xc potential evaluated
on the exact density [30]. This is the best possible adia-
batic approximation, and is what the intensive efforts in
building increasingly sophisticated approximations for
ground-state problems strive towards. We ﬁnd that al-
though the AE approximation is a better approximation
for some choices of Kohn-Sham initial state than others,
at least for short times, it is not particularly good for
any of them for the strongly non-equilibrium dynam-
ics considered here. We expect therefore the AE prop-
agation to be inaccurate.
Instead we introduce a dif-
ferent starting point for TDDFT approximations, based
on the time-dependent xc hole of the Kohn-Sham wave-
function. This is motivated by the decomposition of
Refs. [17, 31], where the Kohn-Sham wavefunction is
used to evaluate the interaction term, and yields an ex-
plicit orbital functional. We denote this approximation
XC, and it contains some non-adiabatic contributions.
vS
The exact xc potential is decomposed as vXC = vS
XC,
XC +vNS
which we propose as the basis for a new approximation
strategy which is particularly promising in the case of
initial Kohn-Sham states that resemble the initial inter-
acting state, going beyond the usual Kohn-Sham SSD.

II. MODEL SYSTEM AND DIFFERENT INITIAL STATES

The soft-Coulomb interaction [32] has been used ex-
tensively in strong-ﬁeld physics as well as in density-
functional theory as it captures much of the physics
of real atoms and molecules. The particular Hamil-
tonian we choose represents a model of the Helium
atom prepared in a superposition state. We place two
soft-Coulomb interacting electrons in a one-dimensional
(1D) soft-Coulomb well (atomic units are used through-
out),

a box with inﬁnite walls at x = ±L/2 = 7.5au, giving
zero boundary conditions at ±L/2.

A. Different choices of initial Kohn-Sham state

We will study the features of the exact xc potential
evaluated at this many-body density when different ini-
tial Kohn-Sham states are propagated. First, we deﬁne

and zero current-density as Ψ(0). We will consider dif-
ferent values for a, focussing particularly on:

= (cid:112)n(x, 0)/2. This is the conventional choice

(i) Φ(0) = Φa=0. By requiring the initial density
and zero current-density match, we immediately obtain
φa=0
0
for TDDFT, an SSD. The exact xc potential in this case,
vXC[n; Ψ(0), Φa=0] was studied before for this problem in
Refs. [15, 17], and large non-adiabatic step and peak fea-
tures were observed. They are missing in all adiabatic
approximations, and even the exact ground-state xc po-
tential i.e. the AE, looks completely different than the
exact. A point of the present paper is to explore whether
a different choice of initial Kohn-Sham state can reduce
these non-adiabatic features.

(ii) Φ(0) = Φa=1, which is a non-interacting analog of
the form of the true interacting state. Unlike in case (i),
there are many possible pairs of orbitals with this form
that reproduce a given density and current-density. The
reason is that here we do not consider a ground state
and hence do not have the Hohenberg-Kohn uniqueness
theorem. Our choice here has a relatively large overlap
with the interacting state. See also (iii).

(iii) Φ(0) = (cid:101)Φa=1, has the same form of (ii) but with

a different pair of orbitals that are eigenstates of quite a
different potential, and with a signiﬁcantly smaller over-
lap with the true interacting state.

(iv) Φ(0) = Ψ(0); the initial Kohn-Sham state is chosen

identical to the initial interacting state.

In addition to the four states above, we will also show
some results for other a but will not study these situa-
tions in so much detail.

In Figure 1, we plot the orbitals of these states, and
the potentials in which they are eigenstates. While in the
case a = 0 we know the form of the initial Kohn-Sham
orbitals and the corresponding Kohn-Sham potential an-
alytically as a density-functional,

approximate functionals, in particular, adiabatic ones
that depend only on the instantaneous density, approx-
imate the exact xc potential gives an indication of how
accurately the approximate functional reproduces the
density. Since adiabatic functionals neglect all initial-
state dependence (and dependence on the density’s
history), then when evaluated on a given density, it
gives the same potential for any of the choices of the
Kohn-Sham initial state, unlike the exact xc potential.

In the next section we explain how we ﬁnd the ex-
act xc potential for a given choice of initial Kohn-Sham
state.

GLOBAL FIXED-POINT METHOD

To ﬁnd the exact xc potential for a given physical
density evolution is generally a non-trivial task. One
must effectively ﬁnd a one-body potential in which non-
interacting electrons evolve yielding the exact physi-
cal density of the interacting system at each instant
in time; even whether, or when, such a potential ex-
ists is not a completely closed question [29]. The non-
adiabatic step and peak features that have been high-
lighted in Refs. [15–17] involve a particularly simple
case: two electrons in 1D, where the Kohn-Sham ini-
tial state is taken to be a doubly-occupied orbital (as
in (i) in the previous section), that evolves as φ(x, t) =
|φ(x, t)|eiα(x,t). The amplitude of this orbital is ﬁxed
from requiring the instantaneous density is reproduced,
n(x, t) = 2|φ(x, t)|2, while its phase follows from use of
the continuity equation in 1D: ∂tn(x, t) = −∂xj where
j is the one-body current, j(x, t) = n(x, t)∂xα(x, t).
Thus the exact Kohn-Sham orbital can be readily recon-
structed from knowledge of n(x, t), and the Kohn-Sham
equation inverted to ﬁnd the Kohn-Sham potential; sub-
tracting the external and Hartree potentials yields the
exact xc potential. Despite the simple procedure (see
also [34] for the periodic case), the resulting xc potential
displays a wealth of interesting non-adiabatic features,
absent in ground-state potentials. For more electrons
and more dimensions, a numerical iteration scheme is
required instead, and has been performed for quasi-
particle propagation in a model one-dimensional 20-
electron nano-wire [12] and for two electrons along a
two-dimensional ring[25]. Sometimes lattice models can
soothe the computational cost [35–38].

momentum-stress forces ˆQS(x) = −i[ˆj(x), ˆT ] [39].
In
the case of the physical, interacting, system the inter-
nal force density also contains a contribution from the
interaction forces, i.e., ˆQ(x) = −i[ˆj(x), ˆT + ˆW ] [39]. If
we prescribe the density n(x, t) and ﬁx an initial Kohn-
Sham state Φ(0), then Eq. (9) becomes a non-linear equa-
tion for the external potential vS[n; Φ(0)](x, t) that repro-
duces n(x, t). The solution to this equation can then be
found by an iteration procedure of the form

In the case of zero bound-
ary conditions on the wave functions we then solve for
(x, t) by imposing that the potential needs to be
vk+1
even about the boundaries x = ±L/2 [24, 25, 29]. We
then iterate until convergence.
[The actual numerical
implementation uses a slightly different form of Eq. (10)
that also contains the current density and iterates for
each individual time step. In this way numerical errors
can be suppressed. For a detailed discussion of the algo-
rithm the reader is refered to [25]]. This then allows us
to determine the xc potential from

vXC[n; Ψ(0), Φ(0)] = vS[n; Φ(0)] − v − vH[n],

where v = −2/
x2 + 1 is explicitly given by the prob-
lem at hand.

tential that generates the prescribed density from Ψ(0)
in the interacting system, but we do not directly utilize
this functional dependence.)

A. Global Fixed Point Iteration Method

IV. RESULTS: THE EXACT TIME-DEPENDENT XC

POTENTIAL

Even for two electrons in 1D, the inversion to explore
different possibilities for Kohn-Sham initial states be-
comes non-trivial. As soon as more than one Kohn-
Sham orbital is involved, one must guarantee not only
that the time-dependent density is reproduced at each
instant in time from the sum-square of these orbitals,
but also that each orbital is evolving consistently in the
same one-body potential.
In this work, we utilize the
global ﬁxed point iteration method recently introduced
in Refs. [24–29] to ﬁnd the exact Kohn-Sham poten-
tial for the different choices of initial Kohn-Sham states.
This method uses the fundamental equation of TDDFT,
which is employed in the founding papers [3, 4] and de-
scribes the divergence of the local forces (here in 1D for
simplicity)

Ref.

[15] showed that

for the Kohn-Sham non-
interacting system to exactly reproduce the density dy-
namics of the 50:50 superposition state when an SSD
is used, the exact xc potential develops large step and
peak like features that are completely missed by any
adiabatic approximation, even the “best” adiabatic ap-
proximation, the AE. Can these features be reduced if
the Kohn-Sham system is allowed to go beyond an SSD?
In Figures 2 and 3 we show the exact xc potential
vXC[n; Ψ(0), Φ(0)](x, t) at various times for the different
choices of Kohn-Sham initial state detailed in Section II.
The SSD case, Φa=0 is shown in both plots as refer-
ence. The evolution of the xc potential for longer times
is shown in Figures 4, 5, and 6, for the KS initial state
choices a = 0, a = 1 and Φ(0) = Ψ(0) respectively.

We observe that the exact xc potential is hugely de-
pendent on the choice of initial state. The prominent
step feature at t = 0 seen when an SSD is used (a = 0),
which requires a non-adiabatic functional to be cap-
tured, can be signiﬁcantly reduced when other choices

at t = 12, in the middle region the step structure might
appear more similar for several different choices of ini-
tial Kohn-Sham state than at earlier times, at later times
they again become quite different, as clear in Figs 4, 5,
and 6.

ing initial state with non-interacting orbitals. The non-
adiabatic features are smaller at short times, although
still present, as can be seen by comparing with the AE
plotted over the ﬁrst period (since the density is peri-
odic, and the AE depends only on the instantaneous
density, the AE also just repeats over subsequent peri-
ods). For longer times though, the non-adiabatic fea-
tures can get large for Φa=1, where at t = 12 au, for ex-
ample, we see large oscillations in the tails and a step
feature about the same size as that of the SSD case.

ferent, (cid:104)Ψ(0)|Φa=0(0)(cid:105) = 0.9202 while (cid:104)Ψ(0)|(cid:101)Φa=1(0)(cid:105) =

region [15], which is not a priori obvious. These two KS
initial states have a very different nature, and their over-
laps with the initial interacting state are also very dif-

to (cid:104)Ψ(0)|Φa=0(0)(cid:105), yet the resulting xc potential at the
initial time is very different). At longer times, the po-
tentials do begin to differ signiﬁcantly though as ex-
pected. The large step in the potential for Φa=0 dynami-
cally oscillates in a periodic manner, while the potential

for(cid:101)Φa=1 gets rather unruly quite quickly. Note that the

periodicity of the density carries over to the potential
for the single-orbital case (Φ(0) = Φa=0) and the AE po-
tential, due to the fact that the single Kohn-Sham orbital
depends simply and directly only on the density and its
ﬁrst time-derivative (see Sec III). This is not the case for
the other Kohn-Sham initial states, and their periodic-
ity is more complicated. Another striking example can
be found in [24], where the Kohn-Sham potential for a
static density but with the interacting wave function as
initial Kohn-Sham state is considered. The Kohn-Sham
potential is strongly time-dependent since it needs to
keep the static form of the density despite the rapidly
changing (multi-determinantal) Kohn-Sham wave func-
tion.

Observations for the other few-determinant states The po-
tentials for the other few-determinant states in Fig. 3 all
have signiﬁcant step features at the initial time and de-
velop large oscillatory features quite quickly. The Φa=0.5
case remains relatively close to the SSD case on the scale
shown, while the xc potential for Φa=3 has large wells
and barriers throughout. The case of Φa=0.8 is the one
closest to the “best” few-determinant state Φa=1 shown
on the left for short times, but develops already a large
step after half a period.

large peak and the boundary at L/2 = 7.5 (see Fig. 1).
The occupied orbital of va=0(x) (see upper left ﬁgure in
Fig. 1) is bound but with an energy lying close to the
small barrier on its right, giving it a large tunneling tail.
On the other hand, va=1(x) binds its lowest orbital more
tightly to the position of its well, deeper than the cases

of va=0(x) and(cid:101)va=1. Yet, these states all have the same

one-particle density (Eq. 3). Returning now to the xc po-
tential that keeps the states evolving with the same den-
sity at the initial time, Fig. 2 top panel, we observe that
the step feature on the left-hand-side is also very simi-

Observations for Φ(0) = Ψ(0) The choice of the (many-
determinant) state Φ(0) = Ψ(0) yields a potential strik-
ingly smaller than all the other potentials at t = 0, which
is very close to the AE potential. After already half a
period however, the potential, grows for this case too,
along with steps and peaks. Note that the oscillations
seen after half a period are a feature of our system, and
not numerical artifacts; they are converged with respect
to numerical parameters.

At this point we wish to stress that it is not that we
necessarily are striving to ﬁnd the smallest xc potential;
rather, we are trying to ﬁnd one with either the smallest
non-adiabatic features such that the usual adiabatic ap-
proximations would work best, or that is in some other
way somehow amenable to practical approximations.
Of course, the latter is not a very clearly-deﬁned goal,
however we discuss a few approaches in the next sec-
tion. For now, regarding the AE approximation, we see
that it is a very poor approximation for most the choices
of initial state we have studied, the exception being the
case Φ(0) = Ψ(0) at very short times (within a quarter
of a period). We will in fact ﬁnd an even better approx-
imation to the potential for Φ(0) = Ψ(0) for very short
times in the next section.

V. DECOMPOSITIONS AND APPROXIMATIONS OF

THE XC POTENTIAL

Often when considering approximations, it is natural
to decompose the exact xc potential into parts that could
be treated at different levels of approximation. We will
discuss here four different types of decompositions.

Exchange and Correlation The ﬁrst is the common de-
composition into exchange and correlation, as has been
traditionally done in ground-state density functional
theory (DFT) and electronic structure theory in general.
Exchange implies interaction effects beyond Hartree
that account only for the Pauli exclusion principle; it
arises very naturally therefore in any theory that uti-
lizes an SSD reference, since an SSD takes care of the
antisymmetry but does not introduce any other inter-
action effects. For example, the ground-state DFT (or
Hartree-Fock) exchange energy is deﬁned exactly as the
expectation value of the electron-electron operator in the
Kohn-Sham (or Hartree-Fock) SSD minus the Hartree
energy. This decomposition has affected the devel-
opment of functional approximations. The exchange
energy is known exactly, is self-interaction-free, and
dominates over correlation for atomic and molecular
ground-states at equilibrium geometries. Because of
this, some developers argue the exact exchange energy
should be used [40], while others [41] make the case that
exchange and correlation should be approximated to-
gether to make use of error cancellation, especially for
the electron-pair bond in molecules where correlation
becomes large. Now, in the time-dependent theory a
new element arises: the possibility of using Kohn-Sham

7

states that are not SSDs throws into question the rele-
vance of this separation into exchange and correlation.
If we were to deﬁne exchange via interaction effects be-
yond Hartree introduced by considering the interaction
operator on a Kohn-Sham state that is not an SSD, then
clearly this includes more than just the effects from the
Pauli exclusion principle. If we preserve the meaning of
exchange as representing Pauli exclusion then, for two
electrons in a spin-singlet as we have, vX = −vH/2, in-
dependent of the choice of the initial Kohn-Sham state.
The exchange potential therefore for any two-electron
singlet dynamics is adiabatic and has the shape of a sim-
ple well “under” the density, with all the more interest-
ing structure seen in Figs 2 and 3 appearing in the corre-
lation potential.

Adiabatic and Non-Adiabatic The second decomposi-
tion we discuss is the usual one made in TDDFT: into
adiabatic (A) and non-adiabatic (NA) (also termed dy-
namical) components, deﬁned as

vXC[n; Ψ(0), Φ(0)] = vA

XC[n(t)]+vNA

XC [n; Ψ(0), Φ(0)] , (12)

where

vA
XC[n] = vg.s.

XC [n] = vg.s.

S

[n] − vg.s.[n] − vH[n].

(13)

S

If the exact ground-state xc potential is used in Eq. (13),
this deﬁnes the AE potential, which we plotted in Fig. 2
and discussed in previous section. In our speciﬁc case
we have given vg.s.
[n] explicitly in Eq. (7). For vg.s.[n] we
employed the iteration method outlined in appendix A.
In practise, most calculations in TDDFT use an adiabatic
XC = 0 and choosing one of the
approximation, setting vNA
myriad approximations developed for the ground-state
on the right-hand-side of Eq. (13). Given that the “best”
adiabatic approximation, the AE, is not close to the exact
xc potential for any of the choices of initial Kohn-Sham
state except at very short times for the Φ(0) = Ψ(0)
choice, it is unlikely that any adiabatic approximation
will propagate accurately for this dynamics.

Kinetic and Interaction A third decomposition is in
terms of kinetic and interaction components [4, 17, 31],
which has only recently been studied to understand bet-
ter the nature of the xc potential, in particular the non-
adiabatic step and peak features that appear in non-
equilibrium dynamics [15, 17]. A similar decomposition
was pioneered by Evert Jan Baerends and his group for
the ground-state case [19–22], where it provided an in-
sightful analysis of step and peak features in ground-
state potentials of atoms and molecules. The ground-
state xc potential is expressed in terms of kinetic, hole,
and response components. The kinetic and response
components display peak and step features in intershell
regions in atoms, bonding regions in molecules, becom-
ing especially prominent at large bond-lengths, where
they tend to be an indication of static correlation. In the
time-dependent case, we deﬁne the interaction (W) and
kinetic (T) terms

times. We see again that for the few-determinant states,
C dominates the potential at the initial time and at
vT
half period (t ∼ 6). For the choice Φ(0) = Ψ(0), vT
is identically zero at t = 0; the entire xc potential is
initially in the interaction term vW
XC, which is small.
At later times however, vT
C becomes large also for this
choice of KS initial state.

Single-particle and Remainder From the previous de-
composition, a natural question then arises: if we ap-
proximate vW
XC by inserting the instantaneous Kohn-
Sham xc hole on the right-hand-side of Eq (19), then
how well does it do? If we made the analogous approx-
imation to vT
C , approximating the true density-matrix
by the Kohn-Sham one, it would yield zero, so such an
approach would have to be used either if some other
approximation for vT
C was used in conjunction, or if
C itself is very small.
Indeed the latter occurs when

lution of the 50:50 superposition state with the chosen
Kohn-Sham initial states we are studying at present, al-

will be a poor approximation to vXC because of the dom-
inating vT
XC component, except for the case Ψ(0) = Φ(0)
where it will be very good at short times but likely not
good at longer times.

XC may be a reasonable approximation to vW

Figures 8 and 9 verify this. Figure 8 shows that vS
is an excellent approximation to vW
XC for the case Φ(0) =
Ψ(0), especially at earlier times. It is also not a bad ap-
proximation for the other initial state choices. Figure 9
compares then the approximation vS
XC to the full vXC for
the cases in which vT
C is the smallest, Φ(0) = Ψ(0) and
Φ(0) = Φa=1, along with the AE xc potential, and bears
out the expectations of the previous paragraph.

XC

The integrated nature of vW

XC (see Eq. 19) makes it
much more forgiving to approximate xc holes, than the
C is to the density-matrix; the high number of deriva-
vT
tives in Eq. 21 make vT

C very sensitive.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

Initial-state dependence is a subtle aspect of the exact
xc potential of TDDFT that has no precedent in ground-
state DFT. Here we have explored the possibility of ex-
ploiting it to ease the job of the xc functional, i.e. to in-
vestigate whether, for a given initial state of the inter-
acting problem, there is a “most suitable” Kohn-Sham
initial state to use such that features of the xc functional
are simpler to approximate. We note that most calcula-
tions today assume an SSD for the Kohn-Sham system,
but the theory has no such restriction. We have focussed
only on one case, ﬁeld-free evolution of a 50:50 super-
position of a ground and ﬁrst-excited state of a two-
electron problem. This is, arguably, one of the most dif-
ﬁcult cases for conventional approximations in TDDFT,
given the extreme non-equilibrium nature of the dy-
namics. At the same time, although the results here are
discussed speciﬁcally for this particular evolution, they
have consequences also for dynamics driven by external
ﬁelds when beginning in the ground state, since such
superpositions can be reached in the interacting system,
yet the Kohn-Sham state at all times is restricted to what-
ever conﬁguration it began in.

Earlier work had shown that if an SSD is chosen as
the Kohn-Sham state, large dynamical features, such as

onset of the dynamics. These are completely missed
by any adiabatic approximation and have a dependence
on the density that is non-local in space and time.
It
has remained so far a challenge to derive approximate
density-functionals with memory that incorporate these
features, and so adds much motivation to the comple-
mentary path we investigate here, whether one can ex-
ploit initial-state dependence to reduce their size.

We have found that if the Kohn-Sham state is chosen
to also have the form of a 50:50 superposition state, then
one can ﬁnd such a state for which the non-adiabatic
step and peak features are small at short times. But
at longer times (in our case, within one period of the
dynamics), the non-adiabatic features can get large, as
large as the SSD choice. However simply having the
right conﬁguration is not enough; other initial states
with this conﬁguration can be found for which the non-
adiabatic features are again large even at short times.
Having said that, perhaps there is another Kohn-Sham
state of this form that we just did not ﬁnd, that has ac-
tually smaller non-adiabatic features. If we instead con-
sider the correlated many-body interacting state as the
initial Kohn-Sham state, then we ﬁnd that at very short
times, the adiabatic approximation becomes a very ac-
curate approximation to the xc potential, however even
after half a period, dynamical step and peak features
reappear that are larger than the best few-determinant
choice. We can conclude that for very short times, the
choice of Φ(0) = Ψ(0) is best if one must use an adiabatic
approximation, while at longer but still short times (on
the time-scale of the dynamics), a judicious choice of a
Kohn-Sham initial state with the same conﬁguration as
the interacting state is likely a better choice. This partic-
ular conclusion is not universally true, e.g. if the initial
interacting state is a ground state, then the adiabatic ap-
proximation works best at short times if the Kohn-Sham
state is a non-interacting ground-state, and the AE be-
comes then exact at the initial time [23].

We propose a new direction for developing approx-
imations for the xc potential in cases where the Kohn-
Sham state is chosen generally (i.e. not restricted to an
SSD). This is based on decomposing the exact expression
for the xc potential arising from the force-balance equa-
tion of TDDFT into a single-particle component and the
remainder. One can express the exact xc potential as
two contributions, one is a kinetic term, and the other is
an interaction term. The single-particle component, vS
has only terms arising from the interaction, but evalu-
ated using the Kohn-Sham xc hole; it reduces therefore
to exchange in the SSD limit, but in the general case, in-
cludes correlation components too. It is straightforward
to compute as an orbital functional, and we found that,
for initial Kohn-Sham states judiciously chosen as dis-
cussed above, it gives an extremely good approximation
to the exact interaction term, and a very good approxi-
mation to the full xc potential for short times. At longer
times, the kinetic term becomes important and vS
XC be-

XC

comes inaccurate. Future work involves focussing then
on developing new approximations for the kinetic com-
ponent of the xc potential while utilizing vS
XC for the in-
teraction component.

Appendix A: Finding adiabatic potentials and eigenstates

for a given density and current

To ﬁnd a potential v(x) for a given form of the Hamil-
tonian, i.e., interacting or non-interacting, that has an
eigenstate which reproduces a given density n(x) and
current density j(x) = 0, we employ an iterative method
along the lines of van Leeuwen [33]. The iteration steps
read

vk+1(x) = vk(x) + δ

− 1

,

(A1)

(cid:18) nk(x)

n(x)

(cid:19)

where nk(x) is the density of the eigenstate of vk(x)
and we choose δ > 0 small enough. We see that the
procedure in each iteration simply increases the poten-
tial where the density is too large, to push away den-
sity, and decreases the potential where the density is too
small, to collect more density. If we prescribe a ground-
state density (no nodes) and use the ground-state den-
sity nk(x) of vk(x) in each iteration then, if the procedure
converges, the solution is a unique ground-state due to
the Hohenberg-Kohn uniqueness theorem. In this way
we can determine the ground-state potentials vg.s.[n](x)
(see Eq. (13) and discussion thereafter) in the interacting
case. This would also work in the non-interacting case,
but in our two-particle spin-singlet case the ground-
state potential in the non-interacting case is known ex-
plicitly and hence we can directly use Eq. (7).
On the other hand,
if we restrict the form of our
Kohn-Sham wave function Φ(a(cid:54)=0) in the above iteration
scheme and thus have

n(a)(x) =

(2 + a2)φ0(x)2 + 2

2aφ0(x)φ1(x) + a2φ1(x)2

,

(A2)
we are constructing an excited state of a non-interacting
problem. Hence, if we converge, we can no longer rely
on the Hohenberg-Kohn uniqueness theorem and con-
sequently we can ﬁnd several solutions, such as in the
case a = 1 (see cases (ii) and (iii) in section II).
