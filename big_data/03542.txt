Abstract

Establishing the completeness of a Bethe Ansatz solution for an exactly solved model is a perennial
challenge, which is typically approached on a case by case basis. For the rational, spin-1/2 Richardson–
Gaudin system it will be shown that completeness can be deduced through a direct approach. This
method does not depend on knowledge of the distribution of Bethe roots, such as a string hypothesis,
and is generalisable to a wider class of systems.

Introduction

Since Bethe ﬁrst introduced the notion of an Ansatz approach through his study of the Heisenberg XXX
chain [1], a recurring question is whether a particular Bethe Ansatz solution is complete. For the XXX
chain this is a problem which has attracted signiﬁcant attention (see [2] for a historical overview), and one
which has continued to produce research results up until recent times [3–5]. Similar analyses have been
performed for other models, e.g. [6–9]. In all of these studies steps are undertaken to ﬁrst identify that
solutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations have some regular structure, such as that of a string hypothesis,
and then a counting argument is applied to determine the number of such solutions. However this approach
is challenged by the fact that there are singular [3] and exceptional [10] solutions which, roughly speaking,
are associated with divergent Bethe roots and/or Bethe vectors that may or may not be regularisable. This
feature complicates the counting process.

The rational, spin-1/2 Richardson–Gaudin system is closely related to the XXX chain in the sense
that it can be derived in the quasi-classical limit of the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method based on
the rational six-vertex solution of the Yang-Baxter equation [11]. It will be shown below that, for generic
values of the system’s coupling parameters, completeness of the Bethe Ansatz solution can be deduced using
only standard techniques. The approach taken is very much inﬂuenced by the recent development of the
oﬀ-diagonal Bethe Ansatz method based on functional relations [12].

2 The rational, spin-1/2 Richardson–Gaudin system

For a set of distinct real parameters {zj : j = 1, ..., L} the rational, spin-1/2 Richardson–Gaudin system is
described by the self-adjoint operators Tj ∈ End(C2)⊗L of the form

Tj = ασz

j +

Pjk − I
zj − zk

,

L

Xk6=j

j = 1, ..., L

(1)

which are mutually commuting. viz

[Tj, Tk] = 0

∀ j, k.

Above, I is the identity operator, σz = diag(1, −1) ∈ End(C2) is a standard Pauli matrix, and P ∈
End(C2)⊗2 is the permutation operator satisfying

P(x ⊗ y) = y ⊗ x,

∀x, y ∈ C2.

The subscripts associated with operators appearing in the right-hand side of (1) denote the tensor compo-
nents within (C2)⊗L on which each of these operators act.

Due to the properties of commutativity and being self-adjoint the set {Tj : j = 1, ..., L} is simultaneously
diagonaliable, which is described in terms of a Bethe Ansatz solution. For α = 0, the operators (1) ﬁrst
appeared in the work of Gaudin in 1976 [13], along with the Bethe Ansatz solution. Commutativity of the
operators for α 6= 0 was established by Sklyanin using the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method in the quasi-
classical limit [11]. Independently, the same operators were constructed in [14] and shown to commute with
the s-wave pairing Hamiltonian which was solved by Richardson much earlier in 1963 [15]. The concrete
connection between Richardson’s solution and Quantum Inverse Scattering Method results was made in
2002 [16, 17].

To describe the Bethe Ansatz solution of the system, the eigenvalue of each conserved operator Tj on a

simultaneous eigenstate takes the form

where the parameters {vj : j = 1, ..., M } satisfy the Bethe Ansatz equations

λl = α −

zl − vj

vj − zl

Xl=1

Xk6=j

vj − vk

,

j = 1, ..., M.

(3)

Explicit expressions for the eigenstates associated with each solution of (3) are known [11, 16, 17], but will
not be required here.

If there is a multiplicity of some roots in (3) this results in a singularity in the system of equations. This

may be circumvented by introducing the polynomials

L

P (u) =

Q(u) =

M

Yl=1
Yj=1

(u − zl),

(u − vj).

In the absence of root multiplicities (2) and (3) can then be respectively expressed in a polynomial form

Q′(zl) = (α + λl)Q(zl),
(2αP (vj) + P ′(vj ))Q′(vj ) = P (vj)Q′′(vj),

l = 1, ..., L,

j = 1, ..., M.

(4)

Now supposing that vj occurs with multiplicity 2, then Q′(vj) = 0, Q′′(vj) 6= 0 which implies from (4) that

vj ∈ {zl : l = 1, ..., L}.

Through numerical studies [18] this behaviour was conﬁrmed to occur at discrete values of α. Hereafter (4)
will be considered as the standard presentation for the Bethe Ansatz equations, such that root multiplicities
can be adequately accommodated. However, for calculational ease, only the generic case where no root
multiplicities occur will be considered in the algebraic manipulations below.

the eigenvalues χ of U are readily obtained as having integer spacing, and belonging to the set

Thus the operator U is a u(1) invariant which partitions (C2)⊗L into sectors associated with each χ. From
the Bethe Ansatz solution (4) it is found that

which establishes the relationship χ = L/2 − M .

A solution set of (4) with M roots, or equivalently a polynomial Q(u) of order M , provides a candidate
for determining elements in the spectra of the Tj associated with the sector for which U has eigenvalue χ.
It is possible that such a solution of (4) does not correspond to a simultaneous eigenstate. In the literature
this is often known as a spurious solution. The aim of this work is to establish that the correspondence in
the other direction is complete for generic values of α 6= 0. That is, for a simultaneous eigenstate in the
sector associated with χM there exists a polynomial Q(u) of order M such that the roots of this polynomial
satisfy (4). It seems that there is not much published literature on this problem, other than some studies for
the α = 0 case [19, 20]. In that instance, counting of states requires the identiﬁcation of singular solutions
associated with divergent Bethe roots, which is avoided here.

3 Operator identities

It was observed in [21, 22] that a diﬀerent form of the Bethe Ansatz solution can be presented solely in
terms of the variables {λj}, rather than the variables {vk}, which has a quadratic form:

λ2
j = α2 −

λj − λk
zj − zk

,

L

Xk6=j

j = 1, ..., L.

(5)

This form of solution has recently been proposed [22], along with those for similar systems [22–24], as an
alternative for both numerical computation of the spectra for the commuting operators and for the devel-
opment of correlation functions.

PROPOSITION 1: The following operator identities hold,

1The claim that (5) is complete does not exclude the possibility that there are also spurious solutions of (5).

It is worth noting that similar operator identities have been noted at the level of a generalised version

of (1) [25].

4 A generalised Bethe Ansatz solution

Having established that the equations (5) are complete, the next step is to show that the variables {λj} can
be mapped back to Bethe roots {vk}. First, this problem will be considered in a generalised context.

For β 6= α, the eigenvalue Ansatz

λj = β −

Q′
β(zj)
Qβ(zj)

(8)

is adopted. Here Qβ(u) is a polynomial of order N , yet to be determined, such that N ≤ L. Writing

leads to a system of L linear equations for L + 1 parameters ql,

Qβ(u) =

qlul,

Q′

β(u) =

L

Xl=0

lqlul−1

L

Xl=1

where

Ajlql = 0,

j = 1, ..., L,

L

Xl=0

Aj0 = λj − β,
Ajl = (λj − β)zl

j + lzl−1

j

.

Because the system is under-determined, there necessarily exists a non-trivial solution, and therefore it is
possible to construct Qβ(u) such that (8) holds.

It may turn out that Qβ(zj) = 0 for some j = 1, ..., L in which case the following calculations would
need to be modiﬁed to ensure that appropriate limits are taken carefully. However an advantage of this
generalised approach is that, alternatively, β can be varied in order to avoid such a singularity.

PROPOSITION 2: For β 6= α let

N

where the β-dependence on the roots {vj} has been suppressed. If the roots of Qβ(u) are multiplicity-free,
then N = L and

Qβ(u) =

which is a polynomial of order N . It follows from (12) that

Sβ(zj) = 0,

j = 1, ..., L

which, along with the consideration of the asymptotic behaviour of (13) as u → ∞, establishes that

Sβ(u) = (β 2 − α2)P (u)

and consequently N = L. Evaluating Sβ(vl) through (13) then yields the generalised Bethe Ansatz equations
(9) which, by construction based on the {λj} satisfying (5), are complete for generic values of α 6= 0 .

It remains to also consider the case β = α, for which justiﬁcation of the steps goes through with only
minor modiﬁcation. The previous argument is valid up to deriving (13) with β = α 6= 0, in which case (12)
shows that

Evaluating Sα(vl) through (13) produces

Sα(u) = 0.

which imposes that N = M whenever α 6= 0. The calculation shows that as β → α, the order of Qβ(u)
drops from L to M . This is indicative of L − M roots of Qβ(u) diverging in this limit.

5 Conclusion

An argument was presented to deduce that the Bethe Ansatz solution, including a generalised version, of
the rational, spin-1/2 Richardson-Gaudin system is complete for generic values of α 6= 0. The argument
is not strictly rigorous in the sense that some of the calculations presented only apply in the case where
there are no multiplicities of Bethe roots. But numerical results point towards the multiplicity-free case
being the generic setting [18], and moreover with appropriate modiﬁcations it is anticipated that instances
of multiplicities can be accommodated.

Distinct from previous studies, the method presented does not assume knowledge of the distribution
of Bethe roots, such as in a string hypothesis, nor is it reliant on counting the number of solutions. It is
instead founded on the operator identities (6). As such it can generalised. First, the method applies to
a generalised version of the system without u(1) symmetry [26], whereby the relevant operator identities
are given in [25]. Moreover, higher-spin generalisations are possible. The form of appropriate operator
identities can be inferred from the systems of eigenvalue variable equations derived in [21, 22]. Analyses for
these generalised systems will be reported in due course [27].
