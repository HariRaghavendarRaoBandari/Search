Abstract

We investigate the invariant mass distributions of Bsπ via different rescattering processes. Because the
triangle singularity (TS) could be present for a very broad incident energy region, it can be expected that the
TS peaks may simulate the resonance-like bump X(5568) observed by the D0 collaboration. The highly
process-dependent characteristic of TS mechanism offers a criterion to distinguish it from other dynamic
mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION

The study on exotic hadron spectroscopy is experiencing a renaissance in the last decade. More
and more charmonium-like and bottomonium-like states (called XY Z) have been announced
by experiments in various processes (see Refs. [1–4] for a review). Several charged structures
with a hidden ¯bb or ¯cc, such as theZ ±
c (3900) [8, 9], and
c (4020) [10] were observed by experiments, which would be exotic state candidates. Very re-
Z ±
s π± invariant mass spec-
cently, the D0 collaboration observed a narrow structure X(5568) in the B0
trum with 5.1σ signiﬁcance [11]. The mass and width are measured to be MX = 5567.8 ± 2.9+2.9
−1.9
MeV and ΓX = 21.9 ± 6.4+5.0
−2.5 MeV, respectively. The quark components of the decaying ﬁnal
s π± are su¯b ¯d (or sd¯b¯u), which requires X(5568) should be a structure with four different
state B0
valence quarks.

After the discovery of X(5568), several theoretical investigations are carried out in order to
understand its underlying structure. In Ref. [12], the mass and decay constant of X(5568) were
computed within the two-point sum rule method using the diquark-antidiquark interpolating cur-
rent. The mass and pole residue are studied with the QCD sum rules in [13]. Its mass spectrum was
also calculated in Ref. [14, 15] using diquark-antidiquark type interpolating current. In Ref. [16],
s π+ with X(5568) being an S-wave
the authors estimated the partial decay width X(5568) → B0
B ¯K molecular state.

It is necessary to study some other possibilities, before we claim that X(5568) is a genuine
particle, such as tetraquark or molecular state. Some non-resonance explanations have ever been
proposed to connect resonance-like peaks with kinematic singularities induced by the rescattering
effects [17–29]. It is shown that sometimes it is not necessary to introduce a genuine resonance
to describe a resonance-like structure, because some kinematic singularities of the rescattering
amplitudes will behave themselves as bumps in the invariant mass distributions. In this work, we
are trying to use the so-called triangle singularity (TS) mechanism to describe the observation of
X(5568).

The work is organized as follows: In Section II, the TS mechanism is brieﬂy introduced; In
Section III, we discuss several rescattering processes where the TS can be present and simulate
the resonance. A brief summary is given in Section IV.

II. TS MECHANISM

The possible manifestation of the TS was ﬁrst noticed in 1960s. It is found that the TS’s of
rescattering amplitudes can mimic resonance structures in the corresponding invariant mass distri-
butions [30–40]. This offers a non-resonance explanation about the resonance-like peaks observed

in experiments. Unfortunately, most of the proposed cases in 1960s were lack of experimental
support. The TS mechanism was rediscovered in recent years and used to interpret some exotic
phenomena, such as the largely isospin-violation processes, the production of some exotic states
and so on [22–29, 41–44].

For the triangle diagram in Fig. 1, all of the three internal lines can be on-shell simultaneously
under some special kinematic conﬁgurations. This case corresponds to the leading Landau sin-
gularity of the triangle diagram, and this leading Landau singularity is usually called the TS. The
physical picture concerning the TS mechanism can be understood like this: The initial particles ka
and kb ﬁrstly scatter into particles q2 and q3, then the particle q1 emitted from q2 catches up with
q3, and ﬁnally q2 and q3 will rescatter into particles pb and pc. This implies that the rescattering
diagram can be interpreted as a classical process in space-time with the presence of TS, and the
TS will be located on the physical boundary of the rescattering amplitude [36].

The TS mechanism is very sensitive to the kinematic conﬁgurations of rescattering diagrams.
It is therefore necessary to determine in which kinematic region the TS can be present. In Fig. 1,
we deﬁne the invariants s1 = (ka + kb)2, s2 = (pb + pc)2 and s3 = p2
a. The locations of TS can be
determined by solving the so-called Landau equations [45–47]. For the diagram in Fig. 1, if we
ﬁx the internal masses mi, the external invariants s2 and s3, we can obtain the solutions of TS in
s1, i.e.,

with λ(x, y, z) = (x − y − z)2 − 4yz. Likewise, by ﬁxing mi, s1 and s3 we can obtain the similar
solutions of TS in s2, i.e.,

By means of the single dispersion representation of the 3-point function, we learn that within the
2 will correspond to the TS of rescattering amplitude,
physical boundary only the solution s−
and ps−
2 are usually deﬁned as the anomalous thresholds [43, 46, 47]. For convenience,
we further deﬁne the normal threshold √s1N (√s2N ) and the critical value √s1C (√s2C) for s1
(s2) as follows [43],

1 and ps−

s1N = (m2 + m3)2, s1C = (m2 + m3)2 +

s2N = (m1 + m3)2, s2C = (m1 + m3)2 +

[(m2 − m1)2 − s3],
[(m2 − m1)2 − s3].
If we ﬁx s3 and the internal masses m1,2,3, when s1 increases from s1N to s1C, s−
2 will move from
s2C to s2N. Likewise, when s2 increases from s2N to s2C, s−
1 will move from s1C to s1N. This is the
kinematic region where the TS can be present. The discrepancies between normal and anomalous
thresholds can also be used to represent the TS kinematic region. The maximum values of these
discrepancies take the form

In Ref. [40], it was argued that for the single channel rescattering process, when the correspond-
ing resonance-production tree diagram is added coherently to the triangle rescattering diagram, the
effect of the triangle diagram is nothing more than a multiplication of the singularity from the tree
diagram by a phase factor. Therefore the singularities of triangle diagram cannot produce ob-
vious peaks in the Dalitz plot projections. This is the so-called Schmid theorem. But for the
coupled-channel cases, the situation will be quite different from the single channel case discussed
in Ref. [40]. For the rescattering diagrams which will be studied in this paper, the intermediate
and ﬁnal states are different, therefore the singularities induced by the rescattering processes are
still expected to be visible in the Dalitz plot projections. The reader is referred to Refs. [34, 48]
for some comments about the Schmid theorem, and Refs. [49, 50] for some discussions about the
coupled-channel case. We will focus on the coupled-channel cases in this work.

The mass of X(5568) is very close to the B∗

s π±-threshold, which is about 5555 MeV [2]. One
may wonder whether there are some connections between X(5568) and the coupled-channel scat-
tering B∗
s π → Bsπ near threshold. In the high energy collisions, the production of Bsπ may
receive contributions from rescattering diagrams illustrated in Fig. 2. The intriguing character-
istic of this kind of diagrams is TS’s are expected to be present in the rescattering amplitudes,
which may result in some resonance-like bumps in Bsπ distributions around the B∗
s π-threshold
accordingly.

The momentum and invariants conventions of Fig. 2 are the same with those of Fig. 1. Ac-
cording to Eqs. (3) and (4), the kinematic region where the TS can be present is displayed in
Table I. It can be seen that the kinematic region of TS in s1 is very large for both of the diagrams
in Fig. 2. ∆max
is nearly 1 GeV for each of the diagrams. Firstly, this is because the quantity

s1

4

[(m2 − m1)2 − s3] in Eq. (4) is large. Physically, this quantity corresponds to the phase-space
factor for ρ → ππ (K ∗ → Kπ), which is sizable. Secondly, the ratio m3/m1 is equal to MB∗
s /Mπ,
which is also quite large. This means that the kinematic conditions of the presence of TS can be
fulﬁlled in a very broad energy region of incident states. The kinematic requirement on the inci-
dent state would be largely relaxed, which is an advantage to observe the effects resulted by the
TS mechanism. On the other hand, the kinematic region of TS in s2 is relatively smaller. ∆max
is
about 0.2 GeV for each of the diagrams, which implies that the TS peaks in Bsπ distributions may
not stay far away from the B∗

s π-threshold (normal threshold √s2N ).

We will naively construct some effective Lagrangians to estimate the behaviour of the rescat-
tering amplitudes. Taking into account the conservation of angular momentum and parity, the
quantum numbers of the incident state A are set to be J P =1+. Some of the Lagrangians read

for this vertex.

Figs. 2(a) and (b), respectively. W is the invariant mass √s1 of incident state A. The vertical dashed line
indicates the position of X(5568).

When the kinematic conditions of TS are fulﬁlled, it will imply that the particle q2 in Fig. 1 will
be unstable. We then introduce a Breit-Wigner type propagator [q2
2 + im2Γ2]−1 to account for
the width effect when calculating the triangle loop integrals. The complex mass of the intermediate
state will remove the TS from physical boundary by a distance [35]. If the width Γ2 is not very
large, the TS will lie close to the physical boundary, and the scattering amplitude can still feel the
inﬂuence of the singularity.

The numerical results for Bsπ invariant mass distributions corresponding to the rescattering
processes in Fig. 2 are displayed in Fig. 3. We ignore the explicit couplings but just focus on the
line-shape behavior here. The distributions are calculated at several incident energy points. From

5

Fig. 3, it can be seen that some bumps arise around the position of X(5568). Since the bumps
around X(5568) can be present for a very broad incident energy region, it is possible that the
observation of X(5568) is due to some kind of accumulative effects of the rescattering amplitudes
at different incident energies.

The bumps in Fig. 3(a) are broader compared with those in Fig. 3(b). This is because the decay
width of ρ-meson (149 MeV) is larger than that of K ∗-meson (50 MeV) [2]. The larger decay
width will remove the corresponding TS in the complex-plane further away from the physical
boundary. The P -wave scattering B∗

s π → Bsπ will also smooth the TS peaks to some extent.

The scattering process B∗

s π → Bsπ would be OZI suppressed. In Eq. (7), we assume a con-
tact interaction, which may account for the short range part of this interaction. If we take into
account the t-channel contributions, because the momentum transfer in this process will be very
small, some long range interactions, such as the electromagnetic (EM) interaction, may become
important. To judge whether the EM interaction may play a role in B∗
s π → Bsπ, we will compare
the contributions of t-channel processes illustrated in Fig. 4.
In Figs. 4(a) and (b), we use the photon- and φ-exchange diagrams to partly account for the EM

and strong interactions, respectively. Some effective Lagrangians are constructed as follows

cording to the decay widths of φ → e+e− and φ → ππ, respectively. The ratio Rγ/φ is then
obtained to be about 0.9. According to this naive estimation, we can see that the EM couplings
may not be very smaller compared with the OZI suppressed strong couplings. Without introducing
any form factors to account for the off-shell effects, we further integrate over the moment transfer
t and obtain the cross section ratios σγ/σφ for different scattering energies, which is displayed in
Fig. 5. We can see that the cross section corresponding to Fig. 4(a) is larger than that correspond-
ing to Fig. 4(b) by about three orders of magnitude. This is mainly because the quantity 1/t is
much larger than 1/(t − m2
φ). We can then make a quantitative judgment that the contribution of
EM interaction may be comparable with that of strong interaction.

Taking into account the above arguments, the triangle diagram in Fig. 2 can be changed into the
box diagram in Fig. 6 accordingly, and the numerical results for the Bsπ invariant mass distribu-
tions are displayed in Fig. 7. Because the masses of Bs and B∗
s are different, it can be judged that
there will no infrared divergence in these box diagrams [55]. Compared with the resonance-like
bumps in Fig. 3, the bumps in Fig. 7 are much narrower and more like resonance peaks. This

s π → Bsπ, one cannot expect there
will be TS peaks arising in the Bsπ0 invariant mass distributions, because there is no γπ0π0 vertex.
We can further conclude that if the observation of X(5568) is due to the rescattering effects and
the long range EM interaction dominates the scattering B∗
s π → Bsπ, there will no charge neutral
partner of X(5568).

As stated before, the process A → B∗

as B(∗∗)
s V . Interestingly, according to the quark model calculation in Ref. [56], it can
be noticed that there are many charm-beauty mesons B(∗∗)
, of which the masses just fall into the
region 6.2−7.5 GeV. This energy region has a large overlap with the TS kinematic region displayed
in Table I. This is another support that the TS mechanism may play a role in the observation of
X(5568).

IV. SUMMARY

In this paper, we investigated the invariant mass distributions of Bsπ via different rescattering
processes. Because the TS’s of rescattering amplitudes could be present for a very broad incident
energy region, one can expect that the TS peaks may mimic the resonance-like structure X(5568).
The TS mechanism is highly process-dependent, which is different from other dynamic mecha-
nisms. If the kinematic conditions of the TS are not fulﬁlled, there will be no peaks arising in
the amplitudes. However, one would expect that the genuine particles should also appear in the
processes where kinematic conditions of the TS are not fulﬁlled. If the observation of X(5568)
is due to the rescattering effects, because of the P -wave scattering characteristic of the process
s π → Bsπ, the quantum numbers of “X(5568)” would be J P = 1−. This is different from the
B∗
assignment of diquark-antidiquark picture [12–15] or B(∗) ¯K molecular state model [16], where the
quantum numbers are set to be 0+ or 1+. Further experiments with angular distribution analysis
may help us to clarify the ambiguities and check different mechanisms.
