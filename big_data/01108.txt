Abstract. The quantum-to-classical transition is considered from the point of view
of contractions of associative algebras. Various methods and ideas to deal with
contractions of associative algebras are discussed that account for a large family of
examples. As an instance of them, the commutative algebra of functions in phase
space, corresponding to classical physical observables, is obtained as a contraction
of the Moyal star-product which characterizes the quantum case. Contractions of
associative algebras associated to Lie algebras are discussed, in particular the Weyl-
Heisenberg and SU (2) groups are considered.

The quantum-to-classical transition: contraction of associative products

1. Introduction

In this paper “decoherence” dissipation, or transition to classicality, will be discussed
within the framework of contraction of algebraic structures by exploring a contraction
procedure of associative algebras (see for instance [1, 2] and references therein).

The quantum-to-classical transition is a fascinating subject both from the physical,
mathematical and philosophical point of view. At the dawn of the quantum theory, it
entered the picture as the “correspondence principle” [3, 4] and the so-called wave-
particle duality was elevated to the “principle of complementarity” [5] but, more
formally, in the Schr¨odinger picture, the quantum-to-classical transition can be described
as the transition from the Schr¨odinger to the Hamilton-Jacobi equations of classical
mechanics for a given state represented as a wave function (see [6]).

Recently, the double-slit interference experiment with electrons [7, 8], has been
enhanced by using a plate of conductor material with very high resistivity [9, 10] (Figure
1). By changing the distance δ of the conductor from the path of the electrons it is
possible to decide which way the electron went by exploiting the Joule eﬀect due to
the motion of the mirror charge. Here the visibility parameter gives a measure of the
“classicality” of the state and can also be considered as a “deformation” parameter.

(auxiliary coils and equipment has been omitted from the picture).

In the same vein and in the Heisenberg picture, the quantum-to-classical transition
can be described in terms of the quantizer-dequantizer formalism as a  → 0 limit process
in the algebra structure fA ∗ fB were fA is the phase space function associated to the
quantum observable A and the product is the  depending star-product fA ∗ fB = fAB
which turns out to be non-local and non-commutative (see for instance [11]).

Then, the non-locality could be “measured” by considering the extension of the
region where the expectation values of the selected observables are sensibly diﬀerent
from zero. In this setting the transition from a non-local product to a local one is well
described by the Moyal approach in terms of higher order bi-diﬀerential operators which,
at zeroth order in the Planck’s constant, ﬁxes the pointwise product and, at ﬁrst order
in , gives the Poisson bracket (see for instance [12] [13] [14] and references therein).

In this work we will concentrate mostly on the non-commutativity of the family of

The quantum-to-classical transition: contraction of associative products

selected measurable operators, considering that the commutative case corresponds to
the classical situation and the less commutative, ‘less classical’ or ‘more quantum’ the
system, and the states describing it, is. Thus, in a sense, we take the point of view that
“full classicality” is achieved when all observables commute pairwise.

In the intermediate stages, a greater degree of “classicality” may be ascribed to
a larger number of observables which pairwise commute. Thus for instance, in the
previously described double-slit experiment with a conductive plate, we may consider
that the commutation relation of the position observables ˆx, ˆy for the electron will have
the form [ˆx, ˆy] ∼ δ where δ is the distance from the plane of the electron to the plate.
Hence the limit δ → 0 will correspond to the classical situation (no interference) while
as δ increases, the quantum nature of the system prevails. Notice, however, that this is
not the standard description of the double-slit experiment where the quantum position
observables, ˆx and ˆy, do commute.

The mathematical construction which takes us from a maximally non-commuting
to a larger and larger family of pairwise commuting observables goes under the name
of ‘contraction procedure’ (see for instance, [1, 15]). Therefore we will consider here
the contraction procedure applied to associative structures to describe the quantum-
to-classical transition, and in the case of the associative ∗ product above, it will be
applied to its associative kernel, which appear when operators are replaced by functions
on some measure space and the operator product is replaced by a star-product as in the
quantizer-dequantizer formalism (see below, Sects. 2.2, 2.4).

Before entering the details of this idea, let us ﬁrst brieﬂy recall how contraction
procedures entered Physics by the hands of In¨on¨u and Wigner [17], but also Segal [18]
and Saletan [19], in the early Fifties.

Starting from the consideration that Minkowski space-time ‘reduces’ to Galileo’s
space-time when the speed of light tends to inﬁnite, in 1953 In¨on¨u and Wigner suggested
that the inhomogeneous Lorentz group should give as a limiting case, when the velocity
of the light goes to inﬁnity, the Galilei group. They introduced what nowadays is called
the contraction procedure for Lie algebras.

Thus Wigner-In¨on¨u’s procedure [17] to contract the SU(2) algebra to get the motion
group E(2) algebra is based on the use of a parameter depending linear transform Tǫ in
the vector space of the Lie algebra of the group. It is assumed that for any value ǫ 6= 0
the linear transformation is invertible and becomes singular for ǫ = 0. If the appropriate
limit on the structure constants exists, we get new structure constants that, provided
they satisfy Jacobi’s identity, could correspond eventually to a diﬀerent Lie algebra
structure.

Of course, similar considerations can be made with respect to the limit of Planck’s
constant  going to zero when considered within the structure constants deﬁning the
Lie algebra of the Heisenberg-Weyl group.
In this case the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra
contracts to the corresponding Abelian algebra. Even more generally, if we have a
family of generators closing on a ﬁnite dimensional Lie algebra, then Ado’s theorem
provides the possibility to realize this Lie algebra by means of an algebra of matrices,

The quantum-to-classical transition: contraction of associative products

4

hence to extend the Lie algebra structure to an associative algebra of matrices. Thus
it would be possible to study contractions of algebras of matrices using Ado’s theorem
under this guise.

Here we apply the same procedure when the structure constants are those of an
associative algebra. In particular the associative algebra may be a group algebra or a
groupoid algebra. More generally it could be a star-product algebra originating from
some operator algebra via a quantizer-dequantizer procedure [11] [20] [21] [22]. Thus
in the quantizer-dequantizer scheme it seems quite natural to consider the contraction
procedure at the level of kernel functions that play the role of the structure constants
of the associative product, clearly extending in this manner the Lie algebra contraction
procedure considered by In¨on¨u and Wigner.

Similar problems have been already considered in the tomographic picture [20] in
connection, for instance, with the fate of the complex structure in going from quantum
to classical mechanics [14].

Here we would like to take up ﬁrst the problem of contractions at the level of
Weyl systems considered as unitary representations of the Heisenberg-Weyl group, in
particular in connection with the group algebra associated to a given Lie group and
the convolution product. Let us mention here that related papers, connected with
dissipation or decoherence seen as a contraction procedure, have appeared recently
[15, 16].

Summarizing, we may say that in this short paper we will try only to outline
the main ideas and diﬃculties which arise in trying to implement the “contraction
procedure” on associative algebras, a more systematic analysis should be postponed to
a future paper.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, and as a motivation example, we
present the quantum-to-classical transition as a contraction in the Gr¨onewald kernel of
the star-product of functions on phase-space associated with the Heisenberg-Weyl group
algebra when  → 0 [13]. Moreover a general scheme to ﬁnd new structure constants
in the framework of the quantizer-dequantizer formalism will be analized too. In Sect.
3 we will discuss a general and fairly simple description for the contraction procedure
for associative algebras and we will illustrate it in some simple examples. In Sect. 4,
ﬁnally, some perspectives and conclusions are drawn.

2. The case of inﬁnite dimensional algebras: Weyl systems, the quantizer-
dequantizer formalism and the contraction of the Moyal product

2.1. Weyl systems

We discuss in this section the properties of Weyl systems [23] [24] and Weyl quantization
[25] in the context of the star-product formalism provided by a class of quantizer-
dequantizer operators [11]. The Weyl quantization is a particular case of the star-
product formalism to be discussed later on (see Sect. 2.2), but the material of this

section can be read independently of it. Planck’s constant  will be set to 1 in the
formulae but will be reintroduced when necessary for considering the limit  → 0.

A Weyl system W is deﬁned as a map from an Abelian complex vector group E to
the group of unitary operators on some Hilbert space H (we restrict for simplicity to
one-dimensional complex spaces) such as:

where

cW (z) = exp(cid:2)zˆa† − z∗ˆa(cid:3)

ˆa =

ˆq + iˆp
√2

,

ˆa† =

[ˆq, ˆp] = i,

ˆq − iˆp
√2

are boson creation and annihilation operators with commutation relation:

[ˆa, ˆa†] = 1 ,

(1)

(2)

(3)

and ˆq and ˆp are dimensionless position and momentum operators, respectively. The
complex coordinate:
1
√2

(q + ip) ,

z =

(4)

where the pair (q, p) determines a point in the complex one-dimensional Abelian vector
group E determines its complex structure.

Weyl quantization provides a bijective map from functions on E into operators
acting on the Hilbert space H, i.e., it maps phase-space functions f = f (q, p) into
operators ˆf on H (e.g., the quantum harmonic oscillator states deﬁne the space of
square integrable functions on the line), by means of the formula:

(5)

ˆf =

1

πZ f (q, p)cW (2z)bP dqdp.

Here bP is the parity operator, i.e., bPψ(x) = ψ(−x).

by:

The inverse transform provides a map from operators ˆf to functions f (q, p), given

Weyl’s quantization provides an example of a realization of a star-product scheme
in which the functions on phase-space are multiplied according to Moyal’s deformed
product [12] [25], i.e., a non-local and non-commutative product of the form:

f (q, p) = 2 Tr ( ˆfcW (2z)bP) .
(f1 ∗ f2) (q, p) =Z f1(q1, p1)f2(q2, p2)K(q1, p1, q2, p2, q, p) dq1dp1dq2dp2 .(7)

Moyal’s product can also be described by using a pair of operators, the dequantizer

(6)

bU (q, p) and the quantizer bD(q, p) operators given by:
bU(q, p) = 2cW (2z)bP = 2cW (√2q + i√2p)bP,
Tr(bU (q, p)bD(q′, p′)) = δ(q − q′)δ(p − p′) .

that satisfy the biorthogonality relation:

bD(q, p) =

1

2πbU (q, p) (8)

(9)

The quantum-to-classical transition: contraction of associative products

Hence formulae (5) and (6) can be rewritten in terms of the previous quantizer and

dequantizer operators as:

and

ˆf =Z dqdpbD(q, p)f (q, p)
f (q, p) = Tr( ˆf bU(q, p))
K(q1, p1, q2, p2, q3, p3) = Tr(bD(q1, p1)bD(q2, p2)bU(q3, p3)) .

The kernel K of Moyal’s star-product in Eq. (7), can be written again in terms of the
quantizer and dequantizer operators as:

(15)

(16)

(17)

2.2. Quantizer-dequantizer formalism

The quantizer-dequantizer formalism used in the previous section to express Weyl’s
quantization in a compact form, Eqs. (10)-(12), can be nicely expressed in a general
setting as follows.

Let bU(x),bD(x) be two maps, called the dequantizer and quantizer respectively,

from a measure space X in the space of operators describing a quantum system and
such that they satisfy the biorthogonality relation:

(13)
where δ(x, x′) denotes the delta distribution along the diagonal of X × X. Given an
operator ˆA, the function on X deﬁned as:

will be called the symbol of ˆA with respect to the dequantizer bU . Clearly, because of

(13), the operator ˆA can be recovered from its symbol as:

The star-product of symbols of operators ˆA and ˆB determined by the dequantizer

bU (x) and the quantizer bD(x), f ˆA∗f ˆB = Tr (U(x) ˆA ˆB), is given by the kernel K(x1, x2, x3)

[11]:

by means of:

K(x1, x2, x3) = Tr(cid:16)bD(x1)bD(x2)bU (x3)(cid:17) ,
(f ˆA ∗ f ˆB) (x3) =Z K(x1, x2, x3)f ˆA(x1)f ˆB(x2) dx1 dx2 .

T r(bU(x)bD(x′)) = δ(x, x′) ,
f ˆA(x) = Tr(bU(x) ˆA) ,
ˆA =Z f ˆA(x)bD(x) dx ,

2.3. Tomographic picture of quantum states

We can apply the previous quantizer-dequantizer construction in a diﬀerent way as we
did in the case of Weyl’s quantization to get the so called tomographic symbols of the
operators [26], [20] and the corresponding associative star-product.

The tomographic approach uses the dequantizer,

By using them we deﬁne the symbol-map which associates with any operator ˆA the
function

and the quantizer,

and

bD(X, µ, ν) =

K (X1, µ1, ν1, X2, µ2, ν2, X3, µ3, ν3) =

The kernel of the tomographic star-product reads,

and explicitely [11]:

K (X1, µ1, ν1, X2, µ2, ν2, X3, µ3, ν3) =

4π2 δ (ν3(µ1 + µ2) − µ3(ν1 + ν2))×

(ν1µ2 − ν2µ1)(cid:21) .

This kernel determines the tomographic product of functions f (X, µ, ν).

2.4. The commutative product as a contraction of the Moyal star-product

On the other hand, the pointwise product of functions on the phase-space

(fA ∗ fB)(q, p) = fA(q, p)fB(q, p) ,

is given by the kernel

K(q1, p1, q2, p2, q3, p3) = δ(q1 − q3)δ(q2 − q3)δ(p1 − p3)δ(p2 − p3) .

(25)
The kernel of the pointwise product (25) is the  → 0 limit of the Gr¨onewald kernel
[13]:

G (q1, p1, q2, p2, q3, p3) =

π22 exp(cid:18) 2i

[q1p2 − q2p1 + q2p3 − q3p2 + q3p1 − q1p3](cid:19) . (26)



The quantum-to-classical transition: contraction of associative products

8

To see this we use the equivalent form of the Moyal product given by the following
formula (see for instance [27]) where we have reintroduced the Planck constant,

(fA ∗ fB) (q, p) = fA(q, p) exp

i

2  ←−∂

∂q

−→∂
∂p −

←−∂
∂p

−→∂

∂q! fB(q, p) ,

(27)

and where the arrows mean that the diﬀerentiation is applied to the left factor fA(q, p)
or to the right factor fB(q, p) respectively.

For  = 0, Eq. (27) gives the pointwise rule of multiplication described also by
the integral kernel (25). In the Moyal formulation of quantum mechanics the Planck
constant  is mathematically interpreted as a “deformation” parameter providing a
noncommutative and non-local product on pairs of functions on the phase-space. When
the deformation parameter is zero one has the standard classical mechanics formalism,
with the pointwise commutative and associative product.

It is worthy to note that the explicit procedure to take the limit  → 0 needs delicate
attention. The limit is obvious in the product formula (27), even if it relies on the formal
series expansion of the exponential bidiﬀerential operator deﬁning the product, whereas
when the Gr¨onewald kernel is considered, the limit in the integral kernel expression of
the product needs an accurate calculation (see below). The classical limit,  → 0, of the
deformed Moyal product was also considered by Thirring [29] by using the properties of
Weyl systems.

We will show now that the limit  → 0 in the Gr¨onewald kernel of the Moyal

product provides the kernel of the pointwise product as well.

To do that we will notice ﬁrst that the geometrical meaning of the term in the
exponent of the Gr¨onewald kernel Eq. (26), is the area S of the triangle in phase-space
with vertices (q1, p1), (q2, p2) and (q3, p3), respectively. Since the area is invariant with
respect to translations, we may consider the triangle whose vertex (q3, p3) has been
shifted to the origin of the reference frame under consideration. It means that in the
new system of coordinates
˜q1 = q1 − q3 ,
˜p1 = p1 − p3,

˜q2 = q2 − q3,
˜p2 = p2 − p3 ,
the expression in the exponent takes the form

(28)

q1p2 − q2p1 + q2p3 − q3p2 + q3p1 − q1p3 = ˜q1 ˜p2 − ˜q2 ˜p1 .

(29)
To calculate the  → 0 limit in the sense of distributions of the Gr¨onewald kernel we
use the well-known expression for the Dirac delta function as the limit of the Gaussian:

(30)

(31)

Here ǫ is either a real or an imaginary number (this formula maybe illustrated, e.g., by
the known limit of the free particle propagator at the zero instant of time:

Then we apply the change of variables in (29) given by the orthogonal rotation

˜q1 =

˜q2 =

x1 + x2√2
x3 + x4√2

, ˜p2 =

, ˜p1 =

x1 − x2√2
x3 − x4√2

.

Thus we get

and for the Gr¨onewald kernel as a function of x1, x2, x3, x4 we get the expression:

Using the limit formula (31) we get for  → 0

K0(x1, x2, x3, x4) = δ(x1)δ(x2)δ(x3)δ(x4) = δ(x),

Here x = (x1, x2, x3, x4). Finally, using the invariance of the Dirac delta function under
orthogonal transformations:

δ(Ox) = δ(x) ,

where O is an orthogonal matrix with determinant one, we get, as desired:

K0(˜q1, ˜p1, ˜q2, ˜p2) = δ(˜q1)δ(˜p1)δ(˜q2)δ(˜p2).

(36)

(37)

Substituting back the initial coordinates (28) we get the pointwise product kernel
K0(q1, p1, q2, p2, q3, p3) = δ(q1 − q3)δ(q2 − q3)δ(p1 − p3)δ(p2 − p3).

Turning back to the quantizer-dequantizer formalism discussed above, the quantizer

for the Moyal star-product scheme with the Planck constant reinserted reads,

(q ˆp − pˆq)(cid:19) exp

and the dequantizer reads,

π

exp(cid:18)−
bD(q, p) =
bU(q, p) = 2 πbD(q, p) .
bU → λbU ,
bD → λ−1bD

Since the kernel is not scale invariant with respect to the transform

while Eq. (9) is, the condition for the Gr¨onewald kernel to give in the limit  = 0 the

pointwise product kernel determines the prefactor −1 for the quantizer bD(q, p) and the
dimensionless prefactor for the dequantizer bU (q, p).
The previous proof of the  → 0 limit of the Gr¨onewald kernel is coherent with the
mentioned classical proof by Thirring [29]. In fact in [29] it was shown that the Weyl
operator ˆW (z) = exp(zˆa† − z∗ˆa) at the limit  → 0 becomes:
ˆW (z−1/2) exp(isˆq1/2) ˆW (−z−1/2) → exp(isq)ˆI ,

(41)

The quantum-to-classical transition: contraction of associative products

where q is the Weyl symbol of the position operator. As it was stated in [29] this
proposition implies the strong convergence to the identity operator multiplied by a c-
number q of the family of operators ˆW (z−1/2)ˆq1/2 ˆW †(z−1/2).

To exhibit a situation where more “classicality” is obtained by means of a limiting
(contraction) procedure, we consider a system of many particles with diﬀerent masses
(e.g., protons and electrons in an atom). The centre of mass in this system moves
according to classical mechanics. The relative motion obviously has quantum behaviour.
Formally it can be explained by introducing the analog of the Wigner-Weyl quantization,
not on phase space (q, p) but on the position-velocity phase space (q, ˙q). Since ˙q = p/m
we have an extra parameter m for any particle. Because the momentum operator
reads as ˆp = −ih∂/∂q the velocity operator contains the ratio /m. One has then
the possibility to consider the large particle mass limit m → ∞, instead of the classical
limit  → 0.

If we write now the star-product of functions f (q, ˙q) for bipartite systems q =

(q1, q2) and ˙q = ( ˙q1, ˙q2), we get:

(f1 ∗ f2) (q, ˙q) =

=Z f1(q(1), ˙q(1))f2(q(2), ˙q(2))K(q(1), ˙q(1), q(2), ˙q(2), q, ˙q) dq(1)d ˙q(1)dq(2)d ˙q(2) .
For classical mechanics the kernel above reads:
K(q(1), ˙q(1), q(2), ˙q(2), q(3), ˙q(3)) = δ(q(1) − q(3))δ(q(2) − q(3))δ( ˙q(1) − ˙q(3))δ( ˙q(2) − ˙q(3)) .
For quantum mechanics the kernel reads

Thus, due to the structure of the kernel we have obtained more “classicality” in the
total system. One degree of freedom is described by a quantum kernel and another one
by a classical kernel, as we argued in the Introduction. We can ﬁnd ﬁrst order quantum
correction to the classical pointwise kernel by expanding Eq. (27) to ﬁrst order in ,
obtaining a correction term to the pointwise classical kernel of the form:

i
2m

[δ′(q3 − q1)δ( ˙q3 − ˙q1)δ(q3 − q2)δ′( ˙q3 − ˙q2)δ(q3 − q1)δ′( ˙q3 − ˙q1)δ′(q3 − q2)δ( ˙q3 − ˙q2)] .
This picture corresponds to the discussion in [28] for the Weyl system described in

Lagrangian terms with the Hessian ∂2L/∂ ˙qi∂ ˙qj being the “mass tensor”.

11

The analogous limit for the tomographic quantum kernel (23) follows from the
relation of the tomographic symbols to Weyl symbols given by the Radon transform.
For a one particle system the classical kernel has the form given by Eq. (23) where
the term ν1µ2 − ν2µ1 has been removed. Whereas for two particles with m1 = 1 and
m2 → ∞ the kernel has a product structure similar to Eq. (44) where the quantum
factor is given by Eq. (23) and the classical factor has the same form as in Eq. (23) but
without the antisymmetric term in the exponent.

3. A simple mathematical formulation for the contraction procedure of
associative algebras

3.1. The general setting

Having already discussed in Sect. 2 some physical arguments behind the contraction
procedure for associative algebras, let us extract the main mathematical ideas of this
limiting procedure.

Let us consider a bilinear product on a vector space V , say B: V × V → V , and a
one-parameter family of invertible linear transformations Tλ: V → V . We may deﬁne a
λ-dependent bilinear product Bλ on V by setting:

Bλ(u, v) = T −1

λ

(B(Tλu, Tλv)) ,

∀u, v ∈ V .

(45)

Then, we can construct the trilinear product, called the associator:

Aλ(u, v, w) = Bλ(Bλ(u, v), w) − Bλ(u, Bλ(v, w)),

∀u, v, w ∈ V ,

(46)

which deﬁnes a (3, 1) tensor on V . This tensor vanishes identically (for all λ) if the
product B is associative, that is, the products Bλ are associative for all λ provided that
B is associative.

It may happen, however, that for a critical value of λ = λc, Tc = Tλc is not invertible,

nevertheless the limit:

lim
λ→λc

T −1
λ (B(Tλ·, Tλ·)) = Bc

(47)

exists. Therefore in this case, as the transformation B → Bc does not arise from an
invertible linear transformation we cannot automatically conclude that the new product
is associative. If it were, then we would say that Bc is the associative bilinear product
obtained by contraction of B with respect to the family Tλ. It is clear that diﬀerent
families Tλ could give rise to the same contraction Bc when applied to B, for instance,
just consider any invertible linear map S: V → V such that B(Su, Sv) = S(B(u, v)),
then the family T ′
λ = Tλ ◦ S, will provide the same contraction Bc applied to B than Tλ.
In the paper by Cari˜nena et al [1] a condition on Tλ was derived, similar to the
Nijenhuis condition for Lie algebras, that would guarantee that such limit, if it exists,
will provide an associative bilinear product.

As we are interested in the classical-to-quantum transition our framework as
discussed before would be, more speciﬁcally, the one of inﬁnite dimensional C ∗-algebras,

The quantum-to-classical transition: contraction of associative products

12

that is, complete normed associative algebras, carrying an antilinear involution ∗ such
that ||a∗a|| = ||a||2 for all elements in the algebra. The self-adjoint elements in any
such algebra, i.e., elements such that a∗ = a, would be intrepreted as observables of a
quantum system.

In such case the limit in Eq. (47), should be taken with respect to the corresponding
topology and in many occasions its computation is far from trivial. For this reason it
would be more convenient to have a diﬀerent approach to describe the contraction
mechanism for associative algebras, that is, we may try to describe the contraction limit
above directly in terms of structure constants or kernels. Actually, as we have seen in
Sect. 2, even if the computation of the limit is performed at the level of kernels, such
computations are more subtle than in the standard, ﬁnite dimensional situation.

Thus we will assume that the associative algebra structure ‘·’ is deﬁned on the
complex linear space V by the bilinear product B, u · v = B(u, v), u, v ∈ V , and we
will assume, for the moment, that there is a linear basis {ei} which allows to write the
associative product in terms of structure constants:

C l

jkel .

(48)

The associativity of the bilinear product requires that the structure constants C j
satisfy the quadratic equations:

mn

C j

mnC k

C j

nlC k

jm .

(49)

ej · ek =Xl

Xj

jl =Xj

Tλ(ej) · Tλ(ek) =Xl

We interpret the invertible maps Tλ as a change of basis ei 7→ Tλ(ei) and, consequently,
in the new basis:

C l

jk(λ)Tλ(el) .

(50)

Xl

In other words, we deﬁne a new product ej ·λ ek implicitly given by:

Tλ(ej ·λ ek) = Tλ(ej) · Tλ(ek) ,

with structure constants C l
critical value λc, we get the expression equivalent to Eq. (47):

jk(λ)el = T −1

jk(λ), that is,Pl C l

(51)
λ (Tλ(ej)· Tλ(ek)) and, for the

C l

jk(λc)el = lim
λ→λc

T −1
λ (Tλ(ej) · Tλ(ek)) .

(52)

As it was pointed out before, whether these resulting structure constants satisfy the
quadratic condition (49) arising from associativity remains to be checked.

However it is not necessary to introduce a linear basis to obtain an explicit
representation of the deformations of an associative product whose limit can be worked
out more easily. As it was shown in the various situations of physical interest in Section
2, a kernel representation provide a convenient setting to perform explicit computations.
Thus, a formal presentation of the contraction method using kernels could be done by

The quantum-to-classical transition: contraction of associative products

13

assuming that V is a nuclear functional space. Then if the associative product ∗ is
described by a continuous bilinear form B, then there will exist a kernel K such that

and the associativity condition for the kernel function K(x1, x2, x) will be expressed as:

(f ∗ g)(x) =Z f (x1)g(x2)K(x1, x2, x) dx1dx2 ,
Z K(x1, x, x4)K(x2, x3, x)dx =Z K(x1, x2, x)K(x, x3, x4) dx ,

(53)

(54)

(55)

(56)

which are the quadratic equations corresponding to Eq. (49). In the particular instance
of a star-product constructed using the quantizer-dequantizer formalism developed in
Section 2.2, we get that the kernel is given by Eq. (16).

Hence a family of continuous isomorphisms Tλ will induce a family of kernels,

B(Tλf, Tλg) =Z f (x1)g(x2)Kλ(x1, x2, x) dx1dx2 ,

and, ﬁnally we will obtain the expression analogous of Eq. (52):

Kc(x1, x2, x) = lim
λ→0

T −1
λ (x)Kλ(x1, x2, x) ,

where the argument x in Tλ indicates that it acts on the x variable of the kernel Kλ.

3.2. K-deformations: A simple example

In all previous contraction procedures a limiting procedure is required, involving a linear
transformation which is not invertible for λ = λc. In this section, we show however that
it is possible to build alternative associative products by a procedure diﬀerent from the

previous deformation argument. Consider for any vector K =Pm K mem the following

product:

ej ·K ek = ej · K · ek .

(57)
It is clear that if the starting product is associative, the new product ·K is associative
too. By selecting a vector K = K(λ) depending on a parameter family λ, we can deﬁne
a procedure that in some cases mimics the reduction procedure above. We will call the
associative structure deﬁned by the product ·K deﬁned in Eq. (57) a K-deformation of
the original associative structure.

We shall elaborate further on this procedure by exhibiting a simple example that

illustrates the previous arguments.

On the three dimensional vector space V = R3 we consider the Lie product:

[x, y] = x ∧ y .

(58)
By using the adjoint representation, we associate a 3 × 3 matrix with any vector. We
denote by L1, L2, L3 the matrices associated to the standard basis of vectors e1, e2, e3,
i..e,

L1 =

0 0
0
0 0 −1
0
0 1

 , L2 =

0 0 1
0 0 0
−1 0 0

 , L3 =

0 −1 0
0 0
1
0
0 0

 .

(59)

The quantum-to-classical transition: contraction of associative products

14

We consider now the standard associative product A· B among matrices in gl(3, R) and
the deformed K-product [30] deﬁned by A ·K B = A · K · B, where K is a 3 × 3 real
matrix that doesn’t need to be a linear combination of L1, L2, L3. By setting K to be:

we get for the commutators [A, B]K = A ·K B − B ·K A:

K =

λ1 µ1 µ3
µ1 λ2 µ2
µ3 µ2 λ3

 ,

[L1, L2]K = µ3L1 + µ2L2 + λ3L3,
[L2, L3]K = λ1L1 + µ1L2 + µ3L3,
[L3, L1]K = µ1L1 + λ2L2 + µ2L3 .

(60)

(61)

(62)

(63)

All unimodular three dimensional Lie algebras are obtained by properly choosing the
parameters appearing in the matrix K. We see that as long as K is invertible, the
matrices of these K-deformed Lie algebras generate the associative algebra gl(3, R).
However when K is not invertible, we get a “contraction” from gl(3, R) to lower
dimensional associative algebras.

On the contrary, if we start with the matrices:

and

0 0 1
0 0 0
0 0 0

X1 =
K =

 , X2 =

 , X3 =

h

 ,

(64)

(65)

the same procedure will provide the remaining family of algebras required to complete
the list provided by Bianchi classiﬁcation of real three-dimensional Lie algebras.
Actually, we get:

[X1, X2]K = 0 ,
[X2, X3]K = (ρ + hα)X1 − νX2 .

[X1, X3]K = −νX1 + (µ − hα)X2

(66)

(67)

Thus we have shown that any contraction of a three-dimensional Lie algebra may

be obtained with our alternative procedure of K-deformations.

3.3. K-deformations and the Gr¨onewald kernel

After the discussion of the simple example before, we may use the K-deformation

mechanism to get the new star-product kernels starting from a given quantizer bD(x)
and dequantizer bU(x), where x is a point of a measure space X or, for that matter, for

any star-product deﬁned by a kernel K.

The quantum-to-classical transition: contraction of associative products

15

Then for any given kernel K and function κ(x) on the manifold we may deﬁne the

new κ-star-product

(f1 ∗ f2)κ(x) = (f1 ∗ κ ∗ f2)(x)

(68)

corresponding to the new kernel

Thus, in the quantizer-dequantizer formalism, Eq. (69), will become:

S(x1, x2, x3) =Z dzdy K(x1, z, x3)K(y, x2, z)κ(y) .
S(x1, x2, x3) =Z dzdy Tr(cid:16)bD(x1)bD(z)bU (x3)(cid:17) Tr(cid:16)bD(y)bD(x2)bU (z)(cid:17) κ(y) . (70)

As two examples of new star-products for functions on the phase-space, i.e., x =
(q, p), where the initial star-product is given by the Gr¨onewald kernel Eq. (26), obtained
using Eq. (69) with functions κ1(q, p) = δ(q)δ(p) and κ2(q, p) = exp(−q2 − p2)/π we
will get the new star-products whose kernels will read respectively as:

(69)

S1(q1, p1, q2, p2, q3, p3) =

1
π2 δ(q1 + q2 − q3)δ(p1 + p2 − p3)e2i(q3p1−p3q1) (71)
exp[−(q1 + q2 − q3)2 − (p1 + p2 − p3)2](cid:19) G(q1, p1, q2, p2, q3, p3)

S2(q1, p1, q2, p2, q3, p3) =(cid:18) 1

π

with G(q1, p1, q2, p2, q3, p3) denoting again Gr¨onewald’s kernel.

Applying this method n times with diﬀerent functions κj(x), j = 1, . . . , n, one
obtains new star-product kernels which depend polynomially on the initial one. It is
worthy to note that applying the same deformation κ1(q, p) = δ(q)δ(p) to the above
kernel S1 we obtain again the same kernel with an extra factor of normalization,
while applying the deformation κ2(q, p) = exp(−q2 − p2)/π to the above kernel S2
we reconstruct the Gr¨onewald’s kernel.

The obtained kernels allow to deﬁne new Lie products and new Jordan products.

This construction will be discussed systematically in the following section.

3.4. Iterated deformations of the associative product

The construction of the deformed K-product ·K can be iterated by using as a starting
associative product ·K itself, thus we would get:

ej ∗K1 ek = ej ·K K1 ·K ek ,

(72)

and so on. This procedure amounts to deﬁne a new product by iteratively using the
expression:

BK(u, v) = B(B(u, K), v) = B(u, B(K, v)) ,

(73)

the second identity on the r.h.s. of previous equation reﬂecting the associativity of the
original product. Iterating the construction gives:

BK1,K(u, v) = BK(BK(u, K1), v) = BK(u, BK(K1, v)) .

(74)

The quantum-to-classical transition: contraction of associative products

16

Clearly, this iteration procedure builds new structure constants in terms of polynomials
of the initial structure constants along with some selected elements K, K1, K2, . . ., in
the vector space V . We will change the notation and denote the vectors in the previous
sequence by K (0), K (1), . . . , and by ·(K0,K1,...) the corresponding iterated products.
mn will be
contained in the new structure constants, say sr
mn, in a polynomial form and therefore
the original quadratic condition on the structure constants gives rise to additional
polynomial conditions again satisﬁed in terms of the original constant structures.

In a more pictorial way, we could say that the old structure constant ar

By using the language of vectors associated with matrices (or with functions in the

group algebra setting), our comments would be spelled out in the following form.

If the structure constants of the original associative product are al

jk, then the

structure constants of the product ·K are given by:

C j

mn(K) =Xsp

as
mpK paj
sn

(75)

If we keep iterating the procedure by using the vectors K (1), K (2), . . ., then we will obtain
that the structure constants for the product ·(K,K1) are given by:

C s

mpK (1)pC j

sn.

(76)

Sj

mn(K (1)) =Xsp

Denoting the structure constants of the iterated product ·(K0,K1,...,Kr) by S(r) (or, S(r)(K)
if we want to emphasize the dependence on the vectors K (s), s = 1, . . . , r) we will have
that they are deﬁned recursively by the sequence:

S(1)j

S(2)j

· · ·· · ·
S(r)j

mn = Xsp
mn = Xsp
mn = Xsp

· · ·· · ·

C s

mpK (1)pC j

sn,

S(1)s

mp K (2)p S(1)j

sn

S(r−1)s

mp K (r)p S(r−1)j

sn

All the structure constants S(r)j

mn satisfy the associativity equation providing even
polynomials equations satisﬁed by the initial constants C j
mn. As we have seen in the
previous subsection, diﬀerent iterations change the Gr¨onewald’s kernel to other kernels
corresponding to diﬀerent kinds of quantization of systems in the framework of phase-
space functions. Correspondingly the antisymmetric part of the structure constants give
polynomial solution of the Jacobi identity, i.e.

mn(K) − S(r)j
satisﬁes the Jacobi identity if the initial C j

mn(K) = S(r)j

L(r)j

nm(K)

Now choosing limits K (1) → K (1)

0 , K (2) → K (2)

mn satisfy the associativity equation.

0 , . . ., we get the contracted star-

product structure constants and contracted Lie-algebra structure constants.

(77)

3.5. Another example: SU(2) contractions

Let us consider ﬁrst the example of the associative algebra associated with the Lie
algebra of the group U(2).

On the four dimensional vector space of the Lie algebra u(2), say R4, with basis

e0, ej, j = 1, 2, 3, we start from

[e0, ej] = 0,

εjklel.

(78)

[ej, ek] = 2Xl

By using the adjoint representation of u(2), we obtain the matrix representation ˆej, of
the generators ej, i.e., (ˆej)kl = 2ε(j)kl, and we obtain the associative product

ˆe0 · ˆe0 = ˆe0,

ˆe0 · ˆej = ˆej,

ˆej · ˆek = δjkˆe0 +Xl

ε l
jk ˆel .

(79)

Now we consider the linear transformation associated with the matrix:

(80)

Tλ =

1 0 0 0
0 λ 0 0
0 0 λ 0
0 0 0 λ



and ﬁnd that we have a new product ˆeµ·λˆeν = T −1

λ

(Tλ(ˆeµ) · Tλ(ˆeν)), µ = 0, 1, 2, 3.

λ

As it was discussed in detail in Section 3 the picture associated with this contraction
procedure is as follows. We start with the binary and bilinear product on a real
four-dimensional vector space V given by Eq. (79) with respect to a given basis ˆeµ,
then we consider the one-parameter family of linear transformations
µ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
Tλ: V → V deﬁned by Eq.
(80) and obtain new structure constants by setting
ˆeµ·λˆeν = T −1
(Tλ(ˆeµ) · Tλ(ˆeν)). For each value of λ 6= 0, Tλ invertible; it turns out that
the new product is isomorphic with the old one and therefore satisﬁes the associativity.
However when Tλ is not invertible but somehow the limit limλ→0 T −1
(Tλ(ˆeµ) · Tλ(ˆeν)))
still exists it is not guaranteed that the limit structure constants still satisfy the
associativity condition. In the previous situation for λ = 0 the transformation is not
invertible, but the limit on the right-hand side exists and gives the structure constants
of a commutative algebra ˆek ·c ˆej = 0, ˆe0 ·c ˆeµ = ˆeµ ·c ˆe0 = ˆeµ.

As in Section 3 we will consider an alternative way to deform products among
matrices and consider these new products as deﬁning contraction procedures. Following
an example studied in [22] we consider the associative so–called K−star–product [11, 30],
with the matrix multiplication rule a◦ b = aKb. In case of 2 × 2−matrices, by choosing
a Hermitian matrix K, we may write

λ

K =  k11 k12

k21 k22 ! =

3Xα=0

sασα

(81)

where the components sα, α = 0, 1, 2, 3, are real, and the σα are the Pauli matrices with
the identity σ0.

The quantum-to-classical transition: contraction of associative products

18

The structure constants, with α = 0, 1, 2, 3, and j, m, n = 1, 2, 3, are:

C α

We may consider a contraction product by steps, ﬁrst k11 → 0, then k22 → 0, then
In a similar fashion we may consider the matrices η0 = σ0, η1 = √µ1µ3σ1, η2 =

k12 → 0 or k21 → 0 to ﬁnally get a contracted star-product.
√µ1µ2σ2, η3 = √µ2µ3σ3 whose products depend on parameters µ1, µ2, µ3 as follows:
η3η1 = −η1η3 = µ3η2
η0ηj = ηj, η0η0 = η0.

η2η3 = −η3η2 = iµ2η1,
η3η3 = µ2µ3η0,

η1η2 = − η2η1 = iµ1η3,
η1η1 = µ1µ3η0,

η2η2 = µ1µ2η0,

For each value of the parameters these products are associative and we may consider
the limit cases with µ1 → 0, then µ2 → 0, and ﬁnally µ3 → 0. Then we will get the
product,

µ1 → 0

µ2 → 0

µ3 → 0

η1η2 = 0,
η1η1 = 0,
η0ηj = ηj,

η2η3 = −η3η2 = iµ2η1,
η2η2 = 0,
η0η0 = η0,

η3η3 = µ2µ3η0

η3η1 = −η1η3 = iµ3η2

η1η2 = 0,
η1η1 = 0,
η0ηj = ηj,

η2η3 = 0,
η2η2 = 0,
η0η0 = η0,

η3η1 = µ3η2
η3η3 = 0

η1η2 = 0,
η1η1 = 0,
η0ηj = ηj,

η2η3 = 0,
η2η2 = 0,
η0η0 = η0.

η3η1 = 0
η3η3 = 0,

This example shows that the limiting procedure may be considered in a higher
dimensional parameter space. This time we start from the observation that for any
matrix K, the row-by-column product among matrices, known to be associative, may
be deformed into new associative products by considering A∗kB = A · K · B which may
be thought of as a homotopic deformation of the initial one A∗λB = A·(I+λ(K− I))·B.
This class of new associative products is isomorphic with the initial one whenever K
is invertible, when K ceases to be invertible we obtain new associative products not
isomorphic to the initial ones.

4. Conclusions

To conclude we summarise the main results of our work. We have considered the
quantum-to-classical transition as a contraction procedure of algebraic structures. To
this aim, we have shown how Wigner-In¨on¨u’s contraction of Lie algebras can be extended
to associative products and we have considered several examples of these situations.

The contraction procedure introduces Abelian subalgebras or pairwise commuting
operators out of non commuting ones. When the contracted algebra may be written
as A ⊗ I + I ⊗ B with A Abelian and B maximally noncommuting, we obtain a
system composed by a “classical” one and a “quantum” one.
Starting with the
associative product coming from the group algebra of the Heisenberg-Weyl group,
we have considered the quantum-to-classical transition, i.e.,  → 0, as a contraction
procedure at the level of “kernel functions”. Thus the contraction method embodies the
phenomena that more “classicality” can be obtained due to the contraction procedure
very much as more “Abelianity” can be obtained as a result of standard contraction
of Lie algebras. We have also discussed the problem of complete and intermediate
“classicality”. This procedure is rather involved, as we have shown in the example
of Weyl systems. We have elaborated on this idea to consider the usual contraction
procedure as a way to generate a transition to the classical regime. In particular, by
using Weyl systems in the Lagrangian formalism [31], we have seen that quantum and
classical aspects may coexist. In particular, we have discussed how a quantum system
containing heavy and light particles, like nuclei and electrons in molecules, may give
rise to classical behaviour of heavy particles in the inﬁnite limit of their masses, coupled
with quantum behaviour of light particles. However a more complete discussion of these
aspects should be considered in forthcoming papers.

Using Ado’s theorem, which tells us that any ﬁnite dimensional Lie algebra
can be realized as a commutator part of a ﬁnite-dimensional matrix algebra, Lie
algebra contraction can be related to the theory of contractions of associative algebras
developed here. Building on previous work, we have shown that the contraction of the
associative algebra gives a contracted associative algebra whose associated Lie algebra
is a contracted Lie algebra of the starting one.

Finally, one of the most important contributions of this work is that by deforming
the associative product with the help of elements in the algebra, what we have called
K-deformations, we are assured that the family of algebras that we deﬁne are always
associative, therefore it is not necessary to verify the analog of Nijenhuis conditions
because they are automatically satisﬁed. Of course we have not shown that all possible
contractions may arise in this way. However the improvement is extremely important
in inﬁnite dimensions because we can avoid dealing with limits in the various topologies
we may deﬁne on the corresponding spaces of operators.

As for applications to ﬁnite level quantum systems, we refer to [15, 16] where the
contraction procedure is related to the semigroup associated with the Kossakowski-
Lindblad Markovian dynamics. This and other applications involving contractions of
