ABSTRACT
We investigate the expected rates and bolometric light-curve properties of stripped-
envelope electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) using stellar models from the Binary
Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) code. We expect that 0.8 per cent (Z =
0.020) and 1.2 per cent (Z = 0.004) of core-collapse supernovae are stripped-envelope
ECSNe. Their typical ejecta masses are estimated to be 0.3 M⊙ (Z = 0.020) and
0.7 M⊙ (Z = 0.004). Assuming ECSN explosion properties from numerical explosion
simulations, the explosion energy of 1.5 × 1050 erg and the 56Ni mass of 2.5 × 10−3 M⊙,
we ﬁnd that stripped-envelope ECSNe have a typical rise time of around 10 days and
peak luminosity of around 8 × 1040 erg s−1 (−13.6 mag). Their typical ejecta velocities
are around 7000 km s−1 (Z = 0.020) and 4000 km s−1 (Z = 0.004). Thus, stripped-
envelope ECSNe are observed as rapidly-evolving faint transients with relatively small
velocities. SN 2008ha-like supernovae which are the faintest kind of SN 2002cx-like
(a.k.a. Type Iax) supernovae may be related to stripped-envelope ECSNe.

1 INTRODUCTION

Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are mostly the result of the
collapse of an iron core. Stars must be massive enough to
form such cores to give rise to such an event which is thought
to be around 8 to 10 M⊙ (Smartt 2015). Stars just below
this mass in which nuclear burning progresses only to form
an ONeMg core may also eventually collapse and produce a
SN due to electron-capture reactions (e.g. Miyaji et al. 1980;
Nomoto 1984, 1987). These kind of SNe are called electron-
capture SNe (ECSNe). Numerical simulations of ECSNe
have revealed that they explode with an explosion energy
of ∼ 1050 erg and synthesize ∼ 10−3 M⊙ of radioactive 56Ni
(e.g. Kitaura, Janka, & Hillebrandt 2006).

The canonical progenitor model

for an ECSN is a
single star that has evolved to the super-asymptotic gi-
ant branch (super-AGB) (e.g. Eldridge & Tout 2004; Siess
2007; Eldridge, Mattila & Smartt 2007; Poelarends et al.
2008; Takahashi, Yoshida, & Umeda 2013; Jones et al. 2013;
Doherty et al. 2015). Super-AGB stars contain H-rich enve-
lope of the order of several M⊙ with an ONeMg core sup-
ported by electron degeneracy pressure. They are otherwise
similar in structure to normal AGB stars that have a CO
core. Any ECSNe from super-AGB stars are presumed to be

observed as Type II SNe (Tominaga, Blinnikov, & Nomoto
2013). Super-AGB stars are also expected to have large
mass-loss rates making dense circumstellar media (e.g.
Poelarends et al. 2008; Woosley & Heger 2015). Thus, EC-
SNe from super-AGB stars are likely to show signatures of
the interaction between SN ejecta and dense circumstellar
media (e.g. Smith 2013; Moriya et al. 2014).

However, recent evidence has begun to show that most
stars are in fact in binary systems (Sana et al. 2012, 2013).
It shows that maybe 50 to 70 per cent of stars have their evo-
lution aﬀected by binary interactions. It has been suggested
that duplicity of a star will aid it’s evolution to an ECSN
(Nomoto 1985; Podsiadlowski et al. 2004). ECSNe from bi-
nary systems can have a profoundly diﬀerent observational
properties from those from single stars. For example, most
single ECSN progenitors have a H-rich envelope for their
core to grow, and they mostly explode as Type II SNe. This
is not necessarily true for ECSNe from binary systems and,
as we show below, many ECSNe with little or no remaining
hydrogen (stripped-envelope ECSNe) are predicted to exist.
In this Letter, we investigate observational properties of
stripped-envelope ECSNe based on binary population syn-
thesis models from the Binary Population and Spectral Syn-
thesis (BPASS) code1 (Eldridge et al. in preparation). We

take the predicted stellar properties of stripped-envelope
ECSN progenitors from BPASS and investigate observa-
tional properties, namely, event rates and bolometric light
curves (LCs), of stripped-envelope ECSNe.

We ﬁrst introduce the binary population synthesis mod-
els and discuss ECSN rates and stripped-envelope ECSN
progenitor properties in Section 2. Then, we discuss expected
stripped-envelope ECSN LC properties in Section 3. We fur-
ther discuss stripped-envelope ECSN properties and possi-
ble observational candidates in Section 4. We conclude this
Letter in Section 5.

2 PROGENITOR PROPERTIES

2.1 Binary population synthesis model

The Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis, BPASS,
code was ﬁrst discussed in Eldridge, Izzard & Tout (2008)
which also outlines modiﬁcations to the Cambridge STARS
code used to create the stellar evolution models. These mod-
els are a large grid of 250,000 detailed stellar models that
allow us to investigate the rich diversity of the evolution of
interacting binary stars. The use of detailed models allows
us to accurately follow how the stellar envelope responds to
mass loss – key to determining the eventual mass and fate
of the star. There are many groups that study binary evo-
lution of massive stars and its importance for massive stars
is review by e.g. Vanbeveren & Mennekens (2015).

We have recently released version 2.0 of BPASS (El-
dridge et al. in preparation). This incorporates many reﬁne-
ments to the code and its outputs compared to the earlier
versions. The results of BPASS v2.0 have already demon-
strated the improvement in agreement between observations
and stellar population models that arises from the inclusion
of interacting binaries (e.g.
Stanway, Eldridge & Becker
2016; Woﬀord et al. 2016). A full description of BPASS is be-
yond the scope of this letter and here we present a summary
of the main parameters. We use an initial-mass function
based on Kroupa, Tout, & Gilmore (1993), with a power-
law slope of −1.3 between initial masses of 0.1 to 0.5 M⊙
and a slope of −2.35 from 0.5 to 300 M⊙. This is combined
with an initial-mass ratio of M2/M1 that is uniformly dis-
tributed between 0 to 1. All secondary stars contribute to
the stellar mass but we do not include a companion in the
stellar mass estimate if its initial mass is less than 0.1 M⊙.
The initial-period distribution is uniformly distributed in log
of the period from 1 day to 104 days. These are consistent
with the observed distributions of Sana et al. (2012).

In this study we use only two of the metallicities avail-
able, Z = 0.020 which is suitable for Solar type metallicity
and Z = 0.004 for low metallicity environments like the
Small Magellanic Cloud. We select out ECSN progenitors
using the mass ranges of Woosley & Heger (2015) for the
CO core mass. If the star has experienced core carbon burn-
ing, has a CO core mass between 1.38 and 1.4 M⊙ and a
total stellar mass greater than 1.5 M⊙ we assume it will
experience an ECSN. If the masses are below this limit a
white dwarf will be formed, above these masses a normal
core-collapse SN is assumed to occur.

The channels for the ECSNe are similar at both metal-
licities. The initial mass range of the progenitors at Z =

0.020 ranges from 4 to 12 M⊙. The more massive stars in
this mass range tend to experience Case A mass transfer
becoming less massive and experience a second binary inter-
action after core helium burning, Case BB interactions. Less
massive stars in this mass range tend to experience a stellar
merger and so are single at the time of the ECSN but are
the result of binary evolution. The initial periods of these
orbits are shorter than a few days.

The main channel however comes from stars in the mass
range of 7 to 10 M⊙ with initial orbits in the range of 10 to
a few 100 days. Here they have Case B mass transfer, after
the hydrogen burning main sequence. Therefore removing
the hydrogen envelope but still evolving to core-collapse as
suggested by Podsiadlowski et al. (2004). We also note that
ECSNe can also occur for the secondary star in a binary.
We ﬁnd cases where a progenitor in the mass range of 7 to
10 M⊙ also experience an ECSN where their mass has been
lost via an interaction with a white dwarf, neutron star or
black hole. At the lower metallicities these mass ranges are
lower by 1 or 2 M⊙ but the evolutionary channels are the
same.

We note that our models are similar to those recently
discussed by Tauris, Langer & Podsiadlowski (2015). How-
ever here many of our progenitor models arise from the pri-
mary star rather than the secondary star as suggested by
those authors.

2.2 Stripped-envelope ECSN progenitor

properties

Table 1 summarizes predicted fractions of ECSNe from
BPASS. The total ECSN fractions in core-collapse SNe are
1.5 per cent for Z = 0.020 and 8.6 per cent for Z = 0.004.
Smaller mass loss in lower metallicity likely make the ECSN
fraction larger in lower metallicity.

We further show expected SN-type fractions of EC-
SNe in Table 1. We classify ECSNe from progenitors with
a remaining hydrogen mass less than 0.5 M⊙ as stripped-
envelope ECSNe (Type IIb and Type I) and the others as
Type II. The choice of 0.5 M⊙ is arbitrary. Type IIb SNe
are typically estimated to have hydrogen masses of the or-
der of 0.1 M⊙ (e.g. Woosley et al. 1994). We ﬁnd that 51
per cent of ECSN progenitors at Z = 0.020 are stripped-
envelope ECSNe and the fraction reduces to 14 per cent at
Z = 0.004. However, the stripped-envelope ECSN fractions
in core-collapse SNe are higher at Z = 0.004 (1.2 per cent)
than at Z = 0.020 (0.8 per cent) because of the lower total
ECSN fraction in higher metallicity.

We divide stripped-envelope ECSNe into two diﬀerent
subtypes, Type IIb and Type I. Those with hydrogen mass
between 0.5 M⊙ and 0.01 M⊙ are classiﬁed as Type IIb and

the others as Type I. The majority of stripped-envelope EC-
SNe are Type I. We do not sub-classify Type I here. Whether
Type I SNe are classiﬁed as Type Ib or Ic depends on the de-
gree of 56Ni mixing (e.g. Dessart et al. 2012). All the Type I
ECSNe we obtain have helium masses of more than 0.06 M⊙,
which is the maximum amount of helium that can be hid-
den (Hachinger et al. 2012). Thus, if suﬃcient 56Ni mixing
occurs, Type I ECSNe can be observed as Type Ib SNe.

Because the explosion energy (Eej) and the 56Ni mass
(M56 Ni) are expected to vary little between ECSNe, the
ejecta mass (Mej) is the most inﬂuential parameter de-
termining the LC properties of stripped-envelope ECSNe.
Figure 1 shows the ejecta mass distributions of stripped-
envelope ECSNe from BPASS. A typical ejecta mass of
stripped-envelope ECSNe is expected to be of the order of
0.1 M⊙. The average ejecta mass increases as the metallic-
ity decreases because of weaker stellar wind mass loss at low
metallicity.

CURVES

3.1 Method

We obtain bolometric LCs of stripped-envelope ECSNe by
using a simpliﬁed analytic method introduced by Arnett
(1982). This simpliﬁed model has been used to obtain
bolometric LCs of stripped-envelope SNe where the eﬀect
of hydrogen recombination in opacity is negligible (e.g.
Valenti et al. 2008; Chatzopoulos, Wheeler, & Vinko 2012;
Inserra et al. 2013). Brieﬂy, we numerically evaluate the fol-
lowing equation to obtain the bolometric luminosity L at
time t after the explosion,

3.2 Results

Figure 2 presents bolometric LCs of stripped-envelope EC-
SNe. All possible LCs obtained from all stripped-envelope
ECSN progenitors in BPASS are shown. Figure 3 shows the
expected distributions of their peak luminosity and rise time
in which the probability distribution from the BPASS model
is taken into account.

The typical rise time of stripped-envelope ECSN LCs is
about 7 days (Z = 0.020) and 12 days (Z = 0.004) which
are much shorter than typical stripped-envelope SNe (e.g.
Drout et al. 2011; Taddia et al. 2015b; Lyman et al. 2016).
The rise time is generally shorter in the higher metallicity
model because of the smaller ejecta mass (Figure 1). The
peak luminosity of stripped-envelope ECSNe is very faint be-
cause of their small 56Ni mass. Their typical peak luminosity
is expected to be around 8 × 1040 erg s−1 (−13.6 mag) for
both metallicities, although the Z = 0.020 stripped-envelope
ECSNe are slightly brighter by about 0.1 mag. After reach-
ing the peak luminosity, the LCs decline very rapidly with a
similar timescale to their rise without following the nuclear
energy deposition. This is because the small ECSN ejecta
masses cause ineﬃcient gamma-ray trapping and gamma-
rays from the nuclear decay cannot heat the ejecta to a great
amount.

There are several caveats in our simpliﬁed LC model.
First, we have ﬁxed Eej in our model which can mainly aﬀect
the rise time. However, as the rise time is roughly propor-
tional to κe(M 3
ej/Eej)4 (Arnett 1982), a small variation in
Eej has little eﬀect on the rise time compared to Mej. We
also ﬁxed M56 Ni which mainly changes the peak luminos-
ity. If there is a factor of a few diversities in M56 Ni, the
diversity in the peak luminosity would also be a factor of a
few (about 1 mag). However, stripped-envelope ECSNe still
remain to be very faint transients. We have also ﬁxed the
electron-scattering opacity to 0.1 cm2 g−1, although this is
likely a good approximation (e.g. Inserra et al. 2013). The
electron-scattering opacity may vary especially in those pro-
genitors with a relatively large hydrogen mass (blue LCs in
Figure 2). Overall, although there are several uncertainties
in our LC model due to simplicity, we expect that general
LC properties we obtain in this section remain unchanged
even if we take some complexity into account.

4 DISCUSSION

The faintest kind of Type I SNe currently known are
SN 2008ha-like SNe which have peak luminosity of around
−14 mag and rise times of around 10 days (e.g. SN 2008ha,
Foley et al. 2009, 2010, 2016; Valenti et al. 2009; SN 2010ae,
Stritzinger et al. 2014). SN 2008ha-like SNe are often re-
garded as a sub-class of SN 2002cx-like (Type Iax) SNe
(Foley et al. 2013) and related to partial disruption of white
dwarfs (e.g. Kromer et al. 2015). We ﬁnd that bolometric
LCs of stripped-envelope ECSNe are consistent with those
of SN 2008ha-like SNe. Assuming typical ejecta masses of
0.2 M⊙ (Z = 0.020) and 0.7 M⊙ (Z = 0.004), we obtain
the typical ejecta velocities of 7000 km s−1 (Z = 0.020)
and 4000 km s−1 (Z = 0.004). Small photospheric veloci-
ties of SN 2008ha-like SNe are consistent with these esti-
mates, particularly in the low metallicity progenitors. Es-
pecially, the estimated explosion properties for SN 2010ae

where κe is an electron-scattering opacity in SN ejecta, c
is the speed of light, and β ≃ 13.8 (Arnett 1982). The
electron-scattering opacity is assumed to be 0.1 cm2 g−1.
The deposition function D approximately takes the gamma-
ray trapping eﬃciency in SN ejecta into account. It is evalu-
ated as in Arnett (1982) by assuming the gamma-ray opacity
of 0.03 cm2 g−1 (e.g. Colgate, Petschek, & Kriese 1980).

Both one- and two-dimensional numerical explosion
simulations of ECSNe consistently show that their ex-
plosion energy and 56Ni mass are ∼ 1050 erg and
∼ 10−3 M⊙, respectively (Kitaura, Janka, & Hillebrandt
2006; Burrows, Dessart, & Livne 2007; Wanajo et al. 2009;
Wanajo, Janka, M¨uller 2011). Thus, the LC diversity of
stripped-envelope ECSNe mostly come from the diversity
in Mej (Fig. 1). We take Mej from the population synthesis
model and ﬁx Eej = 1.5 × 1050 erg and M56 Ni = 2.5 ×
10−3 M⊙ in our LC calculations (Wanajo, Janka, M¨uller
2011).

(Eej ∼ 1050 erg, Mej ∼ 0.1 M⊙, and M56 Ni ∼ 10−3 M⊙;
Stritzinger et al. 2014) match to stripped-envelope ECSNe.
A possible red source at the position of SN 2008ha may
be a companion star of an ECSN progenitor (Foley et al.
2014). Pumo et al. (2009) has connected SN 2008ha to EC-
SNe in the context of single-star evolution model, but we
have shown that stripped-envelope ECSNe can be naturally
obtained from binary evolution.

Spectra of SN 2008ha-like SNe are characterized by
features of intermediate-mass elements (Foley et al. 2009,
2010; Stritzinger et al. 2014). In principle, spectral features
from intermediate-mass elements can be observed in explo-
sions of ONeMg cores. Enhanced production of Ca which
has strong signals in SN 2008ha-like SNe is also predicted
(Wanajo, Janka, M¨uller 2013). Currently, spectral modeling
of stripped-envelope ECSNe is lacking. We need to inves-
tigate spectral properties of stripped-envelope ECSNe and
make proper comparisons with SN 2008ha-like SNe and
other faint and rapid transients.

Both SN 2008ha and SN 2010ae are found in low metal-
licity environments which are close to that of the Large
Magellanic Cloud (Foley et al. 2009; Stritzinger et al. 2014).
They also appear in star-forming galaxies and have small de-
lay time (Foley et al. 2014). We ﬁnd that stripped-envelope
ECSN rates are higher in lower metallicity environments,
and this can explain the preference of SN 2008ha-like SNe
appearing in low metallicity environments. An interesting
prediction from the population synthesis model is that we
expect much more Type II ECSNe in lower metallicity en-
vironment (Table 1). If SN 2008ha-like SNe are stripped-
envelope ECSNe, Type II ECSNe have also likely been de-
tected already. It is interesting to note that Type IIn-P SNe
which are suggested to be ECSNe (e.g. Kankare et al. 2012;
Mauerhan et al. 2013) may also prefer lower metallicity en-
vironments (Taddia et al. 2015a), and they may correspond
to Type II ECSNe we predict to exist.

Although SN 2002cx-like SNe share some common prop-
erties, they also have diversities (Foley et al. 2013). Most of
them are likely related to explosions or eruptions of white
dwarfs, but some of them, especially the faintest ones like
SN 2008ha, may be related to ECSNe as we suggest here. It
is also interesting to note that Jones et al. (2016) recently
argue that oxygen deﬂagration in ONeMg cores may actually
result in partial disruption of the ONeMg cores. In addition,
massive stars other than ECSN progenitors can also end
up with rapidly-evolving faint transients (e.g. Tauris et al.
2013; Moriya et al. 2010). Further LC and spectral mod-
eling of stripped-envelope ECSNe are required to identify
transients corresponding to stripped-envelope ECSNe.

Finally it is also tempting to compare these LCs to
the rapidly evolving transients found by Drout et al. (2014).
While our predicted rate of a few per cent are similar to that
of these objects, the luminosities here are fainter than those
found in this population.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that stripped-envelope ECSNe can be
observed as rapidly-evolving faint transients. ECSNe are
mostly considered to be explosions of super-AGB stars, but
stripped-envelope ECSNe can occur especially from binary

systems. The binary population synthesis model from the
BPASS code predict that ECSN fractions in core-collapse
SNe are 1.5 per cent (Z = 0.020) and 8.6 per cent (Z =
0.004). Among ECSNe, 51 per cent (Z = 0.020) and 14
per cent (Z = 0.004) are predicted to be stripped-envelope
ECSNe (Table 1). Stripped-envelope ECSNe typically have
ejecta masses of 0.3 M⊙ (Z = 0.020) and 0.7 M⊙ (Z = 0.004)
(Figure 1).

(Eej = 1.5 × 1050 erg and M56 Ni = 2.5 × 10−3 M⊙),
we ﬁnd that stripped-envelope ECSNe typically have the
rise time of around 10 days and the peak luminosity of
around 8 × 1041 erg s−1 (Figures 2 and 3). Assuming the
typical ejecta masses, we ﬁnd typical ejecta velocities of
7000 km s−1 (Z = 0.020) and 4000 km s−1 (Z = 0.004).

Expected LC properties and ejecta velocities are con-
sistent with those of SN 2008ha-like SNe. The stripped-
envelope ECSN model can explain the preference of
SN 2008ha-like SNe to occur in low metallicity environ-
ments. The possible red source detected at the location of
SN 2008ha can be a companion star of a stripped-envelope
ECSN progenitor. There has not been spectral modeling of
stripped-envelope ECSNe and it is required to identify them
and determine if they match SN 2008ha-like SNe or other
transients.
