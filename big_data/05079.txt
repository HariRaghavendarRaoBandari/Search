Quantum steering is observed when performing appropriate local measurements on an entangled state. Here
we discuss the possibility of simulating classically this effect, using classical communication instead of en-
tanglement. We show that inﬁnite communication is necessary for exactly simulating steering for any pure
entangled state, as well as for a class of mixed entangled states. Moreover, we discuss the communication
cost of steering for general entangled states, as well as approximate simulation. Our ﬁndings reveal striking
differences between Bell nonlocality and steering, and provide a natural way of measuring the strength of the
latter.

The concept of steering, ﬁrst introduced by Schr¨odinger [1],
was recently put on ﬁrm grounds in a quantum information-
theoretic setting [2].
It describes the following genuinely
quantum effect: consider an experiment with two distant ob-
servers, Alice and Bob, sharing an entangled quantum state.
By performing a local measurement on her subsystem, Al-
ice can remotely steer the quantum state of the system held
by Bob. Quantum steering thus elegantly captures the cele-
brated “spooky action at a distance” discovered by Einstein-
Podolsky-Rosen, and represents a fundamental form of nonlo-
cality in quantum theory, intermediate between entanglement
and Bell nonlocality [2, 5]. It can be detected via the viola-
tion of so-called steering inequalities [3] (analogous to Bell
inequalities), and experimental demonstrations have been re-
ported [4]. Moreover, steering is directly connected to mea-
surement incompatibility [6, 7], and offers applications in
quantum information theory [8, 9].

In order to gain insight into this strikingly counter-intuitive
aspect of quantum theory, it is relevant to discuss quantum
steering from the perspective of more general nonlocal re-
sources. While the observation of steering (e.g. via viola-
tion of a steering inequality) rules out any explanation based
on purely classical correlations (local resources), one may ask
whether the use of an additional nonlocal resource, such as
classical communication, could explain the phenomenon. In
particular, it is then relevant to ask how much classical com-
munication would be required in order to perfectly reproduce
quantum steering.

The goal of the present is precisely to explore these ques-
tions. Speciﬁcally, we discuss the communication cost of
quantum steering, i.e., the minimal amount of classical com-
munication required for reproducing the statistics of a given
quantum steering experiment, without using any entangle-
ment. The communication cost will generally depend on
which entangled state is considered, and which measurements
are performed. We believe that this provides a natural way
of measuring the strength of quantum steering, complemen-
tary to previously introduced measures [9–11]. Moreover, this
measure allows for a direct comparison of steering with other
notions of nonlocality in quantum theory, in particular with
Bell nonlocality [12, 13]. Indeed, the communication cost of
simulating Bell nonlocal quantum correlations has received

much attention [14–20].

Here we show that the communication cost of perfectly
simulating the steering of any pure entangled state, consider-
ing all possible projective measurements, is inﬁnite. Interest-
ingly, this is in strong contrast with the case of Bell nonlocal-
ity where few bits of communication sufﬁce in several cases.
For instance, the statistics of projective measurements on a
two-qubit maximally entangled state can be simulated using
only one bit of communication [18]. Then, we develop a gen-
eral method for lower-bounding the communication cost of
an arbitrary quantum steering experiment. Finally we discuss
the communication cost of approximately simulating steering
experiments, and conclude with some open questions.

Scenario.— Consider a game with two distant players, Al-
ice and Bob, sharing a quantum state AB. The players want
to convince a referee that the state they share is entangled (see
Fig.1). In order to do so, the referee will perform the follow-
ing test. He will ask Alice to perform a measurement x on
her half of the state, and announce its result a, while Bob is
asked to send his subsystem to the referee. Then, by perform-
ing tomography over many instances of the game, the referee
can characterize the conditional (unnormalised) state of Bob’s
subsystem, which is given by

(cid:2)AB (Ma|x ⊗ 11)(cid:3) ,

σa|x = trA

(1)

where Ma|x denotes the POVM element (effect operator) of
Alice corresponding to the outcome a of the measurement
setting x. The collection σ = {σa|x} of conditional states
σa|x = p(a|x) a|x is termed an assemblage; here p(a|x) =
tr[σa|x] and a|x is a normalised quantum state. Importantly,
one should enforce that Alice and Bob cannot communicate
during the game (e.g. by ensuring space-like separation).

Recently, Wiseman et al. [2] discussed the above game in
an information-theoretic setting, and showed formally how the
referee can ensure that the players do indeed share entangle-
ment. Speciﬁcally, they characterised the most general cheat-
ing strategy, referred to as a local hidden state (LHS) model.
Consider the case in which Alice and Bob do not share an en-
tangled state, but only classical correlations (or equivalently
a separable quantum state) represented by a shared classi-
cal variable λ. Upon receiving measurement setting x from

(cid:90)

the referee, Alice provides an outcome a according to a re-
sponse function p(a|x, λ). At the same time, Bob sends a
(normalised) quantum state λ (unentangled to Alice) to the
referee. With such a strategy, the assemblage prepared for the
referee by Alice and Bob necessarily has the form

(2)

σa|x =

dλ µ(λ) p(a|x, λ) λ,

variable λ, i.e. (cid:82) dλ µ(λ) = 1. Assemblages of the above

where µ(λ) represents the probability density of the shared

form are said to admit a LHS model. Therefore, if the assem-
blage held by the referee has a LHS model, he will not be con-
vinced that Alice and Bob do indeed share entanglement, and
Alice and Bob thus loose the game. On the contrary, if the ref-
eree can certify that the assemblage cannot be decomposed as
above, he concludes that Alice and Bob share entanglement,
and thus they win the game.

Interestingly, while entanglement is clearly necessary in or-
der to demonstrate steering (i.e. win the game), it is in gen-
eral not sufﬁcient. That is, there exist entangled states for
which Alice and Bob can never win the game, as the state
admits a LHS model. For any possible measurement per-
formed by Alice, the corresponding assemblage can be per-
fectly reproduced using only shared classical variables. This
was ﬁrst demonstrated when the referee only asks Alice to
perform projective measurements, and recently extended to
general POVMs. More generally, this line of research aims at
understanding the relation between various forms of quantum
correlations.

In the present work, we consider LHS models augmented
by classical communication between Alice and Bob. In other
words, we consider more general cheating strategies. This
scenario is motivated in various ways. First, classical com-
munication represents the most natural classical resource for
obtaining nonlocality. Hence, the minimal amount of classi-
cal communication required to reproduce a quantum assem-
blage provides a natural measure of the strength of steering.
Moreover, as this approach has a long history of studies in the
context of Bell nonlocality, it offers a natural way of quantita-
tively comparing quantum steering and Bell nonlocality.

More formally, we consider the following cheating strate-
gies. First, note that only communication from Alice to Bob
is relevant, as the one from Bob to Alice is a free operation
for steering, therefore useless to fake steering using unsteer-
able assemblages [11]. So, upon receiving her measurement
setting x from the referee, Alice is now allowed to send a clas-
sical message m of t bits to Bob. This allows Bob to send a
(normalised) quantum state m,λ to the referee, having now
partial (or complete) knowledge about x.

where q(m|x, λ) is the probability for Alice to send m given
setting x and shared variable λ. Clearly, LHS assemblages
represent a subclass of the above ones.

Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the cheating strategies
we consider reproduce both the conditional quantum states
a|x of Bob and the local statistics p(a|x) of Alice.

Quantum states with inﬁnite communication cost.— We
ﬁrst show the communication cost of steering is inﬁnite for
any pure entangled bipartite state. More precisely, we show
the following:
Result 1. Consider that Alice and Bob share an arbitrary
bipartite pure entangled state (of any dimension) and Alice
performs local projective (rank-1) measurements. The result-
ing assemblage cannot be simulated using a LHS model aug-
mented with ﬁnite communication; the length t of the trans-
mitted message m must be inﬁnite, i.e. t = ∞.
Proof. For clarity, we will detail the proof for the case of a
two-qubit entangled state, |ψθ(cid:105) = cos θ |00(cid:105) + sin θ |11(cid:105), with
0 < θ ≤ π/4. We consider arbitrary projective qubit mea-
surements on Alice’s side, hence we identify the measurement
label x with unit Bloch vectors ˆx. The corresponding projec-
tors are {Π0|ˆx, Π1|ˆx}, with Πa|ˆx = |φa|ˆx(cid:105)(cid:104)φa|ˆx|. Using Eq.
(1) we obtain that

σa|ˆx = trA(|φa|ˆx(cid:105)(cid:104)φa|ˆx| ⊗ 11|ψθ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψθ|)

= p(a|ˆx)|Φa|ˆx(cid:105)(cid:104)Φa|ˆx|

(4)
where p(a|ˆx) = tr(|φa|ˆx(cid:105)(cid:104)φa|ˆx| ⊗ 11|ψθ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψθ|), and |Φa|ˆx(cid:105) =

(cid:104)φa|ˆx| ⊗ 11|ψθ(cid:105)/(cid:112)p(a|ˆx) is the steered state. First, note that

Eq. (4) shows that σa|ˆx is proportional to a rank-1 projector.
Second, the measurement setting runs over all possible Bloch
vectors, hence it follows that the steered states |Φa|ˆx(cid:105) run over
all the possible pure qubit states.

Now, the most general assemblage that can be generated us-
ing an LHS model augmented with classical communication
takes the form (3). Then, since the target assemblage consists
of pure states and µ(λ) q(m|ˆx, λ) ≥ 0 for all m, λ, each m,λ
must be the same rank-1 projector, i.e. for each a and ˆx,
m,λ = |Φa|ˆx(cid:105)(cid:104)Φa|ˆx|∀ m, λ s.t. µ(λ) q(m|ˆx, λ) > 0.

(5)

(a)Ref(b)Ref(c)RefRecall furthermore that λ is independent of ˆx, having been
distributed before Alice learns ˆx from the referee, and con-
sider a particular value λ∗ which occurs with non-zero proba-
bility. If a message m of any ﬁnite length t is sent from Alice
to Bob, then there are at most 2t distinct pure states m,λ∗
(for each λ∗) that Bob can send to the referee. However, we
already noted that the states |Φa|ˆx(cid:105)(cid:104)Φa|ˆx| in the target assem-
blage run over inﬁnitely many pure states. Therefore, no ﬁnite
length message can reproduce the target assemblage. The ex-
tension to higher dimension uses the same argument (although
note that the inputs are not described by Bloch vectors any
more) and is straightforward.

A natural question following from the above, is to ask
whether the communication cost of steering for more general
entangled states, not only pure entangled states, could be in-
ﬁnite. Our second result is to show that indeed there exist
mixed entangled states that also have inﬁnite communication
cost.
Result 2. Consider that Alice and Bob’s shared state is the
(cid:80)
(normalised) projector onto the anti-symmetric subspace of
2 (11 −
two qudits, anti
ij |ij(cid:105)(cid:104)ji|), and that Alice performs local projective (rank-
1) measurements. The resulting assemblage cannot be sim-
ulated using a LHS model augmented with ﬁnite communi-
cation; the length t of the transmitted message m must be
inﬁnite, i.e. t = ∞.
Proof. Let us denote the projectors of the (arbitrary) measure-
ment of Alice Πa|ˆx = |φa|ˆx(cid:105)(cid:104)φa|ˆx|. Using Eq. (1) with anti
we obtain

= 2Ad/d(d − 1), where Ad = 1

d

d

σa|ˆx = 1

d(d−1) (11 − |φa|ˆx(cid:105)(cid:104)φa|ˆx|)

(6)

which has the property that each steered state of Bob is or-
thogonal to the measurement direction |φa|ˆx(cid:105) of Alice. Since
the measurement settings ˆx of Alice run over all projective
measurements (i.e. bases), she can ensure that Bob’s state is
orthogonal to one of the states in any given basis.

Again, the most general assemblage that can be generated
using an LHS model augmented with classical communica-
tion takes the form (3).
It follows that each m,λ must be
orthogonal to the same rank-1 projector, i.e. for each a and ˆx,
(cid:104)φa|ˆx|m,λ|φa|ˆx(cid:105) = 0∀ m, λ s.t. µ(λ) q(m|ˆx, λ) > 0.
Identically to before, λ is independent of ˆx. If a message m
of any ﬁnite length t is sent from Alice to Bob, then there
are at most 2t distinct pure states m,λ (for each λ) that Bob
can send to the referee. However, we already noted that the
states |φa|ˆx(cid:105) in the target assemblage to which Bob’s simu-
lated states need to be orthogonal run over inﬁnitely many
states. Therefore, since no ﬁnite set of states can be orthog-
onal to all states, no ﬁnite length message can reproduce the
target assemblage.

(7)

As a side remark complementing above results, note that
inﬁnite communication is always sufﬁcient to simulate any
assemblage with a straightforward strategy. Alice outputs a
according to p(a|ˆx). She then sends the classical message

3

m = (ˆx, a) to Bob, who then prepares and forwards a|ˆx to
the referee.

Notably, Results 1 and 2 show that the communication costs
of quantum steering and of quantum nonlocality are totally
different. In particular, while the communication cost of steer-
ing is inﬁnite for any pure entangled two-qubit state, few bits
of communication of enough in the context of nonlocality.
Speciﬁcally, the statistics of local projective measurements on
a maximally entangled state can be reproduced with a single
bit of communication [18], while two bits are enough for par-
tially entangled states [18]. For higher dimensional states, it
was shown that two bits of communication sufﬁce to repro-
duce the correlations of dichotomic measurements on any bi-
partite entangled states [20]. Nevertheless, it is known that
the statistics of general measurements on d × d maximally
entangled states, require an amount of communication that in-
creases (at least) as O(d) [15].

It is also worth making a connection to entanglement the-
ory. The certiﬁcation of entanglement can be recast in the
setting of Fig. 1, by demanding now that Alice also sends a
quantum state to the Referee (similarly to Bob). In this case,
even inﬁnite communication will not help the players, since
entanglement cannot be created by LOCC, i.e.
local opera-
tions assisted by an arbitrary amount of (possibly two-way)
classical communication. An analogy can be drawn to semi-
quantum games [23] (where players receive quantum inputs)
for which it was also demonstrated that inﬁnite communica-
tion can never replace an entangled state [24].

These results further conﬁrm that steering can be consid-
ered a form of quantum nonseparability which is intermediate
between entanglement and Bell nonlocality.

Communication cost for arbitrary assemblages.— A natu-
ral question following the above, is to discuss the communi-
cation cost of steering for more general entangled states. In
particular, one may expect such cost to be ﬁnite for entangled
states which are of full rank. To discuss this point, we provide
a method for placing a lower bound on the communication
cost for simulating an arbitrary assemblage, considering an
arbitrary (but ﬁnite) number of measurements.
Result 3. Consider the steering scenario where Alice steers
Bob. Suppose that they want to reproduce exactly an arbi-
trary assemblage σ. Then, the length t of the message is lower
bounded by

t ≥ log2[ν(σ) + 1] .

(8)

Here ν(σ) is a quantiﬁer of steering termed the LHS robust-
ness, deﬁned as the minimum µ ∈ R≥0 such that the assem-
blage

σ∗ =

1

1 + µ

σ +

µ

1 + µ

˜σ

(9)

is an LHS assemblage, with ˜σ any LHS assemblage.

We note that the LHS robustness ν is a variant of a quanti-

ﬁer introduced in [9], and it is a steering monotone [11].

Proof of Result 3. Let us suppose that σ can be simulated with
a protocol using a message of length t. The strategy of the

proof is to show that this implies that the assemblage

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

σ∗ =

1
2t σ +

(10)

is unsteerable for an unsteerable ˜σ. Rewriting Eq. (10) as

σ∗ =

1

1 + (2t − 1)

σ +

(2t − 1)
1 + (2t − 1)

˜σ ,

(11)

identifying µ → 2t − 1 implies ν(σa|x) ≤ 2t − 1, and the
claim follows.
Hence, it only remains to be shown that indeed σ∗ is un-
steerable. For this, we show that the communication protocol
to simulate σ with a message of length t can be recast into a
LHS model of the form (2) for σ∗. The details are provided in
App. A, but the main idea to construct the LHS model is the
following. Suppose t is the length of the message that Alice
has to send Bob to simulate σ. Using the shared randomness
λ, they now choose one m among all the possible length t
messages. Bob then prepares the state σm,λ. Alice, in turn,
is given an input x and should provide an output a: the way
she produces this outcome is the following. If the message
m is the one she would send Bob for this x when simulat-
ing σ, she outputs a according to the simulation protocol of
the target assemblage. This happens with probability 1
2t and
produces σ. Otherwise, she outputs a according to an arbi-
trary but ﬁxed ˜p(a|x). This happens with probability 1 − 1
2t
and produces an unsteerable assemblage ˜σ. Altogether, this
reproduces σ∗, proving that it is indeed unsteerable, which
concludes the proof.

To illustrate the relevance of the method, we obtain lower
bounds on the communication cost t for a class of full-rank
(cid:80)d−1
mixed entangled states, namely two-qudit isotropic states:
(V ) = V |φ+
d (cid:105) =
i=0 |i(cid:105)|i(cid:105) and V is the visibility. To do so, we use the fact
that ν(σ) can alternatively be shown to be equal to the largest
possible normalised violation of any linear steering inequal-
ity. We then use the recent results on unbounded violations
of steering inequalities [25] to ﬁnd strong lower bounds. In
particular, in prime-power dimension, by measuring (d + 1)
mutually-unbiased bases, we ﬁnd t ≥ log2(V
d/2). Simi-
larly, by measuring log2(d) dichotomic Clifford observables,
In both cases, the
amount of communication is seen to grow with the dimension
d, even though a ﬁnite number of measurements are made,
and is robust in the presence of white noise. All details can be
found in App. B.

we ﬁnd t ≥ log2(V(cid:112)log2(d)/2/2).

√

Approximate simulation.— Finally, we consider the ques-
tion of how much communication is needed for the approxi-
mate simulation of an assemblage. More precisely, given an
approximation error  > 0, what is the minimum length t of
the message from Alice to Bob such that each element σ(sim)
of Bob’s assemblage, given by Eq. (3), is close in trace dis-
tance to the target one σa|x. That is, we demand that,

An upper bound on t can be readily obtained from so-called
epsilon nets [26], i.e. sets of pure states for which Eq. (12) is
known to hold. Here, however, we are interested in lower-
bounding t, which must necessarily take into account the gen-
eral situation where the conditional states (sim)
can be mixed.
This is the content of our next result.
Result 4. Consider the steering scenario where Alice steers
Bob by performing projective rank-1 measurements. Suppose
that they want to reproduce approximately the assemblage
that arises from all such measurements on a pure-entangled
state of two qubits |ψθ(cid:105). Then,

Clearly, tbound → ∞ for  → 0, thus recovering Result 1.

Conclusion.— We discussed the communication cost of
quantum steering, i.e. the minimal amount of classical com-
munication required to simulate a quantum steering exper-
iment without using any entanglement.
In particular, we
demonstrated that this communication cost is inﬁnite for any
pure bipartite entangled state. This further conﬁrms that steer-
ing can be considered a form of quantum nonseparability
which is intermediate between entanglement and Bell nonlo-
cality, revealing striking differences between these concepts.
Also, we showed that the communication cost of steering is
inﬁnite even for certain mixed (non full-rank) entangled states.
While this cannot be the case for all non full-rank entangled
states, as some of these admit a LHS model [28, 29], it would
be still be interesting to see if there exist full-rank entangled
states with inﬁnite communication cost.

Moreover, we showed how the communication cost of
steering can be lower bounded in general, for arbitrary mixed-
state assemblages and also in approximate simulations.
In
the future it would be interesting to ﬁnd methods for placing
upper bounds on the communication cost. In particular, one
could consider the problem of constructing explicit LHS mod-
els assisted with t bits of classical communication in order to
simulate steering for given entangled mixed states. Notably,
such a model was presented very recently for the case t = 1
and two-qubit Werner states [30].

Finally, one may study the communication cost in multi-
partite steering experiments [31, 32], where many different
communication patterns can be considered. In particular, it
would be interesting to investigate the effect of post-quantum
steering [33], which is only possible in the multipartite case.

Appendix A: Details of the proof of Result 2

In this appendix we present the details of the classical pro-
tocol without communication that Alice and Bob use in the
“Minimum communication cost for arbitrary assemblages”
section to construct the assemblage σ∗. This assemblage is a
probabilistic mixture of the “target” assemblage σ, with prob-
2t , and an unsteerable one ˜σ, with probability 1 − 1
2t ,
ability 1
where t is the length of the message that Alice should send
Bob to simulate σ.

First of all, since the target assemblage σ can be simulated
by Alice and Bob when she is allowed to send him a message
m of t bits, it holds that σ = σ(sim), with σ(sim) given in
Eq. (3). Without loss of generality we can assume that the
choice of message m is deterministic on ˆx and λ, hence:

σa|ˆx =

dλ µ(λ) p(a|ˆx, λ) m,λ .

(A1)

Now, the protocol to produce σ∗ goes as follows:

- Alice and Bob choose uniformly at random a message
˜m from a set of {0, 1}t preﬁxed messages, aided by the
shared randomness λ.

- Bob: prepares the normalised state  ˜m,λ.

- Alice: given x and λ, if ˜m = m (i.e., the message she’d
send Bob given x and λ when simulating σ) outputs a
with the probability p(a|ˆx, λ) given in Eq. (A1). Oth-
erwise, she outputs a according to an arbitrary but ﬁxed
probability ˜p(a|ˆx).

The unsteerable assemblage produced by this protocol has

the following form:

˜p(a|ˆx)  ˜m,λ .

(A2)

(cid:90)

The ﬁrst term clearly prepares σ with probability 1

prove that the second term prepares an unsteerable assemblage

Hence the LHS robustness can be obtained by maximising the
violation of a steering inequality provided that its LHS bound
satisﬁes |βLHS| ≤ 1.

The following examples rely on steering inequalities with
unbounded quantum violations. They both focus on the steer-
ing scenario where Alice steers Bob by performing m mea-
surements on the d-dimensional isotropic state

Projective measurements via MUBs.– Consider the steering
scenario where Alice steers Bob by performing m projective
d-outcome measurements Πa|x on the isotropic state of di-
mension d. Assume moreover that these measurements are
given by the m = d + 1 mutually unbiased basis in Cd.

The former is clear, since the  ˜m,λ are positive semideﬁnite
themselves. For the latter, notice that

a σa|ˆx is the reduced state on Bob’s lab. Since
the right hand size of Eq. (A5) is independent of ˆx, we prove
our ﬁrst claim. Second, we need to prove that ˜σ is well nor-
malised. We do this by noticing that the left hand size of
Eq. (A5) has trace 2t − 1.

From this, and using Eqs. (A1), (A2) and (A3), Eq. (10)

ﬁnally follows, which ﬁnishes the proof.

Appendix B: Communication cost for isotropic states

In this appendix we present the details of the lower bound
on the communication cost for the example full-rank states
given in the main text. First, we elaborate on an equivalent
deﬁnition of the LHS robustness and then compute the lower
bound on the communication cost for simulating two particu-
lar assemblages.

The LHS robustnes of steering ν deﬁned by (9) can be ex-
pressed as a semideﬁnite program (SDP) in the following way:

1 + 2 ν(σ) = min

on the
isotropic state of dimension d. Assume that these opera-
tors Ax are traceless Hermitian operators {Ai}i=1:m on the
Hilbert space Hd, with the property that A2
x = 1d and that
they anticommute. Such a set is given by Hermitian operators
among the generators of a Clifford Algebra [25].

Appendix C: Proof of Result 4

d

a|ˆx

We recall here the scenario laid out in Result 1, where
the measurement x is identiﬁed with a direction in the Bloch
sphere ˆx of the corresponding projector of Alice’s measure-
ment on the maximally entangled state. The assemblage that
has to be reproduced approximately, σa|ˆx is given by Eq. (4).
In this case, Eq. (12) takes the form

(cid:17) ≤ , ∀ a, ˆx s.t. p(a|ˆx) > 0.
(cid:16)|Φa|ˆx(cid:105)(cid:104)Φa|ˆx|, (sim)
a|ˆx in the assemblage σ(sim) =(cid:8)p(a|ˆx) (sim)

The proof strategy consists in showing that if Eq. (13) is
not fulﬁlled, the maximal number Nmax of different possible
states (sim)
which Alice and Bob try to cheat is not enough for Eq. (C1)
to hold.

(cid:17)

σ is the Pauli operator vector. Using Eq. (C1) and the fact

√
clidean norm (because it is pure), we get d
=
, where θ is the angle between the two Bloch
vectors in question. Due to Eq. (C1), (sim)
a|ˆx will yield a valid
approximate simulation of a given a|ˆx only if θ is such that

≤ .

(C2)

(cid:112)

a|ˆx

We want each (sim)

to approximately simulate as large an
area on the surface of the Bloch sphere as possible. That is,
we wish to ﬁnd the optimal length γmin of γ that maximises
θ. To this end, we minimise cos θmax over γ subject to the
constraint (C2). This gives

1 − 42,

cos θmax =

(C3)
1 − 42. The
which is attained at the optimal length γmin =
latter maximal angle corresponds to a total solid angle 2π (1−
cos θmax), centred at the direction of γ, on the surface of the
Bloch sphere.

√

Then, clearly, if

Nmax <

4π

2π (1 − cos θmax)

= 2tbound,

(C4)

the simulation will not satisfy Eq. (C1). Furthermore, even
Nmax = 2tbound is not sufﬁcient either. To see this, notice
that the latter case corresponds to the well-known geometri-
cal problem of packing equally-sized circles on the surface
of a sphere [27].
In particular, packing the surface of the
unit sphere – of total area 4π – with 2tbound circles of area
4π/2tbound cannot be done without the circles overlapping
and, therefore, necessarily leaving uncovered areas. This, in
turn, implies that there are pure target states a|ˆx from which
the closest (sim)
a|ˆx will be further away than . Hence, it must
hold that

Nmax > 2tbound.

(C5)

Now, as in the proof of Theorem 1, since λ and ˆx are in-
dependent, the only way to have a successful simulation with
is that, for at least one value λ∗,
Nmax different states (sim)
a|ˆx
there are already Nmax different states (sim)
a|ˆx,λ∗. Conditioned
on an arbitrary value λ∗, the simulated average state is given
m q(m|ˆx, λ∗) m,λ∗, but, also as
by the mixture (sim)
in the proof of Theorem 1, there are at most 2t distinct such
mixtures. Hence, it must hold that 2t ≥ Nmax, which, to-
gether with Eq. (C5), renders Eq. (13) true.
