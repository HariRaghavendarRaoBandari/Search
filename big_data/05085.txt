Abstract

The aim of this paper is to study the convergence of the solution
of the Fokker-Planck equation to the associated stationary state when
time goes to inﬁnity. The force ﬁeld which we consider here is of
a general structure, that is it may not derive from a potential. The
proof is based on an adequate splitting L = B+A of the Fokker-Planck
operator L and the use of Krein-Rutmann theory.

Keywords: Fokker-Planck equation, Semigroup, m-dissipative, linear

operators, Krein-Rutman theorem, asymptotic convergence.

Introduction and main results

In this paper we study the Fokker-Planck equation

n ∂tf = ∆f + div(Ef )

f (0, x) = f0.

(1.1)

eq:1.1

We assume that (1 + |x|2)k/p f0 ∈ Lp(Rd) for some k ≥ 0 and E : Rd 7→ Rd.
Unlike previous works, we consider a general vector ﬁeld E, which does not
derive necessarily from a potential. Under suitable assumptions on the vector
ﬁeld we establish that f (t) → M(f0)G with exponential rate as time t goes
eq:1.1
to inﬁnity. The function G stands for the positive stationary solution of (
1.1)
with total mass equal to 1, and the mass of a function is deﬁned throughout
this paper by

M(g) := ZRd

g(x)dx,

for all integrable function g

We thus generalise similar results obtained by M.P. Gualdani, S. Mischler and
GMM
[6], where the force ﬁeld E is assumed to be of the form E =
C. Mouhot in
loc(Rd, Rd) is such that, div(Ue−ϕ) = 0.
∇ϕ + U, with ϕ : Rd 7→ R, and U ∈ L1
In that case, it is noticed that µ := e−ϕ is a stationary solution, and a
Poincar´e inequality

ZRd |u − M(u)|2e−ϕdx ≤ CZRd |∇u|2e−ϕdx

holds. For instance one may choose a function ϕ of the form

ϕ(x) =

1
γ|x|γ + c0,

where γ ≥ 1 and c0 ∈ R is such that

ZRd

e−ϕ(x)dx = 1,

2

that is µ = e−ϕ is a probability mesure. Thus under some appropriate
eq:1.1
conditions on the function ϕ they prove that the solution f of (
1.1) converges
to M(f0) µ, when t goes to inﬁnity, where we denote

M(f0) := ZRd

f0(x)d(x) = ZRd

f0(x)dx.

(1.2)

1.1 Hypotheses

Throughout this paper, we assume that the following assumption (H0) holds:
(H0) The vector ﬁeld E ∈ W 1,∞
Furthermore in the statement of our results we may require some of the
following assumptions:
(H1) For some constants α, α2 > 0 ≥ 0, and β, β2 ∈ R and exponents

loc (Rd, Rd).

and for all x ∈ Rd, the following holds

1 < γ ≤ γ2 ≤ 2

α|x|γ − β ≤ x · E ≤ α2|x|γ2 + β2.
(H2) There exists β0 ∈ R such that the following holds
1 + |x|2 · E ≥ β0,

p′ = 1.

(H3) There exists ω⋆ > 0 and R > 0 large enough, such that for all k > 0,

p ∈ [2, +∞), and for all x ∈ Rd satisfying |x| > R, we have
1 + |x|2 · E ≥ ω⋆.

An example of such vector ﬁelds is given by

1.2 Main results

We shall denote by L2

k the space

L2
k := L2

k(Rd) := (cid:8)f ∈ L2(Rd) ; ZRd |f (x)|2hxikdx < ∞(cid:9)

and the linear operator (L, D(L)) by

Lu := div(∇u + Eu),

for u ∈ D(L) := (cid:8)u ∈ L2

k ; Lu ∈ L2
k(cid:9).

We shall see that the linear operator L generates a C0-semigroup on L2
k. Now
we are in a position to state our ﬁrst result regarding the stationnary solution
of (

eq:1.1
1.1).

(1.6)

eq:1.6

thm:GS Theorem 1.1. Let (L, D(L)) be deﬁned by (

eq:1.6
1.6). Assume that hypotheses
eq:1.1
(H1) and (H2) hold with p = 2 in (H2). Then the equation (
1.1) has a
stationary solution. More precisely there exists a unique function G ∈ L2
k,
strictly positive, such that

LG = 0 and

ZRd

G(x)dx = 1.

(1.7)

eq:1.8

The following is our main result regarding the evolution equation.

thm:Cv-GS Theorem 1.2. Assume that hypotheses (H1), (H2) and (H3) hold and let
eq:1.1

2 Deﬁnitions and notations

We recall in this section some deﬁnitions and notations. We denote

hxi := (1 + |x|2)1/2
We deﬁne the Lebesgue spaces Lp
follows:

k

and hxik := (cid:0)1 + |x|2(cid:1)
k(Rd) and the Sobolev spaces H 1

2 .

k (Rd) as

Lp

k(Rd) := nf ∈ Lp(Rd) ; ZRd |f (x)|phxikdx < ∞o,

4

for all p, k ∈ R such that k > 0 and p ≥ 1. We endow these spaces with their
natural norms. The scalar product of L2

k is deﬁned by

(f|g)k := ZRd

f (x)g(x)hxikdx,

for all f and g ∈ L2
H 1

k. We set

k (Rd) := nf ∈ L2

k(Rd) ; ∇f ∈ (L2

k(Rd))do.

To prove Theorems

c (Rd) is dense in Lp

It is clear that the space C ∞

k for p < ∞, as well as in H 1
k .
We recall that RL(λ) := (λ − L)−1 denotes the resolvent operator of L
for some given λ such that the operator (λ − L) has a bounded inverse and
SL(t) := exp(tL) denotes the semigroup generated by L.
thm:Cv-GS
1.2, our approach is based on the decom-
position of the operator L as follows: for an appropriately chosen bounded
operator B, we shall split L in the form L = B + A, where the operator A
is so that there is some τ0 ∈ R such that for all τ > τ0, the linear operator
JM
A − τ I is m-dissipative, (See J. Scher and S. Mischler
[8]). With the above
assumptions we shall describe the appropriate splitting for L, and thereby
for SL(t). Indeed the mild solution of

thm:GS
1.1 and

df
dt − Lf =

df
dt − Af − Bf = 0,

is given by

f (t) = SL(t)f0 and also by f (t) = SA(t)f0 +Z t

0

SA(t − τ )BSL(τ )f0dτ.

Where SA(t) = exp(tA). This means that we can write the semigroup SL(t)
split as follows:

SL(t) = SA(t) + (SA ∗ BSL)(t),

(2.1)

eq:Rel-Conv

where the convolution ∗ is deﬁned by
(SA ∗ (BSL))(t) := Z t

0

SA(t − τ )BSL(τ )f0dτ.

Analogously we may consider the equation

dv
dt − Av = 0 with initial data v(0, x) = v0(x),

5

and since we have Av := Lv − Bv, we conclude that

dv
dt − Lv = −Bv with v(0, x) = v0(x).

This implies that

SA(t)v0 = SL(t)v0 −Z t

0

SL(t − τ )BSA(τ )v0dτ.

and then one sees again that (

eq:Rel-Conv
2.1) can also be written as follows:

SL(t) = SA(t) + (SL ∗ BSA)(t).

(2.2)

eq:Rel-Conv-bis

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 3, we state
preliminary results wich are used in the sequel.
In section 4, existence of
a the stationary solution will be investigated. And in the last section 5,
eq:1.1
we explore the stability issue for the evolution equation (
1.1) and prove our
second main result, Theorem

thm:Cv-GS
1.2.

3 Preliminary results

In this section we discuss the existence of a solution for the evolution equation
eq:1.1
(
1.1) in some Banach spaces. To this end we study some properties of the
linear operator (L, D(L)).

thm:Exist-SG Proposition 3.1. Assume that (H2) holds with p = 2. Consider (L, D(L))
1.6). Then there exists λ0 := λ0(2) ∈ R such that for all λ ≥ λ0

eq:1.6

and for f ∈ L2

k we have

k is the initial data of (

k. Moreover if f0 ∈ L2

That is, the linear operator (L, D(L)) is the generator of a C0-semigroup of
eq:1.1
contraction on L2
1.1), there exists
f ∈ C ([0, T ]; L2
Proof. We aim to show that there exists λ0 ∈ R such that for any λ ≥ λ0,
the operator L − λI is m-dissipative, more precisely
((λ − L)f|f )k ≥ (λ − λ0)kfkL2

We begin by showing that for an appropriate choice of λ, the operator −L+λI
is coercive. Indeed for, ϕ ∈ C ∞
(−Lϕ|ϕ)k = −ZRd

div(∇ϕ(x) + E(x)ϕ(x))ϕ(x) hxikdx.

− Lf + λf = f0.

c , we have

Thus integrating by parts we botain

(−Lϕ|ϕ)k = ZRd

(∇ϕ(x) + E(x)ϕ(x)) · ∇(ϕ(x) hxik)dx.

Now computing ∇(ϕ(x) hxik) = ∇ϕ(x) hxik + ϕ(x) ∇hxik, and using this
expression in the identity above, we get

(−Lϕ|ϕ)k = I1 + I2 + I3 + I4,

where for convenience we denote

I1 := ZRd |∇ϕ(x)|2hxikdx,

I2 := ZRd

I3 := ZRd

ϕ(x)∇ϕ(x) · ∇hxikdx,

and

ϕ(x)∇ϕ(x) · E(x) hxikdx,
I4 := ZRd

ϕ(x)2E(x) · ∇hxikdx.

We rewrite I2 as

I2 =

1

2 ZRd ∇(ϕ2) · Ehxikdx,

and then we integrate by parts to obtain

I2 = −

1

2 ZRd

ϕ2div(Ehxik)dx.

Since div(Ehxik) = div(E)hxik + E · ∇hxik, then I2 becomes:
ϕ2E · ∇hxikdx.

ϕ2div(E)hxik −

I2 = −

Summing I2 and I4 we obtain

I3 =

which, integrated by parts, yields

I3 = −

Summing together I1, I2, I3 and I4 we obtain

Ψk(x) := −∆hxik − div(E) + E · ∇hxik.

Using the expressions

∇hxik := k

we obtain

∆hxik := (kd + k(k + d − 2)|x|2)

hxik = −

kd + k(k + d − 2)|x|2

1 + |x|2 · E.

Thus using hypothesis (H2) with p = 2 we ﬁnd

Ψk(x)

hxik ≥ β0 −

kd + k(k + d − 2)|x|2

(1 + |x|2)2

.

now setting

λ0 := max
[
x∈Rd

One obtains the following inequality

kd

1 + |x|2 +

k(k − 2)|x|2
(1 + |x|2)2 − β0].

eq:2.4

(−Lϕ|ϕ)k ≥ ZRd |∇ϕ|2hxikdx − λ0ZRd

ϕ2hxikdx ≥ 0.

(3.7)

eq:2.5

This inequality, together with a density argument, implies that λ − L is
coercive for all λ > λ0. This means that for all λ > λ0 we have

((λ − L)ϕ|ϕ) ≥ ZRd |∇ϕ|2hxikdx + (λ − λ0)ZRd

ϕ2hxikdx.

Then an elementary application of Lax-Milgram lemma in the space H 1
implies that for any λ > λ0 and any f0 ∈ L2
solution f ∈ H 1

Now, for µ > 0 given and f0 ∈ L2
k the equation

k, equation (

[I + µ(λ0 − L)]f = f0

and as we have λ := λ0 + 1

µ > λ0. Multiplying (

eq:2.6
3.8) by f yields

L2

k ≤ (f0|f )k,

from wich we deduce that the unique solution of (

eq:2.6

that is the operator (L− λ0I) is m-dissipative. This means that the operator
(L − λI) generates a C0-semigroup of contraction on L2
k:

k ≤ kf0kL2

.

From this it is classical to deduce that the solution of (

Proof. Indeed, to see this, we note that for f ∈ D(L) we clearly have f − ∈ H 1
and thus

k

(Lf|f −)k = −ZRd ∇f (x) · ∇f −(x) hxik dx −ZRd

f (x)E(x) · ∇(f −(x) hxik) dx.

Now, since we have

f = f + − f −,

∇f = ∇f + − ∇f −

and

f +∇f − = 0,

in a ﬁrst step this allows us to see that

(Lf|f −)k = ZRd |∇f −|2hxikdx +ZRd

f −(x)∇f −(x) · ∇hxikdx

+ZRd

f −(x) E · ∇f −(x) hxikdx +ZRd |f −(x)|2 E · ∇hxikdx.

Now integrating by parts in the second and the third terms of the identity

Using the expressions of ∇hxik and that of ∆hxik on the one hand, and the
fact that ω⋆ satisﬁes (

eq:1.5

(Lf|f −) ≥ ZRd |∇f −(x)|2 hxik dx +

ω⋆

2 ZRd |f −(x)|2 hxik dx,

which is precisely (

eq:Coercive-1

(−Lf|f ) ≥ ZRd |∇f (x)|2 hxik dx +

which, since λ + (ω⋆/2) > 0 implies f − ≡ 0, that is f ≥ 0.

Our next useful result is the fact that the semigroup SL(t) is positivity

In order to make the proof more clear, we are going to treat the second and

give the following proof.

Proof. Let f ∈ D(L), by deﬁnition of D(L) we have f ∈ L2
This implies in particular that f ∈ H 1

k and we have also

jε(s) := (ε2 + s2)1/2 − ε

for s ∈ R. A simple calculation gives

j′
ε(s) =

s

√ε2 + s2

and

j′′
ε (s) =

ε2

(ε2 + s2)3/2 .

Note that j′′

ε (s) ≥ 0. For f ∈ D(L) we compute ∇jε(f ) and ∆jε(f ) that is
(4.3)

∇jε(f ) = j′

ε(f )∇f

and

Then for all ϕ ∈ C ∞

c

ε (f )|∇f|2 + j′

∆jε(f ) = j′′
such that ϕ ≥ 0, since j′′(f ) ≥ 0 we have

ε(f )∆f.

Since jε(f ) → |f| in L2

ε(f )∆f, ϕi.

h∆jε(f ), ϕi ≥ hj′
k and ∆ϕ ∈ L∞ ∩ L1, we have in particular
∆jε(f ) → ∆|f|

in D ′(Rd).

(4.4)

(4.5)

Therefore

On the other hand using the deﬁnition of L we obtain the following inequality

h∆jε(f ), ϕi → h∆|f|, ϕi.

hLjε(f ), ϕi ≥ hj′

ε(f )∆f + div(jε(f )E), ϕi.

19

The right hand side term of the above inequality can be rewritten as follows:
hj′
ε(f )∆f + div(jε(f E)), ϕi = hj′
Due to the fact that j′

ε(f )∇f · E + jε(f )div(E), ϕi.

ε(f ) → sgn(f ) a.e. on Rd, one sees that

ε(f )∆f + j′

ε(f )∆f, ϕi = ZRd

ε(f )∆f ϕdx → ZRd

On the other hand, since E and div(E) belong to L∞

So ﬁnally we infer that

ε(f )∆f + j′
hj′

ε(f )∇f · E, ϕi → hsgn(f )∆f + sgn(f )∇f · E, ϕi,

when ε goes to 0. Analogously we have

hjε(f )div(E), ϕi = ZRd

jε(f )div(E)ϕdx → ZRd |f|div(E)ϕdx,

when ε goes to 0, since |jε(f )| ≤ |f| ∈ L2
sgn(s) · s. Therefore we have

loc. Now we remind that |s| =

h|f|div(E), ϕi = hsgn(f ) f div(E), ϕi,

and thus we obtain

hL|f|, ϕi = lim

ε→0hLjε(f ), ϕi ≥ hsgn(f )∆f + ∇|f| · E + |f|div(E), ϕi.

However one may check that

∇|f| · E + |f|div(E) = sgn(f )∇f · E + sgn(f )f div(E)

= sgn(f )(cid:2)∇f · E + f div(E)(cid:3),

from which we conclude that

sgn(f )∆f + ∇|f| · E + |f|div(E) = sgn(f )Lf,
and ﬁnally that for all ϕ ∈ D(Rd) such that ϕ ≥ 0 we have

hL|f|, ϕi ≥ hsgn(f )Lf, ϕi,

eq:Kato
4.2).

which is precisely the Kato’s inequality (

20

The Kato’s inequality will stay true if we replace |f| by the positive part

of f , that is f + := (|f| + f )/2. In this case we have

Lf + ≥

(1 + sgn(f ))

Lf = 1{f >0} · Lf.

Remark 4.2. It is well known that if L satisﬁes Kato’s inequality then this
is equivalent to say that the semigroup which is generated by L is a positivity
preserving semigroup, in the sense that if f0 ≥ 0 then SL(t)f0 ≥ 0. See for

or W. Arendt (

BS
[13], R. Nagel and H. Uhlig

WA
[1][ theorem 1.6 page 159]).

Remark 4.3. The Kato’s inequality implies also the weak maximum princi-
ple: in other words, if f ∈ D(L) and Lf ≤ 0, then f ≥ 0.

thm:Str-MP Lemma 4.4 (Strong maximum principle). Let f ∈ D(L) ∩ W 2,∞(Rd), then

the linear operator L satisﬁes a strong maximum priciple. i.e

(cid:0)f ≥ 0,

⇒

f > 0.

(4.6)

f 6≡ 0

and Lf ≤ 0(cid:1)

Proof. Let f ∈ D(L) be such that f 6≡ 0 and Lf ≤ 0 on Rd. By the weak
thm:Kat
maximum principle, which is a consequence of Kato’s inequality Lemma
4.1,
we know that f ≥ 0, and actually for any R > 0 we have

M(R) := inf
|x|≤R

f (x) ≥ 0.

If there exists R0 > 0 and x0 ∈ B(0, R0) such that f (x0) = 0, then M(R0) =
0, and consequently for any R > R0 we have also M(R) = 0. Therefore,
according to Hopf maximum principle (see for instance Theorem 5, chapter
Protter-Weinberger
2, section 3 of the classical book of M.H. Protter & H.F. Weinberger
[12]) we
have f ≡ 0 in B(0, R), for all R, and this contradicts the fact that f 6≡ 0 on
Rd.

s(L) := sup(cid:8)Re(z), z ∈ Σ(L)(cid:9)

is m-dissipative(cid:9),

and Σ(L) is the spectrum of L.

Now we will recall a result of S. Mischler and J. Scher

JM
[8, Theorem 4.3,

page 39] which reads :

thm:SM-JC Theorem 4.7. We consider an operator L, wich is a generator of a semi-

group SL(t) on a Banach lattice of functions X and we assume that:

(1) we have L = A + B, where B is a bounded linear operator and A is such
that there exists τ ∈ R, such that A − τ I is m-dissipative.

22

(2) There exist b ∈ R and ψ ∈ D(L∗) ∩ X+\{0}, such that we have

L∗ψ ≥ bψ.

(3) SL is a positivity preserving semigroup.

(4) L satisﬁes the strong maximum principle.

Then we have s(L) = ω(L), and denoting this common value by λ, there

exists G ∈ D(L) such that

G > 0,

LG = λG

with λ := s(L).

The originality of this theorem is the fact that, it establishes a spectral
theory result like Krein-Rutmann’s in a non compact framework. It allows
us to circumvent the lack of compactness of the linear operator. It keeps the
philosophy of Krein-Rutman theorem while weakening itsassumptions.

Proof. (of Theorem
thm:Exist-SG
Let (L, D(L)) be deﬁned by (
3.1 applied to the operator
L we have the existence of a real number λ, such that L−λI be m-dissipative,
and generates a semigroup on the space X := L2
k. We are going to verify that
the conditions of Theorem

eq:1.6
1.6). From Theorem

thm:GS
1.1)

thm:SM-JC
4.7 are satisﬁed.

(1) We know that the operator L can be split in the following way: for all
f ∈ D(L),

Lf := Bf + Af,

where B is a bounded operator, and deﬁned as follows there exists M > 0
and n ≥ 1, such that for ζn gigen by (

eq:Def-zeta-n
3.14)

Bf := Mζnf

and f ∈ D(L).

And the linear operator A is such that there exists a real number τ , such
that A − τ is m-dissipative and

Af := Lf − Bf,

for all

f ∈ D(L).

The Proposition

thm:adj
4.6 applied to L leads to the following:

23

(2) There exists b0 ∈ R, such that for some b > b0, we have a function ψ > 0,
ψ ∈ D(L∗), such that

L∗ψ ≥ bψ.

An application of Lemma

thm:Kat
4.1 to the operator L allows us to deduce that

L satisﬁes Kato’s inequality. This means that:
(3) For all f ∈ D(L) we have L|f| ≥ sgn(f )Lf. Therefore the semigroup
generated by (L, D(L)) is positivity preserving semigroup.

Using Lemma

thm:Str-MP
4.4 one can assert that the linear operator L satisﬁes the

strong maximum principle. i.e
(4) If (f 6≡ 0, f ≥ 0 and Lf ≤ 0), then f > 0 in Rd.

Then applying Theorem

thm:SM-JC
4.7 we conclude that , there exists G > 0, such

that

deﬁnition of the linear operator A. Then there exists f ∈ C 1([0, T ]; L2

Since SL(t) is a C0-semi group, there exists ω1 ∈ R and C0 ≥ 1, such that
kSL(t)k ≤ C1eω1t. Now we choose a1 a real number, such that a1 > ω1.
Thus using the inverse Laplace transform formula we obtain the following
representation:

(SL ∗ BSA ∗ BSA)(t) :=

1

2iπ Z a1+i∞

a1−i∞

eztRL(z)(BRA(z))2dz.

Since 0 is a simple eigenvalue of L one can deﬁne the projection operator Π
on the space generated by G, wich is the eigenfunction associated to 0. The
projection operator Π is deﬁned as follows: for all f ∈ D(L)

Πf = M(f )G, where M(f ) := ZRd

f (x)dx.

Using Proposition

thm:Contract
5.1 we can easily establish that
k(SA ∗ BSA)(t)k ≤ C 2kBk t e−ω⋆t.

It has been shown in
[8, Theorem 2.1] that if there exist two linear operators
A and B such that L = A + B, where A and B are given as in Proposition

(5.5)

thm:Contract
5.1 and such that (
a⋆ > 0 such that the spectrum

eq:sdp1
5.5) holds, then a spectral gap exists, that is we can ﬁnd

Σ(L) ⊂ (cid:8)z ∈ C | Re(z) < −a⋆ (cid:9) ∪(cid:8)0(cid:9).

Now we choose a such that 0 < a < a⋆ and we deﬁne

Ja(t) :=

Using (

sdp
5.4) we have

1

2iπ Z −a+i∞

−a−i∞

eztRL(z)(BRA(z))2dz.

SL(t)(I − Π) = SA(t)(I − Π) + (SA ∗ BSA)(t)(I − Π)

2iπ Z −a+i∞

−a−i∞

eztRL(z)(BRA(z))2(I − Π)dz,

Choose ω2 ∈ (a, a⋆), and consider z = −a + is, for s ∈ R. Since

(zI − A)RA(z) = I,

then

RA =

1
z

(I − ARA(z)) =

Thus we have

−a + is

(I − ARA(−a + is)).

(a2 + s2)kRL(−a + is)kkB(I − ARA(−a + is))k2ds.

We know that since the operator B(I − ARA(−a + is)) is bounded uniformly
in s, then there exists a constant C > 0 such that

∀s ∈ R,

kB(I − ARA(−a + is))k ≤ C.

Since L generates a C0-semigoup. One has
kRL(−a + is)k ≤

C0

Consequently we obtain

kJa(t)k ≤ Ce−a t C0

as t → +∞, therefore we have

kJa(t)k ≤

Using the identity (

5.4) we have

C0

e−at.

SL(t)(I − Π)f0 = SA(t)(I − Π)f0 + (SA ∗ BSA)(t)(I − Π)f0

+ (SL ∗ BSA ∗ BSA)(t)(I − Π)f0.

Thus we have

(5.6)

eq:ja

kSL(t)(I − Π)f0kL2

k ≤ kSA(t)(I − Π)f0kL2
+ k(SL ∗ BSA ∗ BSA)(t)(I − Π)f0kL2

k

+ k(SA ∗ BSA)(t)(I − Π)f0kL2

k

.

Since we know that

k(SL ∗ BSA ∗ BSA)(t)(I − Π)f0kL2

k ≤ kJa(t)k · k(I − Π)f0kL2

k

and that thanks to (

eq:ja
5.6) we have

k(SL ∗ BSA ∗ BSA)(t)(I − Π)f0kL2
On the other hand we have prove that

k ≤

C0
ω2 − a

e−at · k(I − Π)f0kL2

k

.

k(SA ∗ BSA)(t)(I − Π)f0kL2

k ≤ CkBk t e−ω⋆tk(I − Π)f0kL2

k

.

We may use Proposition

thm:Contract
5.1 to obtain that

kSA(t)(I − Π)f0kL2

k ≤ Ce−ω⋆tk(I − Π)f0kL2

k

.

Now we choose 0 < ω < min(w⋆, a) and then we have

kSL(t)(I − Π)f0kL2

k ≤ C(ω, t)e−ω tk(I − Π)f0kL2

k

.

This completes the proof of Theorem

thm:Cv-GS
1.2.
