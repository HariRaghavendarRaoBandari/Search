ABSTRACT

In this paper, we report on the available X-ray data collected by INTEGRAL, Swift, and XMM-Newton during the ﬁrst outburst of the
INTEGRAL transient IGR J17451–3022, discovered in 2014 August. The monitoring observations provided by the JEM-X instruments
on-board INTEGRAL and the Swift /XRT showed that the event lasted for about 9 months and that the emission of the source remained
soft for the entire period. The source emission is dominated by a thermal component (kT ∼ 1.2 keV), most likely produced by an
accretion disk. The XMM-Newton observation carried out during the outburst revealed the presence of multiple absorption features in
the soft X-ray emission that could be associated to the presence of an ionized absorber lying above the accretion disk, as observed in
many high-inclination low mass X-ray binaries. The XMM-Newton data also revealed the presence of partial and rectangular X-ray
eclipses (lasting about 820 s), together with dips. The latter can be associated with increases in the overall absorption column density
in the direction of the source. The detection of two consecutive X-ray eclipses in the XMM-Newton data allowed us to estimate the
source orbital period at Porb=22620.5+2.0
−1.8 s (1σ c.l.).

1. Introduction

IGR J17451–3022 is
an X-ray transient discovered by
INTEGRAL on 2014 August 22, during the observations per-
formed in the direction of the Galactic center (Chenevez et al.
2014). The source underwent a 9 months-long outburst and
began its return to quiescence in the second half of May
2015 (Bahramian et al. 2015a). At discovery, the source dis-
played a relatively soft emission, signiﬁcantly detected by the
JEM-X instrument on-board INTEGRAL only below 10 keV
(Chenevez et al. 2014). The estimated 3–10 keV ﬂux was
∼7 mCrab, corresponding to roughly 10−10 erg cm−2 s−1. The
outburst of
IGR J17451–3022 was followed-up with Swift
(Altamirano et al. 2014; Heinke et al. 2014; Bahramian et al.
2015b, 2014a,a), S uzaku, (Jaisawal et al. 2015), and Chandra
(Chakrabarty et al. 2014). The best determined source posi-
tion was obtained from the Chandra data at RA(J2000) =
17h45m06.s72, Dec(J2000) = −30◦22′43.′′3, with an associated
uncertainty of 0.′′6 (90 % c.l.). The spectral energy distribution
of the source, together with the discovery of X-ray eclipses
spaced by ∼6.3 h, led to the classiﬁcation of this source as
a low mass X-ray binary (LMXB; Bahramian et al. 2014b;
Jaisawal et al. 2015).

In this paper we report on the analysis of all available Swift
and INTEGRAL data collected during the outburst of the source,
together with a XMM-Newton Target of Opportunity observation
(ToO) that was performed on 2014 March 6 for 40 ks.

2. INTEGRALdata

During its outburst, IGR J17451–3022 was visible within the
ﬁeld of view of the two JEM-X units on-board INTEGRAL from
satellite revolution 1448 (starting on 2014 August 18) to 1470
(hereafter ﬁrst part of the outburst) and from 1508 to 1533 (end-
ing on 2015 April 25; hereafter second part of the outburst). We
analyzed all the publicly available INTEGRAL data and those
for which our group got access rights in the INTEGRAL AO11
by using version 10.1 of the Oﬀ-line Scientiﬁc Analysis soft-
ware (OSA) distributed by the ISDC (Courvoisier et al. 2003).
INTEGRAL observations are divided into “science windows”
(SCWs), i.e. pointings with typical durations of ∼2-3 ks. Only
SCWs in which the source was located to within an oﬀ-axis
angle of 4.5 deg from the center of the JEM-X ﬁeld of view
(Lund et al. 2003) were included in the JEM-X analysis, while
for IBIS/ISGRI we retained all SCWs where the source was
within an oﬀ-axis angle of 12 deg from the center of the instru-
ment ﬁeld of view. We extracted the IBIS/ISGRI (Ubertini et al.
2003; Lebrun et al. 2003) mosaics in the 20-40 keV and 40-
80 keV energy bands, while the JEM-X mosaics were extracted
in the 3-10 keV and 10-20 keV energy bands (we used be-
low JEM-X1 as a reference to provide all quantitative results
but checked that compatible values, to within the uncertainties,
would be obtained with JEM-X2).

By checking the IBIS/ISGRI mosaics of each revolution, we
noticed that the source was never signiﬁcantly detected except
for revolution 1458 which covers the period 2014 September
21 at 19:02 UTC to September 24 at 03:24 UTC (total expo-
sure time 158 ks). In this revolution, we estimated from the
IBIS/ISGRI mosaics a source detection signiﬁcance of 8.4σ in
the 20-40 keV energy band and 7.8σ in the 40-80 keV energy
band. The corresponding source count-rate in the two energy
bands was 0.80±0.10 cts s−1 and 0.54±0.07 cts s−1, which trans-
late into ﬂuxes of 5.7±0.7 mCrab (∼4.4×10−11 erg cm−2 s−1)
and 7.2±0.9 mCrab (∼5.0×10−11 erg cm−2 s−1), respectively1.
In the IBIS/ISGRI mosaic obtained during the ﬁrst part of the
outburst (revolutions 1448-1470), excluding revolution 1458, the
source was only marginally detected at ∼5.6σ in the 20-40 keV
energy range and ∼7.0σ in the 40-80 keV energy range. The
count-rate of the source was roughly 0.2 cts s−1 in both energy
bands, corresponding to a ﬂux of ∼1.5 mCrab in the 20-40 keV
energy band and ∼2.5 mCrab in the 40-80 keV energy band
(i.e. ∼1.2×10−11 erg cm−2 s−1 and ∼1.7×10−11 erg cm−2 s−1, re-
spectively). Given the relatively long cumulated exposure time
of the mosaic (1.4 Ms), several structures were detected at sig-
niﬁcances close or higher than that of IGR J17451–3022. For
this reason, we cannot discriminate if the ﬂuxes measured from
the position of the source are genuine or simply due to back-
ground ﬂuctuations arising in the crowded and complex region
of the Galactic Center. We can certainly conclude that the over-
all ﬂux of the source during the ﬁrst part of the outburst in the
IBIS/ISGRI energy band was signiﬁcantly lower than that mea-
sured during the revolution 1458 alone. A similar conclusion
applies to the IBIS/ISGRI mosaic extracted during the second
part of the outburst, i.e. including data from revolution 1508 to
1533 (total exposure time 1.3 Ms). In this case the detection

1 The conversion from count-rate to mCrab was carried out by us-
ing the most recent observations of the Crab (at the time of writing) in
spacecraft revolution 1597. From these data we measured for the Crab
a count-rate of 139.4 cts s−1 and 75.2 cts s−1 from the IBIS/ISGRI mo-
saics in the 20-40 keV and 40-80 keV. The estimated count-rates in the
JEM-X mosaics were of 111.6 cts s−1 and 29.6 cts s−1 in the energy
band 3-10 keV and 10-20 keV, respectively.

signiﬁcance of the source was of only 5.0σ in the 20-40 keV
energy band and 3.6σ in the 40-80 keV energy range. These
low signiﬁcance detections are likely due to background ﬂuc-
tuations. We estimated in this case a 3σ upper limit on the
source ﬂux of about 2 mCrab in both the 20-40 keV and 40-
80 keV energy bands (corresponding to ∼1.5×10−11 erg cm−2 s−1
and ∼1.4×10−11 erg cm−2 s−1, respectively). By combining the
ISGRI data from all revolution 1448-1533, excluding revolution
1458, we did not notice an increase in the source detection sig-
niﬁcance. In this deeper mosaic (total exposure time 2.7 Ms), the
source detection was at 6σ in the 20-40 keV energy band and
7.6σ in the 40-80 keV energy band. This ﬁnding supports the
idea that the mentioned low level detections in all revolutions
but 1458 are likely to result from background ﬂuctuations.

In revolution 1458, the source was detected at 5.8σ in
the 3-10 keV JEM-X energy band with a count-rate of
0.80±0.14 cts s−1 (total exposure time 37 ks). The estimated ﬂux
was 7.2±1.2 mCrab (∼1.0×10−10 erg cm−2 s−1). The source was
only marginally detected (∼3σ) in the 10-20 keV energy band
with a count-rate of 0.17±0.06 cts s−1 and a ﬂux of 5±2 mCrab
(corresponding to ∼4.6×10−11 erg cm−2 s−1).

We did not detect signiﬁcant variability of the 3-10 keV
source ﬂux in the JEM-X data collected in all other revolutions,
but the corresponding ﬂux in the 10-20 keV energy band seemed
to decrease by a factor of at least &3. In the JEM-X mosaic
built by using data from revolution 1448 to 1470 (excluding
revolution 1458), the source was detected with a count-rate of
0.67±0.04 cts s−1 (detection signiﬁcance 16σ) in the 3-10 keV
energy band and we estimated a 3σ upper limit of 2 mCrab
for the ﬂux in the 10-20 keV energy band (total exposure time
367 ks). In revolutions 1508 to 1533, the source was detected
with a count-rate of 0.70±0.04 cts s−1 (detection signiﬁcance
18σ) in the 3-10 keV energy band and we estimated a 3σ up-
per limit of 2 mCrab for the ﬂux in the 10-20 keV energy band
(total exposure time 372 ks). When data from all revolutions but
1458 are merged (see Fig. 1), the estimated source count-rate in
the 3-10 keV energy range is 0.68±0.03 cts s−1 (detection signiﬁ-
cance 23.7σ) and the 3σ upper limit for the ﬂux in the 10-20 keV
energy band is 1 mCrab (total exposure time 738 ks).

Given the above results, we focused on the JEM-X and
ISGRI spectra extracted from the data collected during satel-
lite revolution 1458. As the source was relatively faint and
the surrounding region crowded, the JEM-X spectra were ex-
tracted with the mosaic spec tool from a mosaic with 8 en-
ergy bins (spanning the range 3-25 keV) in order to avoid
contamination from nearby sources. ISGRI spectra were ex-
tracted by using a 6 energy bins response matrix in the range
20-100 keV. We ignored during the ﬁt to these spectra the
energy range 20-25 keV in JEM-X due to the lack of sig-
nal from the source and the ﬁrst bin in ISGRI to avoid cali-
bration uncertainties. The combined JEM-X+ISGRI spectrum
could be well ﬁt (χ2
red/d.o.f.=0.4/7) by using a simple absorp-
tion power-law model (the absorption column density was ﬁxed
to the best value determined from the XMM-Newton data, i.e.
NH=5.6×1022 cm−2; see Sect. 4). The best ﬁt power-law pho-
ton index was Γ=2.0±0.4 and the measured absorbed ﬂux
in the 3-20 keV (20-100 keV) was 1.0×10−10 erg cm−2 s−1
(8.8×10−11 erg cm−2 s−1). A ﬁt with a single thermal component,
as bbodyrad or diskbb in Xspec, could not provide an acceptable
ﬁt to the broad-band data (χ2
red/d.o.f.&7). The combined JEM-
X+ISGRI spectrum of IGR J17451–3022 is shown in Fig. 2.

Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, no meaningful ISGRI
spectrum could be extracted for the source when all data but
those in revolution 1458 were stacked together. The correspond-

ing JEM-X spectrum resulted in only 3 energy bins with a sig-
niﬁcant ﬂux measurement and thus discriminating between dif-
ferent spectral models (i.e. a power-law rather than a thermal
component) was not possible. The spectrum would be compati-
ble with both a power-law of photon index ∼3 or a diskbb with
a temperature of ∼1 keV. The 3-10 keV ﬂux estimated from the
spectral ﬁt was ∼1.0×10−10 erg cm−2 s−1 (not corrected for ab-
sorption).

Considering all the results of the INTEGRAL analysis to-
gether, we thus conclude that the spectral energy distribution
measured during the ﬁrst detectable outburst of IGR J17451–
3022 remained generally soft and hardly detected above
∼10 keV. There are, however, indications that the source might
have undergone a spectral state transition during the INTEGRAL
revolution 1458, where a signiﬁcant detection above 20 keV was
recorded.

Finally, we also extracted the JEM-X1 and JEM-X2
lightcurves with a time resolution of 2 s to search for type-I X-
ray bursts. However, we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant detection.

3. Swiftdata

Swift /XRT (Burrows et al. 2005) periodically observed the
source starting close to its initial detection, until it faded into
quiescience 9 months later (i.e. from 2014 August 5 to 2015
June 6). Observations in the period 2014 November to 2015
early February were not available due to the satellite Sun con-
straints. A log of all available XRT observations is reported in
Table 1.

XRT data were collected in both windowed-timing (WT)
and photon-counting (PC) mode and analyzed by using stan-
dard procedures and the FTOOLS software (v6.16). The XRT
data were processed with the xrtpipeline (v.0.13.1) and the lat-
est calibration ﬁles available (20140730). The WT data were
never aﬀected by pile-up, therefore WT source events were ex-
tracted from circular regions of 20 pixels (1 pixel ∼ 2.36′′).
On the contrary, when required, the PC data were corrected for
pile-up by adopting standard procedures (Vaughan et al. 2006;
Romano et al. 2006). In particular, we determined the size of the
aﬀected core of the point spread function (PSF) by comparing
the observed and nominal PSF, and excluded from the analysis

all the events that fell within that region. The PC source events
were thus extracted either from an annuli with an outer radius
of 20 pixels and an inner radius determined from the severity of
the pile-up, or within circular regions with a radius of 20 pix-
els when pile-up was not present. Background events were ex-
tracted from nearby source-free regions. From each XRT obser-
vation we extracted an averaged spectrum and the corresponding
barycentered lightcurve. The time resolution of the lightcurves
was 1 s for data in WT mode and 2.5 s for data in PC mode. The
barycentric correction was applied by using the barycorr tool.
For the observations 025–028, a single spectrum was extracted
due to the low statistics of these data. All spectra were binned
to ensure at least 20 counts per energy bin and were ﬁt in the
0.5–10 keV energy range.

All XRT spectra could be well ﬁt by using a simple absorbed
disk blackbody model (tbabs*diskbb in Xspec; see also Sect. 4).
Fits with a power-law model provided in most cases signiﬁ-
cantly worst results. We report the best ﬁt obtained in all cases
in Table 1. The XRT monitoring showed that the spectral energy
distribution of the X-ray emission from IGR J17451–3022 was
roughly stable along the entire outburst. The absorption column
density and the temperature of the thermal component measured
by XRT remained always compatible (to within the uncertain-
ties) with the values obtained from the ﬁt to the XMM-Newton
data (see 4). We veriﬁed that ﬁxing the XRT absorption column
density to the XMM-Newton value would result in acceptable
ﬁts to all observations and negligible changes in the tempera-
ture of the thermal component. We note that no XRT observa-
tions were performed during (or suﬃciently close in time to)
the INTEGRAL revolution 1458, where a possible spectral state
transition of the source was observed (see Sect. 2).

Given the relatively low statistics of each XRT observa-
tion, we did not perform a detailed timing analysis of the data.
However, we show in Fig. 3 the total outburst lightcurve of the
source as observed by XRT from the onset of the event down
to the return in quiescence. We marked on this ﬁgure the time
intervals corresponding to the coverage provided by INTEGRAL
and the time of the ToO observation carried out by XMM-Newton
(see Sect. 4).

4. XMM-Newtondata

The XMM-Newton (Jansen et al. 2001) ToO observation of
IGR J17451–3022 was performed on 2015 March 06 for a to-
tal exposure time of 40 ks. The EPIC-pn was operated in timing
mode, the MOS2 in full frame, and the MOS1 in small window.
We reduced these data by using the SAS version 14.0 and the
latest XMM-Newton calibrations ﬁles available2 (XMM-CCF-
REL-329; see also Pintore et al. 2014). The observation was
slightly aﬀected by intervals of high ﬂaring background and thus
we ﬁltered out these intervals following the SAS online thread3.
The ﬁnal eﬀective exposure time for the three EPIC cameras was
29 ks.

We ﬁrst extracted the EPIC-pn lightcurve of the source in
the energy range 0.5-12 keV from CCD columns 28-46. The
corresponding background lightcurve was extracted by using
columns 3-10. The background-subtracted EPIC-pn lightcurve
of IGR J17451–3022 with a time bin of 50 s is shown in Fig. 4
(we also used the epiclccorr tool to correct the lightcurves for
any relevant instrumental eﬀect). The source displayed an aver-
age count-rate of 16 cts s−1, two X-ray eclipses and the presence

of dips at the beginning of the observation and between the two
eclipses. Given the source count-rate, both MOS1 and MOS2
data suﬀered from signiﬁcant pile-up. This was corrected by fol-
lowing the SAS online threads. The RGS spectra were character-
ized by a low statistics, due to the signiﬁcant extinction recorded
in the direction of the source (see later in this section). We thus
used the RGS and the MOS data only to check consistency with
the results obtained from the analysis of the EPIC-pn data, but do
not discuss them in details. A ﬁt of all data together revealed the
presence of instrumental residuals in the EPIC-pn below 1.7 keV
(see Fig. 5). This issue has been reported in several papers using
the EPIC-pn in timing mode and thus we restricted our spectral
analysis to the 1.7-12 keV energy range (see, e.g., Piraino et al.
2012; Pintore et al. 2015; D’A`ı et al. 2015; Boirin et al. 2005,
for a similar issue with EPIC-pn residuals below 1.7 keV). We
barycentered the EPIC-pn data before carrying out any timing
analysis.

4.1. TheX-rayeclipses

We used the detection of two consecutive eclipses in the
0.5-12 keV EPIC-pn lightcurve of the source to determine
the system orbital period (we used a time bin of 20 s and

Fig. 5. EPIC-pn (green), EPIC-MOS1 (black), EPIC-MOS2
(red), RGS1 (blue), and RGS2 (cyan) average spectra extracted
from the XMM-Newton observation of IGR J17451–3022. The
model used to preliminary ﬁt the data here is an absorbed disk
blackbody model (tbabs*diskbb in Xspec). The residuals from
the ﬁt in the bottom panel show the instrumental excess in the
EPIC-pn data below 1.7 keV (beside the many absorption fea-
tures, see also Fig. 7). For this reason, we only used EPIC-pn
data in the energy range 1.7-12 keV for further analysis.

(all uncertainties here are given at 1σ c.l.). This is a slightly
improved measurement compared to the value 22623±5 s
reported previously by Jaisawal et al. (2015).

4.2. Thespectralanalysis

We ﬁrst extracted the source spectrum during the steady part of
the XMM-Newton observation, i.e ﬁltering out the time intervals
corresponding to the dips and the eclipses (the resulting total ex-
posure time is 16.8 ks). This spectrum showed a curved shape
that could be described by using a thermal component typical
of an accretion disk (diskbb in Xspec). We accounted for the ab-
sorption column density in the direction of the source by using
a tbabs component with Solar abundances. Although this model
could describe the continuum reasonably well, the ﬁt was far
from being acceptable (χ2
red/d.o.f.=15.94/138) due to the pres-
ence of several absorption features. For completeness, we men-
tion that a ﬁt with an absorbed power-law (tbabs*pow in Xspec)
would give a signiﬁcantly worse ﬁt (χ2
red/d.o.f.=69.75/138). We
show in Fig. 7 the ratio between the data and the model when
the ﬁt is carried out by using the tbabs*diskbb model.

In order to improve the ﬁt, we ﬁrst included a number of
absorption Gaussian lines (gaussian in Xspec) to account for all
visible features in the residuals, and then included a broad ab-
sorption feature (gabs in Xspec) to take into account the deepest
structure around ∼9 keV (see Fig. 7). We ﬁxed to zero the widths
of the lines that could not be constrained after a preliminary ﬁt
and left this parameter free to vary in all other cases. This phe-
nomenological ﬁt was used to identify the lines that correspond
to known atomic transitions and guide further analysis. We show
all the results in Table 2, together with the identiﬁcation of the
lines. We marked with ”?” the identiﬁcations of the two lines at
5.7 and 6.1 keV for which we did not ﬁnd any other mention in
the literature of LMXBs and that we thus consider as tentative
associations.

Fig. 4. Upper ﬁgure: EPIC-pn lightcurve of IGR J17451–3022
(0.5-12 keV). The start time of the lightcurve (t=0) is 2015
March 6 at 6:26 (UTC). The bin time is 50 s for display pur-
poses. Time intervals with no data are due to the ﬁltering of
the high ﬂaring background. Bottom ﬁgure: a zoom of the ﬁrst
eclipse (time bin 10 s). The apparent diﬀerent count-rate at the
bottom of the eclipse between this and the upper ﬁgure is due to
the diﬀerent time binning.

veriﬁed a posteriori that a diﬀerent choices of the time binning
would not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the results). As the eclipses of
IGR J17451–3022 are virtually rectangular (see Fig. 4), a ﬁt
to each of the two eclipses was carried out using the same
technique described by Bozzo et al. (2007) in the case of the
eclipsing LMXB 4U 2129+47. The model we developed to ﬁt
rectangular eclipses treats the mean source count-rate outside
(Fmax) and inside (Fmin) the eclipse as free parameters, together
with the mid-eclipse epoch (T0) and the duration of the eclipse
(D). We performed a minimization of the obtained χ2 value from
the ﬁt to the data by using our dedicated IDL routine. The model
was integrated over each time bin before computing the χ2, in
order to take data binning into account. The routine samples the
χ2 hyper-surface in a ﬁne grid of values before computing the
variance between the model and the data for each set of param-
eters. The latter is then used to determine the local χ2 minima
in the 4D parameter space. The best ﬁts to the two mid-eclipse
epochs were found to be T0(a)=57087.32320±0.00001 MJD
The
and
corre-
sponding eclipse durations were D(a)=821.89+1.86
−1.95 s and
D(b)=822.66+1.89
−2.04 s. We show the relevant contour plots for the
ﬁts to the two eclipses in Fig. 6. From these measurements, we
estimated the orbital period of the system as Porb=22620.5+2.0
−1.8 s

T0(b)=57087.5850110±0.00001 MJD.

intervals of the dips and the eclipses). The phenomenological model used here comprises a diskbb component, plus the absorption in
the direction of the source (tbabs in Xspec) and all the required Gaussian absorption lines to take into account the residuals visible
in Fig. 7. We also report the results of the ﬁts carried out with the same model on the time resolved spectra extracted by dividing the
steady emission in 5 time intervals. The latter are indicated in the ﬁrst row of the table in ks from the beginning of the observation
(see the lightcurve in Fig. 4). EW indicates the equivalent width of each Gaussian line. All uncertainties are given at 90% c.l.

of signiﬁcant spectral variability. We also noticed that, owing
to the reduced statistics of these spectra, obtaining meaningful
ﬁts in the 6-8 keV range was particularly challenging due to the
blending of several lines.

The spectral analysis of the X-ray dips was carried out sep-
arately, as the hardness ratio (HR) calculated from the soft (0.5-
2.5 keV) and hard (2.5-12.0 keV) X-ray lightcurves of the source
as a function of the orbital phase provided clear evidence for
spectral variability during these events (see Fig. 8). We extracted
orbital phase resolved spectra during phases corresponding to
the HR variations: 0.61-0.65, 0.65-0.68, 0.68-0.75, 0.75-0.82,
and 0.82-0.85. In all cases a reasonable good ﬁt (χ2
red=0.9-1.2)
could be obtained with an absorbed diskbb model. Owing to the
poor statistics of these spectra (integration times of few ks) we
could not measure signiﬁcant changes in the temperature and
radius of the diskbb component, neither in the absorption col-
umn density. Furthermore, several absorption lines appeared as
blended and thus we were unable to constrain within a reason-
able accuracy their parameters in the ﬁts. In order to clarify
the origin of the HR increase close to the dips (as visible in
Fig. 8), we extracted a single spectrum by combining orbital
phases between 0.65 and 0.82. This spectrum revealed a modest
(but signiﬁcant) increase in the column density of both the neu-

tral and the additional ionized absorber. This is discussed more
in Sect. 4.2.1.

We also extracted the source spectrum during the two
eclipses. Since in this case the source ﬂux was signiﬁcantly
lower, we also made use of the spectra extracted from the
two MOS cameras and ﬁt them together with the EPIC-pn
(the integration time was too short
to obtain meaningful
spectra from the two RGSs and thus we did not include these
data in the combined ﬁt). The spectrum could be equally

4.2.1. A physical spectral model

The spectral properties of the source analyzed in Sect. 4.2, to-
gether with the characteristics of the lightcurve discussed in
Sect. 4.1, are strongly reminiscent of high inclination LMXBs
with absorbing/outﬂowing material located above the accretion
disk (see Sect. 5). In order to provide a more physical descrip-
tion of the spectral energy distribution of IGR J17451–3022, we
made use of a model comprising a diskbb component which is
aﬀected by both the Galactic absorption and a local “warm”
absorber (warmabs4 in Xspec). This model takes into account
the ionization status of the gas, its turbulent broadening veloc-
ity, its bulk velocity (through the measurement of redshifted or
blueshifted lines), and the abundance of the diﬀerent materials
with respect to Solar values. Following the identiﬁcation of sev-
eral absorption lines in Sect. 4.2, we left free to vary in the ﬁt
the abundances corresponding to Si, S, Ar, Ca, Mn, K, and Fe.
A cabs component, accounting for Compton scattering (not in-
cluded in warmabs), was also added to the ﬁt. We ﬁxed the col-
umn density of this component to be the same of the warbmabs
multiplied by a factor of 1.21 to take roughly into account the
number of electrons per hydrogen atom (in case of Solar abun-
dances; see, e.g. D´ıaz Trigo et al. 2014, and references therein).
We changed the default ionizing continuum in warmabs, that is
a power-law of photon index Γ=2, with a blackbody ionizing
continuum with kT∼1.2 keV. Even though the source might un-
dergo some spectral state transitions characterized by a non ther-
mal power-law like component, this does not seem the case for
most of the outburst (see Sect. 2). As it is not possible to se-
lect a diskbb component as a ionizing continuum in the warmabs
model, we considered that the available blackbody continuum
with a similar temperature was a reasonably good approximation
in the case of IGR J17451–3022 (as also done in other sources,
see e.g. D´ıaz Trigo & Boirin 2013). We also assumed 1012 cm−3
for the ionized medium density, a value typically used in LMXBs
(see, e.g., D´ıaz Trigo et al. 2014). The drop in the source X-ray
emission at energies &9 keV that required the addition of a gabs
component in the phenomenological model was completely ac-
counted for by the addition of the warmabs model. We included
in the ﬁt an additional edge at ∼8.2 keV to minimize the residu-
als still visible around this energy and two absorption Gaussian
lines with centroid energies of ∼5.7 keV and ∼6.1 keV. The lat-
ter improved the ﬁt to the Cr and Mn lines, which were not fully
taken into account by the warmabs component. This model pro-
vided an acceptable result (see Table 4). The residuals left from
this ﬁt did not suggest the presence of additional spectral com-
ponents, even though some structures remained visible close to
the iron lines at 6.7-7.0 keV (see Fig. 9). Such structures might
result from a non-optimal description of the complex absorbing
medium in IGR J17451–3022 through the warmabs model, e.g.
due to the presence of diﬀerent broadening or outﬂowing veloc-
ities.

We used the best ﬁt model also to characterize the spectrum
extracted during the orbital phases corresponding to the dips and
the most evident HR variations (0.65-0.72 and 0.72-0.82, see
Sect. 4.2). This allowed a more physical comparison between
the average emission of the source and the emission during the
dips. Owing to the reduced statistics of the dip spectrum, we
ﬁxed in the ﬁt those parameters that could not be constrained to
the values determined from the average spectrum. The results of
this ﬁt, summarized in Table 4, suggest that the dips are likely

emission from IGR J17451–3022 (excluding the time intervals
corresponding to the eclipses and the dips) with the physical
model described in Sect. 4.2.1. We show here the unfolded spec-
trum. The residuals from the ﬁt are shown in the bottom panel.

4.3. Timinganalysis

We also performed a timing analysis of the EPIC-pn data to
search for coherent signals. We ﬁrst reported all photons ar-
rival times to the Solar system barycentre using the Chandra
position of the source (see Sect. 1). The orbital motion of
the compact object limits the length of the time series over
which a search for periodicities can be performed without tak-
ing into account the Doppler shift induced by the motion of the
source. To evaluate such a time interval we calculated Eq. 21
of Johnston & Kulkarni (1991) for an orbital period of Porb =
6.28 hr and an inclination i ∼ 80◦, obtaining:

Assuming the case of a signal with a putative frequency of
ν = 300 Hz, described by m = 1 harmonic and emitted by an
object orbiting around a M2 ∼ 0.3M⊙ companion star (Zdziarski
et al. 2016, in preparation), we then calculated a Fourier power
spectrum in intervals of length ∆tbest = 448.6 s. The time series
was sampled at eight times the minimum time resolution of the
timing mode of the EPIC-pn (tres = 2.952 × 10−5 s), obtaining
a value of the Nyquist frequency, νNy = (8tres)−1/2 = 2117 Hz.
We then inspected frequencies up to νNy (with a frequency reso-
best = 2.2 × 10−3 Hz) to search for a coherent
lution of δν = 1/∆t∗
periodic signal, but found none signiﬁcant with an upper limit
on the pulse amplitude of A < 12.5% (3σ c.l.).

In order to improve the sensitivity to pulsed signals emit-
ted by a source in a binary system, we used a quadratic co-
herence recovery technique (QCRT), following the guidelines
given by Wood et al. (1991) and Vaughan et al. (1994). Such a
technique is based on the correction of the photon arrival times
with a quadratic transformation, under the assumption that the
sinusoidal Doppler modulation introduced by the orbital mo-
tion can be approximated by a parabola over a time interval
short enough. To estimate such a length we calculated Eq. 22 of
Johnston & Kulkarni (1991) for the same parameters mentioned
above:

∆tbest = 1636(cid:18)

In order to increase the speed of the power spectrum calcula-
tion, we considered a value of the interval length equal to a
power of two of the time resolution of the time series, ∆tbest =
226tres = 1981, and divided the time series into Nintv = 20 in-
tervals. Before performing a signal search, the arrival times of
the X-ray photons in each of these intervals were corrected us-
ing a quadratic relation t′ = αt2. The parameter α was varied in
best) = 6 × 10−11s−1, into a range
steps equal to δα = 1/(2νNy∆t2
determined by consideration on the possible size of the two
components. Calculating the expression given by Wood et al.
(1991) for Porb = 6.28 hr, we considered αmax = αmin =
1.54 × 10−7[M2/(M1 + M2)][(M1 + M2)/M⊙]1/3s−1. Assuming
as example values M1 = 1.7M⊙, and M2 = 0.3M⊙, we obtained
αmax = αmin = 2.9 × 10−8 s. The number of preliminary ar-
rival times correction made on each of the Nintv = 20 time in-
tervals, is then Nα = 2αmax/δα = 967. A power spectrum was
produced for each of these trial corrections, inspecting frequen-
cies up to νNy = (8tres)−1/2 = 2117 Hz with a resolution of
δν = 1/∆tbest = 1/(226tres) = 5 × 10−4 Hz, giving a total num-
ber of frequencies trials equal to Nν = νNy/δν = 222. The total
number of trials is then NintvNαNν = 8.1 × 1010, and assuming
that in the absence of any signal the noise in the power spectrum
is distributed as a χ2 with two degrees of freedom, we then set a
post-trial detection level at 3σ conﬁdence level of Pdet = 62.1.
No signal was signiﬁcantly detected and upper limits of ≃ 5%
(3σ c.l.) were typically found in the diﬀerent time intervals.

5. Discussion

We reported on the analysis of the X-ray data collected during
the ﬁrst outburst of the INTEGRAL transient IGR J17451–3022.
The source displayed a relatively soft X-ray emission during
most of the event (lasting about 9 months) and thus it was not
signiﬁcantly detected by the hard X-ray imager IBIS/ISGRI on-
board INTEGRAL. The only exception is the time interval corre-
sponding to the satellite revolution 1458 where the source under-
went a possible spectral state transition and its X-ray emission
was recorded up to ∼100 keV. During the INTEGRAL revolution
1458, the spectrum of the source could be well described by us-
ing a relatively hard power-law, with a photon index of Γ ∼ 2.
During all the remaining outburst phases covered by INTEGRAL
the source was only signiﬁcantly detected in by JEM-X at en-
ergies .10 keV. The average JEM-X spectrum, however, was
characterized by a low statistics and did not permit a clear dis-
tinction between diﬀerent possible spectral models. The JEM-X
data showed, nevertheless, that the X-ray ﬂux of the source re-
mained relatively stable in the 3-10 keV energy band and com-
patible with that recorded by Swift /XRT before the beginning of
the outburst decay.

The Swift /XRT observations covered a large part of the
source outburst, excluding the time period 2014 November to
2015 February when the visibility of the Galactic center was lim-
ited by Sun constraints. XRT data did not reveal any dramatic
spectral change in the X-ray emission from the source during
the outburst. Its spectrum was dominated by a thermal compo-
nent, interpreted as being due to the presence of an accretion
disk. The hard X-ray emission recorded during the INTEGRAL
revolution 1458 could thus have been due to a temporary spec-
tral state transition of the source, similarly to what is often ob-
served during the outbursts of neutron star (NS) and black-hole
(BH) LMXBs (see, e.g., Done et al. 2007; Mu˜noz-Darias et al.
2014, for recent reviews). Due to the lack of a simultaneous cov-
erage with focusing X-ray instruments during the INTEGRAL

E. Bozzo et al.: IGR J17451–3022: a dipping and eclipsing low mass X-ray binary

revolution 1458 and the availability of spectra with suﬃciently
high statistics we could not investigate this possible spectral state
transition in more details.

The same spectral component that dominated all XRT spec-
tra was also detected in the XMM-Newton observation of the
source carried out in 2015 March. The EPIC data clearly showed
the presence of a number of absorption features, the most evident
ones being centered at the known energies of the Fe XXV/Fe
XXVI Kα and Kβ complexes. Similar features are observed in a
number of LMXBs hosting either a NS or a BH, and are usually
ascribed to the presence of an ionized absorbing material located
above the accretion disk (Ueda et al. 1998; Kotani et al. 2000;
Sidoli et al. 2001; Parmar et al. 2002; Boirin & Parmar 2003;
Boirin et al. 2004, 2005; Hyodo et al. 2008). Such absorbers are
more likely to be observed in high inclination systems (&70 deg;
see, e.g., Ponti et al. 2012, 2014; D’A`ı et al. 2014), where our
line of sight passes directly through the disk. In some cases,
the absorption features show signiﬁcant blueshifts, thus indicat-
ing that the ionized material is emerging from the system as
a “disk wind” (see, e.g., Schulz & Brandt 2002; Kubota et al.
2007; D´ıaz Trigo et al. 2007; Iaria et al. 2008). Diﬀerent driving
mechanisms have been proposed to generate disk winds (see,
e.g., Proga & Kallman 2002). These comprise a combination of
radiation and thermal pressure, best suited to explain disk winds
forming at distances of &1010-1012 cm from the central compact
object, or magnetic eﬀects. The latter consider that the disk wind
can be produced at relatively small distances from the compact
object (.109-1010 cm) due to the pressure generated by the mag-
netic viscosity internal to the disk or magnetocentrifugal forces
(Miller et al. 2006). In all cases, the presence of an ionized ab-
sorbing material can be accounted for in the spectral analysis of
high inclination LMXBs by using the warmabs model in Xspec.
The ﬁt with this model that we carried out on the IGR J17451–
3022 data in Sect. 4.2.1 revealed that the warm absorber in
≃ 1024 cm−2, a
this source has a column density of Nwarmabs
turbulent velocity of σv ≃ 290 km s−1, and a bulk velocity
v ≃ 2200 km s−1. The latter value indicates that this material is
moving away from the disk and can thus be most likely associ-
ated to a disk wind. We note here that, even though the measured
outﬂowing velocity in Table 4 is highly signiﬁcant, the corre-
sponding shift in energy of the involved lines is modest (about
0.7% of the centroid energy) and is roughly of the same order of
magnitude of the EPIC-pn calibration energy accuracy. For this
reason, any interpretation about the presence of an outﬂowing
velocity of the order of few thousands of km s−1 measured with
the EPIC-pn has to be taken with caution.

H

From the estimated column density and ionization parame-
ter of the warm absorber, we can also infer some information on
the distance of this material from the compact object by using
the deﬁnition of the ionization parameters ξ = LX/ner2, where
LX is the source X-ray luminosity, ne≃1012 cm−3 is the medium
density assumed in the warmabs model, and r is the distance be-
tween the absorbing medium and the central source. Making use
of the best ﬁt values in Table 4, we obtain r ≃ 2.0 × 1010 cm, that
is an intermediate value of the ionized absorber distance from the
central compact object dividing thermal/radiative and magnetic
models.

We caution, however, that the distance to IGR J17451–3022
is not known at present (thus potentially leading on large un-
certainties on the estimated X-ray luminosity of the source) and
that the above calculation depends on the density assumed for
the partly ionized absorbing medium (see Sect. 4.2.1). Disk
winds are usually observed in bright LMXBs hosting a BH
in the radio-free high soft state (HSS) or a NS with a lu-

minosity LX & 0.15LEdd (here LEdd is the Eddington lumi-
nosity for an accreting NS; see, e.g., Ponti et al. 2012, 2014,
2015, and references therein). The X-ray luminosity estimated
from the unabsorbed XMM-Newton ﬂux of IGR J17451–3022 is
LX ≃ 4.3 × 1036(D/8 kpc)2 erg s−1, i.e about 2% of the typical
Eddington luminosity for a NS and a relatively low luminosity
for a Galactic BH in the HSS (see, e.g. Done et al. 2007, for a
recent review). This suggests that IGR J17451–3022 might be lo-
cated well beyond the Galactic Center, i.e. at distances ≫8 kpc.
The lack of optical/radio/IR observations during the outburst of
IGR J17451–3022 (at the best of our knowledge) prevents, at
present, a more accurate estimate of the source distance. We note
that, as in order sources seen at high inclination, it is also possi-
ble that only a fraction of the intrinsic X-ray luminosity arrives
to the observer (see, e.g., Burderi et al. 2010), thus increasing
our uncertainty concerning the source localization and the in-
terpretation on its real nature. Concerning the assumed value of
ne, we commented in Sect. 4.2.1 that ∼1012 cm−3 is a reason-
able estimate based on our knowledge of similar systems. Direct
measurements of the plasma density in LMXBs displaying the
presence of pronounced absorption features could be obtained
so far only in two cases, and thus we cannot rule out substan-
tially diﬀerent values of ne (see D´ıaz Trigo & Boirin 2015, and
references therein).

At odds with other LMXBs seen at high inclinations and
characterized by dense coronae (see, e.g. D´ıaz Trigo & Boirin
2013), we found no evidence for either a broad iron emission
line or a reﬂection component produced close to the inner disk
boundary in IGR J17451–3022. The prominence of these fea-
tures is a strong function of the system inclination and might
become undetectable at &80 deg (see, e.g., Garc´ıa et al. 2014).
We found evidence for an edge at ∼8.2 keV (see Table 4) that
could be due to Fe XXV, even though the measured energy is
lower than expected (8.828 keV; see, e.g., di Salvo et al. 2009,
for a similar case). An alternative possibility is that the residu-
als around this energy are left due to a poorly accurate ﬁt with
the warmabs model, especially in a energy range where the ef-
fective area of the EPIC-pn camera is decreasing rapidly and the
signal-to-noise ratio of the data is far from being optimal (see
Fig. 9).

The analysis of the EPIC-pn data revealed also the presence
of two virtually rectangular eclipses in the source lightcurve,
lasting about 820 s each. From the measurement of the two
eclipse mid-epochs we provided an estimate of the source or-
bital period at 22620.5+2.0
−1.8 s (1σ c.l.; see Sect. 4.1). The residual
X-ray ﬂux measured during the eclipses (about 6% of the av-
eraged uneclipsed ﬂux) could in principle be explained by the
presence of an accretion disk corona (ADC) located above the
disk that scatters the X-rays from the central point-like source.
However, as the X-ray spectrum extracted during the eclipse
could be equally well ﬁt with a diskbb or a power-law model, we
are unable to distinguish if this residual emission corresponds to
a fraction of the scattered thermal X-rays from the disk or if there
is also some signiﬁcant reprocessing within the ADC with an
eventual contribution from a scattering halo. This phenomenol-
ogy is remarkably similar to that observed in the case of the NS
LMXB EXO 0748-676, which shows rectangular eclipses with
a 4% residual X-ray ﬂux (during X-ray active periods; see, e.g.,
Parmar & White 1988).

IGR J17451–3022 also show remarkable similarities with
the dips in EXO 0748-676. In both systems, the dips precede in
phase the X-ray eclipse and display complex structures varying
from one orbit to the other. They also give rise to measurable

changes in the hardness ratio of the source emission, which is
interpreted in terms of increased absorption due to the presence
of vertically extended structures in the disk at
the impact
point of the accretion stream from the donor star. It is worth
noticing that EXO 0748-676 also displayed clear evidence for
the presence of an ionized absorbing material located above
the accretion disk, even though no signiﬁcant blueshift of the
detected absorption features could be measured in that case
(Ponti et al. 2014).

Both the search for X-ray bursts and for pulsations resulted
in non-detections, leaving the nature of the compact object in
IGR J17451–3022 unclear (see Sect. 2 and 4.3). As disk winds
are nowadays understood to be an ubiquitous property of many
NS and BH LMXBs observed at high inclination, this feature
cannot be used to distinguish easily among the two possibil-
ities in the case of IGR J17451–3022. The analysis of the X-
ray continuum from the source could, however, provide some
additional clues. In particular, the normalization of the diskbb
model in the XMM-Newton and Swift data is found to be al-
ways .20 and thus we can infer an approximate inner disk
boundary of 12(d/8 kpc)(cos(θ/85 deg))(−1/2) km. Even when
the usual color and torque-free boundary corrections are consid-
ered for the diskbb component (see, e.g., Gierli´nski et al. 1999;
Nowak et al. 2012, and references therein), the inner disk bound-
ary estimated from the X-ray spectrum of IGR J17451–3022 re-
mains uncomfortably small for a black-hole (less than 2 rg for a
3 M⊙ BH). Although this does not allow us to draw a ﬁrm con-
clusion about the nature of the compact object in IGR J17451–
3022, we conclude that the NS hypothesis is favoured (see also
Zdziarski et al. 2016, in preparation).
