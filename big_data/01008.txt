DEFORMATION THEORY OF K-THEORETIC CYCLES

SEN YANG

Abstract. By using higher K-theory, we study deformation the-
ory of K-theoretic cycles. As an application, we answer aﬃrma-
tively the following three questions posed by Mark Green and
Phillip Griﬃths :

• (1). How to deﬁne tangent space to algebraic cycles T Z q(X)

in general ?

• (2). Obstruction issues(V.S. Hilbert scheme);
• (3). Extend Soul´e’s variant of Bloch-Quillen identiﬁcation
from smooth projective varieties to their inﬁnitesimal neigh-
borhoods.

Question (1) and (2) are asked in Chap 10 of [10] and question

(3) is suggested on page 471 of [9].

The highlight is the appearance of negative K-groups which de-

tects the obstructions for deformation of cycles.

1. Introduction

Let f : X → S be a smooth projective morphism, where S =
Spec(k[[t]]) and k is a ﬁeld of characteristic 0. Let Xj = X ×S Sj,
where Sj = Spec(k[t]/tj+1), we have the following natural diagram

Xj

fj−−−→ Xj+1

ij+1−−−→ X

y

Sj −−−→ Sj+1 −−−→ S.

y

y

We use X to denote X0, and call the family {Xj}j a deformation of
X, where Xj is called the j-th inﬁnitesimal neighborhood of X.
In
particular, the family {Xj}j is a trivial deformation of X, if, for each
j, Xj = X ×k Sj.

The following question is posed by Green-Griﬃths in [10]:

Question 1.1. How to deﬁne tangent space to Z q(X) in general ?

Since the abelian group Z q(X) is not a complex manifold or a scheme,
so the known deformation theory, such as Kodaira-Spencer theory or
the theory of Hilbert schemes, can’t apply to this question directly. In
our approach, Z q(−) is considered as a functor and we ﬁrstly attempt
to deﬁne the tangent space to this functor as usual

T Z q(X) := Ker{Z q(X × Spec(k[ε])) ε=0−−→ Z q(X)}.

Unfortunately, the classical deﬁnition of algebraic cycles can’t dis-
tinguish nilpotent, Z q(X × Spec(k[ε])) = Z q(X), so this deﬁnition is
clearly not the desired one.

Green-Griﬃths has answered this question for q = 1 and q = dim(X)
In Chapter 3, we answer this question aﬃrmatively which

in [10].
generalizes Green-Griﬃths’ deﬁnitions, see Diﬁnition 3.1.

Considering an element τ ∈ T Z q(X) as a ﬁrst order deformation,
Green-Griﬃths asks whether we can successively deform τ to inﬁnite
order. It is well-known that the deformation of a subvariety Y , consid-
ered as an element of the Hilbert scheme Hilb(X), can be obstructed.
However, Green-Griﬃths predicts that we can eliminate obstructions
by considering Y as an element of Z q(X):

Question 1.2. T Z q(X) is unobstructed. See Section 4.1 for precise
statement.

We answer this question aﬃrmatively in Section 4.1.

DEFORMATION THEORY OF K-THEORETIC CYCLES

One Fundamental tool in Green-Griﬃths’ study is the Soul´e’s variant

of the Bloch-Quillen identiﬁcation

CH q(X)Q = H q(X, K M

q (OX))Q,

here K M

q (OX) is the Milnor K-theory sheaf associated to the presheaf

U → K M

q (OX(U)).

On page 471 of [9] , Green-Griﬃths suggested that it would be in-

teresting to extend this formula to inﬁnitesimal thickenings.

Question 1.3. Let Xj denote the j-th inﬁnitesimal thickening, do we
have the following identiﬁcation

CH q(Xj)Q = H q(Xj, K M

q (OXj ))Q ?

The answer is “No” for the calssical Chow groups, since the classical

Chow groups can’t detect nilpotent. To be precise, we have

CH q(X) = CH q(Xj).

On the other hand, we know that

H q(X, K M

q (OX)) 6= H q(Xj, K M

q (OXj )).

We have answered this question for trivial deformatons in [20]. In

Section 2, we shall answer this question in general, see Theorem 2.7.

These three questions inspire us to propose a new deﬁnition of Chow
groups capturing the nilpotent which is useful for studying deformation
problems. Bearing nilpotent in mind, we look at the derived category
Dperf(X) obtained from the exact category of perfect complexes of OX-
modules. It is obvious that the derived category Dperf(X) is diﬀerent
from Dperf(Xj). The idea of constructing Chow groups in terms of
Dperf(X), considered as a tensor triangulated category, has been pro-
posed by Balmer [3] and followed by Klein [12] and the author [20].

We further push-forward the idea in [20] and answer Green-Griﬃths’

above questions aﬃrmatively.

Notations and conventions.
(1). K-theory used in this note will be Thomason-Trobaugh non-
connective K-theory [17], if not stated otherwise. For any abelian group
M, MQ denotes the image of M in M ⊗Z Q. Spec(k[ε]) denotes the
dual number, ε2 = 0.

(2). The notations f, fj, ij+1 introduced in the beginning of the intro-
duction, are valid through this note: f : X → S is a smooth projective
morphism, where S = Spec(k[[t]]) and k is a ﬁeld of characteristic 0.

Letting Xj = X ×S Sj, where Sj = Spec(k[t]/tj+1), fj and ij+1 are the
natural maps in the following natural diagram

We use X to denote X0, if not stated otherwise, and call the family
{Xj}j a deformation of X, where Xj is called the j-th inﬁnitesimal
neighborhood of X. In particular, the family {Xj}j is a trivial defor-
mation of X, if, for each j, Xj = X ×k Sj. We always assume X has
dimension d.

2. Deformation of cycles in general

2.1. Milnor K-theoretic Chow groups. Let X be a noetherian
scheme over a ﬁeld of ﬁnite Krull dimension d. As explained in [2],
one can ﬁlter the tensor triangulated category L = Dperf(X) by dimen-
sion of support

· · · ⊂ L(p)(X) ⊂ L(p+1)(X) ⊂ · · · ⊂ L,

where L(p)(X) is deﬁned to be

L(p)(X) := {E ∈ Dperf(X) | codimKrull(supph(E)) ≥ −p}.

Let (L(p)(X)/L(p−1)(X))# denote the idempotent completion of the

Verdier quotient L(p)(X)/L(p−1)(X).

Theorem 2.1. [1] For each p ∈ Z, localization induces an equivalence

(L(p)(X)/L(p−1)(X))# ≃ Gx∈X (−p)

Dperf

x

(X)

between the idempotent completion of the quotient L(p)(X)/L(p−1)(X)
and the coproduct over x ∈ X (−p) of the derived category of perfect
complexes of OX,x-modules with homology supported on the closed point
x ∈ Spec(OX,x).

The short sequence

L(p−1)(X) → L(p)(X) → (L(p)(X)/L(p−1)(X))#,

which is exact up to summand, induces the following homotopy ﬁbra-
tion of K-theory spectrum:

K(L(p−1)(X)) → K(L(p)(X)) → K((L(p)(X)/L(p−1)(X))#).

DEFORMATION THEORY OF K-THEORETIC CYCLES

As pointed in [2], this ﬁbration gives rise to a long exact sequence:

· · · → Kn(L(p−1)(X)) → Kn(L(p)(X)) i

−→ Kn((Lp(X)/Lp−1(X))#) k

−→ Kn−1(L(p−1)(X)) → . . . ,

which produces an exact couple as usual and then gives rise to the
associated coniveau spectral sequence with E1-term:

1 = K−p−q((L(−p)(X)/L(−p−1)(X))#),

Ep,q
the diﬀerential dp,q
1

is the composition dp,q
:K−p−q((L(−p)(X)/L(−p−1)(X))#) k

1 = i ◦ k as usual

−→ K−p−q−1(L(−p−1)(X))

i
−→ K−p−q−1((L(−p−1)(X)/L(−p−2)(X))#).

Deﬁnition 2.2. [2] For X a noetherian scheme over a ﬁeld of ﬁnite
Krull dimension d and for each integer q satisfying 1 ≤ q ≤ d + 1, the
q-th Gersten complex Gq is deﬁned to be the −qth line of E1-page of
the above coniveau spectral sequence

Gq : 0 → Mx∈X (0)

Kq(OX,x) → · · · → Mx∈X (q−1)

K1(OX,x on x)

K0(OX,x on x)

dq,−q

1,X−−−→ Mx∈X (q+1)

K−1(OX,x on x) → · · ·

dq−1,−q

1,X−−−−−→ Mx∈X (q)
→ Mx∈X (d)

Kq−d(OX,x on x) → 0.

The q-th augmented Gersten complex, still denoted Gq by abuse of

notations, is deﬁned to be the following complex,

Gq : 0 → Kq(X) → Mx∈X (0)

Kq(OX,x) → · · · → Mx∈X (q−1)

K1(OX,x on x)

K0(OX,x on x)

dq,−q

1,X−−−→ Mx∈X (q+1)

K−1(OX,x on x) → · · ·

dq−1,−q

1,X−−−−−→ Mx∈X (q)
→ Mx∈X (d)

Kq−d(OX,x on x) → 0.

Let X[t, t−1] = X ×Z Z[t, t−1], we have also the following homotopy

ﬁbration of K-theory spectrum:
K(L(p−1)(X[t, t−1])) → K(L(p)(X[t, t−1])) → K((L(p)(X[t, t−1])/L(p−1)(X[t, t−1]))#).

Mimicking the argument in [17], chap 6, Lemma 6.3, we have the

maps

∪t : K(L(p−1)(X)) → ΩK(L(p−1)(X[t, t−1])),

∪t : K(L(p)(X)) → ΩK(L(p)(X[t, t−1])).

These two maps induce the following one
∪t : K((L(p)(X)/L(p−1)(X))#) → ΩK((L(p)(X[t, t−1])/L(p−1)(X[t, t−1]))#).

6

SEN YANG

Consequently, we have the following map between coniveau spectral

sequences

∪t : Ep,q

1 (X) → Ep,q−1

1

(X[t, t−1]),

where Ep,q
K−p−q+1((L(−p)(X[t, t−1])/L(−p−1)(X[t, t−1]))#).

1 (X) = K−p−q((L(−p)(X)/L(−p−1)(X))#) and Ep,q−1

1

(X[t, t−1]) =

Therefore, ∪t gives rise to the following commutative diagram be-
tween augmented Gersten complexes, from now on, we write Y to re-
place X[t, t−1] for simplicity,

We assume X has an ample line bundle(so does Y ), then the non-
negative index part of the columns in the above diagram agrees with the
Gersten type complexes associated to the coniveau spectral sequences
constructed by Gillet [8], page 239,

0 → Kq+1(Y ) → My∈Y (0)

Kq+1(OY,y) → · · · → My∈Y (q)

K1(OY,y on y) → My∈Y (q+1)

K0(OY,y on y) → 0,

0 → Kq(X) → Mx∈X (0)

Kq(OX,x) → · · · → Mx∈X (q)

K0(OX,x on x) → 0.

We note that K∗(OX,x on x) agrees with Quillen K-groups with sup-
port deﬁned in Gillet [8], so Adams operations ψk exist on K∗(OX,x on x).
Furthmore, Adams operations ψk can decompose the above complexes
into direct sum of subcomplexes respectively, according to the eigen-
weight,

q+1(Y ) → My∈Y (0)

According to Weibel [18], we can extend Adams operations ψk to
negative K-groups by using Bass fundamental exact sequence, at the
price of tensoring with Q,

0 → K0(X) → K0(X[t])⊕K0(X[t−1]) → K0(X[t, t−1]) → K−1(X) → 0.

To be precise, given any η ∈ K−1(X), η · t ∈ K0(X[t, t−1]) , so after

tensoring with Q, Adams operations ψk on K−1(X) is deﬁned to be

ψk(η) :=

ψk(η · t)

kt

.

Adams operations on K−n(X), n ≥ 2, and on K-groups with support
in negative ranges can be deﬁned in the similar way.

Proposition 2.3. For X a d-dimensional noetherian scheme of ﬁnite
type over a ﬁeld and having an ample line bundle, the diﬀerentials
dp,−q
of the augmented Gersten complex(Deﬁnition 2.2) respect Adams

operations ψk. In other words, for every i ∈ Z, there exists the following

terms of eigenspaces of Adams operations in [20].

nite type over a ﬁeld and having an ample line bundle, the q-th Milnor

duced in Notations and conventions. The natural map

coniveau spectral sequences recalled in Section 2.1:

As a consequence, we have the following two theorems. The ﬁrst one

answers aﬃrmatively Green-Griﬃths’ Question 1.3

Theorem 2.7. Bloch’s formula :

CH M

q (Dperf(Xj)) = H q(Xj, K M

q (OXj ))Q.

Proof. It follows from the fact that the Zariski sheaﬁﬁcation of the right
column in the above diagram is a ﬂasque resolution of K M
q (OXj ). (cid:3)

The second one says Milnor K-theoretic cycles and Chow groups in

Deﬁnition 2.5 recover the classical ones for X:

Theorem 2.8. Compatiblity

q,rat(Dperf(X) = Z q

q (Dperf(X) = CH q(X)Q.
CH M

Proof. The Gersten complex corresponding to j = 0 agrees with the
classical one constructed by Quillen [15].
(cid:3)

2.3. Obstructions and negative K-groups. For each j, the j-th in-
ﬁnitesimal neighborhood Xj satisﬁes the assumptions of Deﬁnition 2.5,
so the q-th Milnor K-theoretic cycles of Xj is deﬁned to be

q (Dperf(Xj)) = Ker(dq,−q

1,Xj ).

Deﬁnition 2.9. Given ξj ∈ Z M

j (ξj+1) = ξj.

q (Dperf(Xj)), an element ξj+1 ∈ Z M

q (Dperf(Xj+1))

where Pxj

closed reduced scheme associated to {xj}.

Since {xj}red = {xj+1}red, when we deform from ξj to ξj+1, we really
deform the coeﬃcients, i.e, we deform from Pxj

Recall that the following short exact sequence from [6, 9]

given by

where Θj+1 is the (j + 1)-th order Kodaira-Spencer class and η(ξj) is
the arithematic cycle class of ξj. See page 471 and page 492 of [9] for
precise deﬁnitions of η(ξj) and Θj+1.

3. First order trivial deformation-tangent spaces

In this section, we look at trivial deformations and use it to study
tangent spaces to Z q(X). To ﬁx notations, Xj = X ×k Sj globally(this
is always true locally). To emphasize on ﬁrst order trivial deformation,
we use X[ε] to stand for X1, i.e., X[ε] = (X, OX[t]/(t2)).

3.1. Deﬁnition of tangent spaces. Recall that the tangent space to
a functor F , denoted T F (X), is deﬁned to be

T F (X) := Ker{F (X[ε]) ε=0−−→ F (X)}.

Theorem 2.8 guides us to the following deﬁnition:

18

Deﬁnition 3.1. The tangent space to q-cycles, denoted T Z q(X), is
deﬁned to be

T Z q(X) := T Z M

q (Dperf(X) = Ker{Z M

q (Dperf(X[ε]) ε=0−−→ Z M

q (Dperf(X)}.

Similarly, the tangent space to rational equivalent classes, denoted T Z q
is deﬁned to be

rat(X),

T Z q

rat(X) := T Z M

q,rat(Dperf(X) = Ker{Z M

q,rat(Dperf(X[ε]) ε=0−−→ Z M

q,rat(Dperf(X)}.

The following theorem is a trivial version of Theorem 2.6, which has

been proved in [20].

diagram in which the Zariski sheaﬁﬁcation of each column is a ﬂasque

Theorem 3.5. T CH q(X) agrees with the formal tangent space Tf CH q(X)
deﬁned by Bloch, where Tf CH q(X) = H q(X, Ωq−1

Proof. It immediately follows from the fact that the Zariski sheaﬁﬁca-
tion of the left column in Theorem 3.2 is a ﬂasque resolution.

Let Y be a curve with generic point y on X. Working in a Zariski
neighborhood of a point x, we may assume x ∈ Y = {y} and let f be
the local deﬁning equations for Y . An element of Arcs1(X) should be
a formal sum of pairs of the form

{div(f + εf1), g + εg1 |div(f +εf1)},

where f1 ∈ OX,x, g + εg1 ∈ (K(Y )[ε])∗ is a rational function on an
irreducible component of div(f + εf1) and furthermore we assume
div(f + εf1) and div(g + εg1) have no common curve components.

In order to identify elements of Arcs1(X) and Arcs2(X) as elements
of K-groups with support, we recall the following theorem, Exercise 5.7
of Thomason-Trobaugh [17].

Theorem 3.9. [17]

Let X be a scheme with an ample family of line bundles. Let i :
Y → X be a regular closed immersion ([SGA 6] VII Section 1) deﬁned
by ideal J. Suppose Y has codimension k in X. Then K(X on Y )
is homotopy equivalent to the Quillen K-theory of the exact category
of pseudo-coherent OX-modules supported on the subspace Y and of
Tor-dimension ≤ k on X.

Back to our situation, X is a surface and x is a point on X. Ac-
cording to this theorem, K0(OX,x[ε] on x[ε]) can be considered as a
K-group of the exact category of pseudo-coherent OX,x[ε]-modules sup-
ported on the subspace x[ε] and of Tor-dimension ≤ 2 on OX,x[ε].
Any element of Arcs2(X) is such a module, and can be considered
as an element of K0(OX,x[ε] on x[ε]). Noting K0(OX,x[ε] on x[ε])Q =
K M
0 (OX,x[ε] on x[ε]), any element of Arcs2(X) can be considered as an
element of K M

0 (OX,x[ε] on x[ε]).

Theorem 3.10.

Arcs2(X) ⊆ Mx[ε]∈X[ε](2)

K M

0 (OX,x[ε] on x[ε]).

Simillarly, the elements of Arcs1(X) can also be identiﬁed with el-
ements of K-group with support, see [21] Section 4 for more details,
where the elements of Arcs1(X) are called Green-Griﬃths’ arcs.

Remark 3.12. Let’s intuitively explain why we need to take the kernel
of d1,−1
1 (Dperf(X[ε])). When we deform Y1 and Y2, the
1,ε
intersection point x is deformed along both Y1 and Y2. This means there
exists some restrictions to deforming Y1 and Y2. Non-zero negative K-
groups certainly appear to capture these restrictions. (Y1 and Y2 can’t
be deformed irrelevantly, the deformation of Y1 should be compatible
with the deformation of Y2 at the intersection point)

26

SEN YANG

On other hands, for points on X, or 0-cycles on any d-dimensional
variety in general, the deformations of two points are irrelevant. So
there are no restrictions. Negative K-groups don’t appear because of
dimensional reason, see the diagram in Theorem 3.6.

Remark 3.13. One may ask why there is no necessary to take kernel
in Quillen’s or Soul´e ’s proofs of Bloch’s formula in [15, 16]. That’s
because negative K-groups are zero in this case, K−1(k(x)) = 0. Even
we take kernel, the cycles class group Z q(X) is still identiﬁed with

K0(k(x)).

Lx∈X (q)

3.4. Why use Milnor K-theory. In the following, we explain why we
use Milnor K-groups with support, i.e., certain eigenspaces of Thomason-
Trobaugh K-groups, not Quillen or Thomason-Trobaugh K-groups, to
deﬁne cycles and Chow groups in Deﬁnition 2.5.

• In 2012 Fall, the author met a question on describing cer-
tain eigenspaces of K-groups and he E-mailed this question to
Christophe Soul´e for help. In the replying E-mail, Christophe
Soul´e suggested that if the author’s question is true, then it
should be true for Milnor K-theory and guided the author to
read Theorem 5 in [16]:

In our setting, X is smooth projective over k, so the Gersten

complex has the form of

0 →Kq(X) → Mx∈X (0)

Kq(OX,x) → · · · → Mx∈X (q−1)

K1(OX,x on x)

→ Mx∈X (q)

K0(OX,x on x) → 0,

which agrees with the Gersten complex by Quillen [15] because
of D´evissage:

0 →Kq(X) → Mx∈X (0)

Kq(OX,x) → · · · → Mx∈X (q−1)

K1(k(x))

→ Mx∈X (q)

K0(k(x)) → 0.

Adams operations can decompose K0(OX,x on x) and K0(k(x))
into direct sums of eigenspaces respectively. Moreover, Riemann-
Roch without denominator, due to Soul´e [16], says

K (j)

0 (OX,x on x)Q = K (j−q)

0

(k(x))Q.

For j = q,

K (q)

0 (OX,x on x)Q = K (0)

0 (k(x))Q = K0(k(x))Q,

DEFORMATION THEORY OF K-THEORETIC CYCLES

27

This forces to

K (j)

0 (OX,x on x)Q = 0, for j 6= q.

So only K (q)

0 (OX,x on x)Q is needed to study Z q(X)Q.

• The above idea become clear when we look at 0-cycles on 3-fold.

To be precise,

cles.

4. Obstruction issues

4.1. Versus Hilbert scheme. Let Y ⊂ X be a subvariety of codi-
mension q, we consider the trivial deformation {Xj}j of X, i.e., Xj =
X ×k Sj for each j. Obstruction issues asks whether it is possible to
lift Y to Yj successively, where Yj ⊂ Xj with suitable assumptions.

It is a common phenomenon that obstructions can occur when doing
deformation, though the deformation of X is trivial. For example,

DEFORMATION THEORY OF K-THEORETIC CYCLES

29

considering Y as an element of Hilb(X), it is well known that the
tangent space TY Hilb(X) may be obstructed.

However, Green-Griﬃths predicts that we can eliminate obstructions
in their program [9, 10]. That is, considering Y as an element of Z q(X),
TY Z q(X) is unobstructed.

To be precise, Green-Griﬃths predicts that

Question 4.1. [10] page 187-190

There are essentially four (not mutually exclusive) possibilities:

• (i) T Z q(X) may be obstructed. That is, there exists some τ ∈
q (Dperf(Xj) for

T Z q(X) such that τ cannot be lifted to τj ∈ Z M
some j.

• (ii) T Z q(X) is unobstructed. That is, for any τ ∈ T Z q(X),
q (Dperf(Xj) successively, where j =

τ can be lifted to τj ∈ Z M
1, 2, · · · . In other words, τ can be lifted to a (τj)j ∈ lim←−Z M

q (DPerf(Xj)).

• (iiii) T Z q(X) is unobstructed, but there exists τ ∈ T Z q(X)
which is not the tangent to a geometric arc in Z q(X). That is,
q (DPerf(Xj)) in (ii) is not a geo-
every element (τj)j ∈ lim←−Z M
metric arc. See Deﬁnition 2.15 for the deﬁnition of geometric
arc.

• (iv) Every τ ∈ T Z q(X) is the tangent to a geometric arc in
q (DPerf(Xj)).

Z q(X). That is, τ can be lifted to (τj)j ∈ lim←−Z M
Moreover, (τj)j is a geometric arc.

For q = 1, this question was solved by Ting Fai Ng, a student of

Phillip Griﬃths and Mark Goresky, in his PhD thesis.

Theorem 4.2. [14]

Every τ ∈ T Z 1(X) is the tangent to a geometric arc in Z 1(X).

Because of the known examples occuring in q ≥ 2 in Chap 10 of

[10](page 189) and in Section 4 of [9], Green-Griﬃths observed that

Theorem 4.3. [10]

For q ≥ 2, there exits X and τ ∈ T Z q(X) which is not the tangent

to a geometric arc in Z q(X).

This means only possibilities (i)-(iii) can occur for q ≥ 2. Green-

Griﬃths conjectures that

Question 4.4. [10] page 190

30

SEN YANG

(ii) and (iii) above are the only possibilities that actually occur for

q ≥ 2.

To answer this question, we need the following theorem:

Theorem 4.5. For any integer n, let Xn = X ×k Sn, where Sn =
Spec(k[t]/(tn+1)). The commutative diagram in Theorem 2.6 is split-
ting.

Using this theorem, we answer Green-Griﬃths’ Question 1.2 aﬃr-

matively:

Theorem 4.6. T Z q(X) is unobstructed.

Proof. It immediately follows from that fact that the commutative di-
agram in Theorem 4.5 is splitting. To be precise, it follows from the
fact that dq,−q

Given any ξj ∈ Z M

Question 4.7. T Z q

rat(X) is unobstructed.

Still because of the splitting diagram in Theorem 4.5, we answer this

question aﬃrmatively:
Theorem 4.8. T Z q

rat(X) is unobstructed.

In fact, this theorem can be deduced trivially from Theorem 2.12 as

a corollary.

4.2. How obstructions arise in non-trivial deformations. Now,
we explain how obstructions arise in non-trivial deformations. For
Xj+1 = X ×S Sj+1, where Sj+1 = Spec(k[t]/tj+2), we recall that

L(−q)(Xj+1) := {E ∈ Dperf(Xj+1) | codimKrull(supph(E)) ≥ q}.

Recall that the Gersten complex in Theorem 2.6 is obtained from

the coniveau spectral sequence in Section 2.1, so the diﬀerential

dq,−q
1,Xj+1

: K0((L(−q)(Xj+1)/L(−q−1)(Xj+1))#) → K−1((L(−q−1)(Xj+1)/L(−q−2)(Xj+1))#)

is the composition i ◦ k:

K0((L(−q)(Xj+1)/L(−q−1)(Xj+1))#) k−→ K−1(L(−q−1)(Xj+1)) i−→ K−1((L(−q−1)(Xj+1)/L(−q−2)(Xj+1))#).

In other words,

dq,−q

1,Xj+1 : Mxj+1∈X (q)

j+1

K0(OXj+1,xj+1 on xj+1) → Mxj+1∈X (q+1)

j+1

K−1(OXj+1,xj+1 on xj+1)

is the composition i ◦ k:

Mxj+1∈X (q)

j+1

K0(OXj+1 ,xj+1 on xj+1) k−→ K−1(L(−q−1)(Xj+1)) i−→ Mxj+1∈X (q+1)

j+1

K−1(OXj+1 ,xj+1 on xj+1 ).

Consequently,

dq,−q

1,Xj+1 : Mxj+1∈X (q)

K M

0 (OXj+1,xj+1 on xj+1) → Mxj+1∈X (q+1)
