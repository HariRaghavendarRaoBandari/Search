INTRODUCTION

Quantum entanglement is a basic resource for various in-
formation processing protocols, such as superdense coding [1]
and teleportation [2]. The most important character of entan-
glement is its nonlocality[3], which intrigues lots of research
in this area[4–8]. One method to study the nonlocality is to
build Bell inequality, which has been proposed in [3] and de-
veloped in [9–11]. Recent progress in the ﬁelds like quan-
tum biology [12–16] and quantum thermodynamics [17–24]
reveal the particular role of coherence in quantum processing.
And the resource theory of coherence has been developed. To
quantitatively characterize properties of quantum coherence,
we need to quantify coherence in a given state. Thus, several
kinds of coherence measures are proposed in [25, 26], such
as l1 norm of coherence and relative entropy of coherence.
Besides, relationship between coherence and other quantum
correlations like quantum entanglement, mixedness, are also
established in [27–31] . Moreover, [32] has proposed the oper-
ational resource theory of quantum coherence, which provide
the physical interpretations to the coherence measures via the
transformation processes like coherence distillation.

The quantum coherence in multipartite systems has been in-
vestigated in [30] and the connections between coherence, dis-
cord, and entanglement has also been revealed in [30].(Please
see Fig 1). And it has been shown that the global unitary op-
erations do not outdo than the local unitary operations [30].
However, we investigate the quantum coherence in multipar-
tite system by building bell inequality to demonstrate the non-
local properties presented in quantum coherence. The main
problem that we address here is: how to build the bell type
inequality for both coherence measures. And we ﬁnd special
bell inequalities for product states in both coherence measures
based on the idea of bell inequality in entanglement theory.
Moreover, we show that the maximally entangled state also
violate such inequalities and get serval other results.

The paper is organized as follows. We start with providing
serval preliminaries in Sec. II. Sec. III demonstrate the bell
type inequality for l1 norm measure and the give an example
which violate this inequality. We give another bell inequality
for relative entropy in Sec.IV. Finally, we conclude in Sec. V
with a discussion on the results obtained in this work.

II. PRELIMINARIES

l1 norm and relative entropy measure(see [25]) .–

(1) l1 norm measure Cl1 is deﬁned by
|ρij|.

Cl1(ρ) := Xi6=j

(1)

(2) Relative entropy measure Cr is deﬁned by

Cr(ρ) := S(ρd) − S(ρ),

(2)
where S(ρ) = −Trρ log ρ is the von Neumann entropy of ρ
and ρd is the diagonal state of ρ.
In this paper, we consider the coherence in bipartite quan-
tum system. Since the measure of coherence depends on the
basis we choose, we must specify the basis we have chosen.
As we know, if we choose two observables X and Y in HA and
HB, respectively, then the eigenstate of X and Y can form a
local basis of HA ⊗ HB. For any two observable X and Y in
HA and HB, respectively, Cr(X, Y, ρAB) and Cl1(X, Y, ρAB)
denote Cr(ρAB) and Cl1 (ρAB) in the local basis formed by
X and Y. Besides, Cr(X, ρA) and Cl1(Y, ρA) denotes Cr(ρA)
and Cl1 (ρA) in the local basis formed by X. Cr(Y, ρB) and
Cl1(Y, ρB) are deﬁned similarly.

share an EPR pair: 1√2
servable: R and Q, Bob have two observable: S and T.
It is well-known that: in classical case, we have[9]:

(|01i − |10i),and Alice have two ob-

|E(QS + RS + RT − QT )| ≤ 2.

(3)

In quantum mechanic case, however, we have[9]:

|E(QS + RS + RT − QT )| ≤ 2√2.

And we can choose the observables to obtain the maximally
value 2√2. Take

R = X,S = (−Z − X)/√2;
Q = Z,T = (Z − X)/√2;
1 0 (cid:21), Z = (cid:20) 1 0

0 −1 (cid:21), then we obtain 2√2.

where X = (cid:20) 0 1

More about bell inequality can be seen in [8].

III. BELL TYPE INEQUALITY IN l1 NORM CASE

Let us start from the state |00i in HA⊗HB with dimHA =
dimHB = d. We consider a global unitary operation U and a
local unitary operations V1⊗ V2, it is easy to show that for any
global unitary operation U , there always exists a local unitary
operation V1 ⊗ V2 such that

Cl1(U |00i) = Cl1 (V1 ⊗ V2 |00i),

(5)

which is very different from the entanglement case as local
unitary can not increase the entanglement. Thus, it seems that
the global unitary operations can not be better than local uni-
tary operations for quantum coherence. However, we ﬁnd the
following theorem to demonstrate the nonlocality of coher-
ence in some sense.
Theorem 1. In two qubit system HA⊗HB, if the global state
ρAB is product state ρA ⊗ ρB ∈ D (HA ⊗ HB), then for any
observables R, Q in HA and observables S, T in HB, we have:

[Cl1(Q, S, ρAB) + 1] + [Cl1(R, S, ρAB) + 1]
+[Cl1(R, T, ρAB) + 1] − [Cl1(Q, T, ρAB) + 1] ≤ 8. (6)
Furthermore, if ρAB is the maximally entangled state in HA⊗
HB, then there exist observable R, Q in HA and S, T in HB,
such that

[Cl1(Q, S, ρAB) + 1] + [Cl1(R, S, ρAB) + 1]
+[Cl1(R, T, ρAB) + 1] − [Cl1(Q, T, ρAB) + 1] > 8. (7)

Proof. When ρAB = ρA ⊗ ρB, we have the following fact,
Cl1(X, Y, ρA ⊗ ρB) + 1 = (Cl1 (X, ρA) + 1)(Cl1(Y, ρB) + 1)

Then,

[Cl1 (Q, S, ρA ⊗ ρB) + 1] + [Cl1(R, S, ρA ⊗ ρB) + 1]
+ [Cl1 (R, T, ρA ⊗ ρB) + 1] − [Cl1 (Q, T, ρA ⊗ ρB) + 1]
= (Cl1 (Q, ρA) + 1)(Cl1(S, ρB) + 1)
+(Cl1 (R, ρA) + 1)(Cl1 (S, ρB) + 1)
+(Cl1 (R, ρA) + 1)(Cl1 (T, ρB) + 1)
−(Cl1 (Q, ρA) + 1)(Cl1(T, ρB) + 1)

For simplicity, let us take:

WQ = Cl1(Q, ρA) + 1; WS = Cl1 (S, ρB) + 1;
WR = Cl1(R, ρA) + 1; WT = Cl1(T, ρB) + 1

And 1 ≤ WX ≤ 2, for X = Q, R, S, T .

Hence, the absolute value of above equation is equal to:

(4)

2

|WQWS + WRWS + WRWT − WQWT|

= |WQ(WS − WT ) + WR(WS + WT )|
≤ WQ|WS − WT| + WR|WS + WT|
≤ 8

i.e.

[Cl1 (Q, S, ρA ⊗ ρB) + 1] + [Cl1(R, S, ρA ⊗ ρB) + 1]

+ [Cl1 (R, T, ρA ⊗ ρB) + 1] − [Cl1(Q, T, ρA ⊗ ρB) + 1] ≤ 8 (8)
When ρAB is singlet state, i.e., |Ψi = 1√2

(|01i − |10i).

Take:

R : { | ψ+i, | ψ−i} ; S : { | +i, | −i} ;
Q : { | 0i, | 1i} ; T : { | 0i, | 1i} .

β (|+i − |0i), α =
where |ψ+i = 1
α (|+i + |0i),|ψ−i = 1
p2 + √2, β = p2 − √2. And |ψ+i ,|ψ−i are the eigen-
states of the observable (−Z − X)/√2.

Then,

Cl1 (R, S,|Ψi) + 1 = Cl1 (R, T,|Ψi) + 1 = 2 + √2;
Cl1(Q, S,|Ψi) + 1 = 4;
Cl1(Q, T,|Ψi) + 1 = 2.

Thus,

[Cl1(Q, S,|Ψi) + 1] + [Cl1(R, S,|Ψi) + 1]
+ [Cl1(R, T,|Ψi) + 1] − [Cl1(Q, T,|Ψi) + 1]
= 6 + 2√2 > 8.

In fact, the above inequality is true for any maximally entan-
gled state.

IV. BELL TYPE INEQUALITY IN RELATIVE ENTROPY

CASE

In full analogy to the l1 norm case, we can also establish

the bell inequality for relative entropy coherence.
Theorem 2. In two qubit system HA ⊗HB, if the global state
ρAB is product state ρA ⊗ ρB ∈ D (HA ⊗ HB), then for any
observables R, Q in HA and observables S, T in HB, we have:

Cr(Q, S, ρAB) + Cr(R, S, ρAB)

+ Cr(R, T, ρAB) − Cr(Q, T, ρAB) ≤ 4

(9)

Furthermore, if ρAB is the maximally entangled state in HA⊗
HB, then there exist observable R, Q in HA and S, T in HB,
such that

Cr(Q, S, ρAB) + Cr(R, S, ρAB)

+ Cr(R, T, ρAB) − Cr(Q, T, ρAB) > 4.

(10)

3

Cr(Q, S,|Ψi) = Cr(R, S,|Ψi) = Cr(R, T,|Ψi) = Cr(Q, T,|Ψi)

= H(

where H(~p) = Pi −pi log pi is the Shannon entropy, and

Cl1 (Q, S,|Ψi) + 1 = Cl1 (R, S,|Ψi) + 1
= Cl1 (R, T,|Ψi) + 1 = Cl1(Q, T,|Ψi) + 1
= 2 + √2.

Thus,

Cr(Q, S,|Ψi) + Cr(R, S,|Ψi) + Cr(R, T,|Ψi) − Cr(Q, T,|Ψi) = 3.2018
and

[Cl1(Q, S,|Ψi) + 1] + [Cl1(R, S,|Ψi) + 1]
+ [Cl1(R, T,|Ψi) + 1] − [Cl1(Q, T,|Ψi) + 1]
= 4 + 2√2 < 8.

Take ρAB = p I

4 + (1 − p)|ΨihΨ|, where |Ψi = 1√2

(|01i −

|10i). Then,

Cr(Q, S, ρAB) + Cr(R, S, ρAB) + Cr(R, T, ρAB) − Cr(Q, T, ρAB)

can take any value between [4, 4.2018].

It also true for l1 norm case.
Since ρAB are always able to be written in the local basis
of Q and T, we can take Q : { | 0i, | 1i} ; T : { | 0i, | 1i}
without loss of generality. Then,

|R−i (cid:21) = (cid:20) Ra Rb
(cid:20) |R+i

|1i (cid:21)
−R∗b R∗a (cid:21)(cid:20) |0i

(14)

(15)

Proof. When ρAB = ρA ⊗ ρB, it is easy to have the following
fact,

Cr(X, Y, ρA ⊗ ρB) = Cr(X, ρA) + Cr(Y, ρB).

Thus, we have:

Cr(Q, S, ρA ⊗ ρB) + Cr(R, S, ρA ⊗ ρB)
+Cr(R, T, ρA ⊗ ρB) − Cr(Q, T, ρA ⊗ ρB)

= 2[Cr(R, ρA) + Cr(S, ρB)] ≤ 4.

When ρAB is singlet state, i.e., |Ψi = 1√2

Take:

(|01i − |10i).

R : { | ψ+i, | ψ−i} ; S : { | +i, | −i} ;
Q : { | 0i, | 1i} ; T : { | 0i, | 1i} .

where |ψ+i = 1
β (|+i − |0i), α =
α (|+i + |0i),|ψ−i = 1
p2 + √2, β = p2 − √2. And |ψ+i ,|ψ−i are the eigen-
states of the observable (−Z − X)/√2.

Then,

Cr(R, S,|Ψi) = Cr(R, T,|Ψi)
1
4α2 ,

1
4α2 ,

= H(

1
4β2 ,

1
4β2 ) = 1.6009;

Cr(Q, S,|Ψi) = 2;
Cr(Q, T,|Ψi) = 1.
Therefore,

Cr(Q, S,|Ψi) + Cr(R, S,|Ψi)

+ Cr(R, T,|Ψi) − Cr(Q, T,|Ψi) = 4.2018 > 4.

In fact, the above inequality is true for any maximally entan-
gled state. Thus, we have the following theorem.

Based on above facts, we may consider the following prob-
lem: when Alice and Bob choose observable R,Q,S,T such
that Bell inequality obtain the maximal value, then these ob-
servable can violate the inequality in coherence theory?

However, this is not true. As we know, when we take

R,Q,S,T as following[9]:

R = X,S = (−Z − X)/√2;
Q = Z,T = (Z − X)/√2;

(11)
(12)

and

then the Bell inequality attach the maximal value. It is easy to
show the eigenstates of these observables:

R : { | +i, | −i} ; S : { | ψ+i, | ψ−i} ;
Q : { | 0i, | 1i} ; T : { | φ+i, | φ−i} .

α (|+i + |0i),|ψ−i = 1

where |ψ+i = 1
β (|+i − |0i),|φ+i =
β (|+i − |1i), α = p2 + √2, β =
α (|+i + |1i),|φ−i = 1
p2 − √2. And |ψ+i ,|ψ−i are the eigenstates of the observ-
able (−Z − X)/√2, |φ+i ,|φ−i are the eigenstates of the
observable (Z − X)/√2

Through simple calculation, we have:

|S−i (cid:21) = (cid:20) Sa Sb
(cid:20) |S+i

|1i (cid:21)
−S∗b S∗a (cid:21)(cid:20) |0i

We ﬁnd that 4.2018 and 6 + 2√2 is not the maximal value

attached in the state |Ψi = 1√2

(|01i − |10i). If we take
R : { | R+i, | R−i} ; S : { | S+i, | S−i} ;
Q : { | 0i, | 1i} ; T : { | 0i, | 1i} .

where

|R−i (cid:21) =
(cid:20) |R+i

1

√2 (cid:20) 1 i

|1i (cid:21)
i 1 (cid:21)(cid:20) |0i

and

then,

|S−i (cid:21) =
(cid:20) |S+i

1

√2 (cid:20) 1 1

|1i (cid:21)
−1 1 (cid:21)(cid:20) |0i

Cl1(R, S,|Ψi) + 1 = Cl1(R, T,|Ψi) + 1 = Cl1 (Q, S,|Ψi) + 1 = 4;
Cl1(Q, T,|Ψi) + 1 = 2,

and

Cr(R, S,|Ψi) = Cr(R, T,|Ψi) = Cr(Q, S,|Ψi) = 2;
Cr(Q, T,|Ψi) = 1.
Thus,

[Cl1(Q, S,|Ψi) + 1] + [Cl1(R, S,|Ψi) + 1]
+[Cl1(R, T,|Ψi) + 1] − [Cl1(Q, T,|Ψi) + 1] = 10.

and

Cr(Q, S,|Ψi) + Cr(R, S,|Ψi)
+Cr(R, T,|Ψi) − Cr(Q, T,|Ψi) = 5.

In fact, for any pure state can be written in following from:

|ψi = ψ0 |01i + ψ1 |10i or |φi = φ0 |00i + φ1 |11i

they can not violate the above bound.

In the work [30], we have the following fact: in the bipartite

system HA ⊗ HB,

min

UA⊗UB Cr(UA ⊗ UBρABU†A ⊗ U†B) = D(ρAB)

(16)

where D(ρ) is the quantum discord of ρ, which is deﬁned by
D(ρ) = minδ∈CC S(ρ||δ), where CC denotes the set of all
classical states.

However, we consider the converse problem:

max

(17)

Let HA = HB = (C2)⊗n. When ρAB = ρA ⊗ ρB, then

i.e., |Ψi = Pk

1√2n |ψki|φki, then

max

(18)

However, for general states, it still unknown the answer to

the problem (17).

V. CONCLUSION

In this work, we investigate the bell type inequality in quan-
tum coherence. First we demonstrate the bell type inequality
for l1 norm measure and the give an example which violate
this inequality. Then we give another bell inequality for rela-
tive entropy and show the similar results. However, we don’t
know whether these bell inequality holds for other states or
not. We wish the results obtained in this paper can shed lights
into some related problems in quantum information theory.
