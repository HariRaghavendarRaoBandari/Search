We review the status of bouncing cosmologies as alternatives to cosmological inﬂation for providing
a description of the very early universe, and a source for the cosmological perturbations which are
observed today. We focus on the motivation for considering bouncing cosmologies, the origin of
ﬂuctuations in these models, and the challenges which various implementations face.

I. MOTIVATION

The inﬂationary scenario [1] is the current paradigm of
early universe cosmology. Inﬂation solves several prob-
lems of Standard Big Bang cosmology, and it gives rise
to a causal theory of structure formation [2] (see also [3])
which made a number of predictions for cosmological ob-
servations which were subsequently successfully veriﬁed.
In spite of the phenomenological success, inﬂation faces
a number of conceptual challenges (see e.g. [4] for a re-
view of these problems) which motivate the exploration
of alternative early universe scenarios. Before mentioning
some of these challenges we must begin with a lightning
review of inﬂationary Universe cosmology.

According to the inﬂationary scenario, the universe
underwent a period of almost exponential expansion at
some very early time. As a consequence, the horizon ex-
panded exponentially and became larger than our past
light cone - both evaluated at the time of recombina-
tion - provided that the period of accelerated expansion
was suﬃciently long. During this period, spatial cur-
vature was also diluted. Any wavelength of ﬂuctuation
was stretched quasi-exponentially during the period of
inﬂation so that the wavelengths corresponding to scales
which are being observed today in cosmological exper-
iments were smaller than the Hubble radius H−1(t) at
the beginning of inﬂation, where H(t) is the expansion
rate of space. The space-time geometry of inﬂationary
cosmology is sketched in Fig. 1. In this ﬁgure, the verti-
cal axis is time t, with t = ti denoting the beginning of
the inﬂationary phase, and t = tR the end; the horizontal
axis represents physical spatial distance. The Hubble ra-
dius is almost constant between ti and tR, and increases
linearly before ti and after tR. The horizon is shown
as the dashed curve which equals the Hubble radius at
the beginning of the period of inﬂation but increases ex-
ponentially until tR. The curve labeled λ indicates the
physical wavelength of a cosmological ﬂuctuation mode.

Assuming that the perturbations begin as quantum
vacuum ﬂuctuations [2] deep inside the Hubble radius,
one can compute the amplitude of the resulting ﬂuc-
tuations today [2] (see [5, 6] for reviews of the theory
of cosmological perturbations). One ﬁnds that the in-
duced spectrum of ﬂuctuations is approximately scale-
invariant and that the observed amplitude of ﬂuctuations
is achieved if the Hubble expansion rate during the pe-
riod of inﬂation was of the order H ∼ 1013GeV, which
corresponds to an energy density during the inﬂationary
period which is of the order η ∼ 1016GeV, the scale of
particle physics “Grand Uniﬁcation”. With this value of
H, it turns out that the period of accelerated expansion
has to last for at least 50 e-foldings in order for inﬂation
to be able to solve the horizon and ﬂatness problems.

One key challenge for inﬂation is the singularity prob-
lem. If inﬂation is realized by the dynamics of scalar mat-
ter ﬁelds coupled to Einstein gravity, then the Hawking-
Penrose singularity theorems [7] can be extended [8] to
show that an inﬂationary universe is geodesically past in-
complete. Thus, there necessarily is a singularity before
the onset of inﬂation. Hence, the inﬂationary scenario
cannot yield the complete history of the very early uni-
verse. A bouncing cosmological scenario naturally avoids
this singularity problem, although at the cost of having
to introduce new physics to obtain the bounce1.

A second challenge which the inﬂationary scenario
faces is the trans-Planckian problem for ﬂuctuations. If
the period of accelerated expansion lasts only slightly
longer than the minimal amount of time which it has to
last in order to solve the problems of Standard Big Bang
cosmology, then the wavelengths of all scales of cosmo-
logical interest today originate at sub-Planckian values
at the beginning of inﬂation. Hence, the origin and early
evolution of cosmological ﬂuctuations took place in the

1 We shall not here consider those mixed models in which a con-
tracting phase followed by a bounce leads to an inﬂationary era.
Such models enjoy the beneﬁts of both paradigms, but also im-
ply a higher level of sophistication which, at the present time,
may not be required by the data; Occam’s razor demands they
should be introduced only at a later stage if needed.

trans-Planckian regime where General Relativity as the
description of space-time and quantum ﬁeld theory as the
description of matter break down. As demonstrated in
[9], modiﬁcations of the physics in the trans-Planckian
region may lead to important modiﬁcations of the pre-
dicted spectrum of cosmological perturbations. In Fig. 1,
we exhibit the trans-Planckian problem for cosmologi-
cal ﬂuctuations: the shaded region for small distances
represents the “trans-Planckian zone of ignorance”. The
curve labeled λ indicates the wavelength of a cosmolog-
ical ﬂuctuation mode, and shows that it emerges from
the zone of ignorance. Hence, in the absence of an em-
bedding of inﬂation into a consistent theory of quantum
gravity, we cannot trust the standard computations in
inﬂation without implicitly assuming features of physics
beyond the Planck scale. There has been a lot of debate
on how reasonable it is to make assumptions which leave
the standard computations unchanged (see e.g. [10]), or
suggestions of how to impose initial conditions on time-
like “new physics” hypersurfaces which exclude the trans-
Planckian zone of ignorance [11], leading to oscillatory
features in the predicted power spectra of ﬂuctuations.
For a recent review of this problem, the reader is refered
to [12].

Bouncing cosmologies naturally avoid this

trans-
Planckian problem since the length scale of ﬂuctuations
we observe remain many orders of magnitude larger than
the Planck length. To be speciﬁc, if the energy scale of
the bounce corresponds to the same energy scale as in
typical inﬂation models, then the wavelengths of scales
coresponding to observed cosmic microwave background
(CMB) anisotropies were always larger than 1 mm. This
is illustrated in the space-time sketch of Fig. 2. The ver-
tical axis is time, with t = 0 being the bounce time, the
time when the spatial volume is minimal. This is thus
also the time when the wavelengths of cosmological per-
turbations are minimal, and their values correspond to
those in inﬂationary cosmology at the end of the period
of inﬂation, i.e. at the time tR. The horizontal axis again
represents physical spatial distance. What is universal
in bounce alternatives to inﬂation is that the evolution
after the bounce is the same as that in standard and in-
ﬂationary cosmology after the time tR. Diﬀerent classes
of bouncing models predict diﬀerent contracting phases.
The example sketched in Fig. 2 with a contracting phase
which is the time reverse of the standard cosmology phase
of expansion corresponds to a symmetric bounce as in the
matter bounce scenario [13, 14].

As is evident from Fig. 2,

in bouncing cosmologies
scales of cosmological interest originate on sub-Hubble
scales at early times in the contracting phase, in the same
way that they originate on sub-Hubble scales early in the
accelerating phase in inﬂationary cosmology. Hence, it is
possible to have a causal generation mechanism for ﬂuc-
tuations, as in inﬂationary cosmology. The nature of
this structure formation mechanism depends on the spe-
ciﬁc bouncing model being considered. The origin of the
ﬂuctuations is often (e.g.
in the Pre-Big-Bang [15], the

FIG. 1: Space-time sketch of inﬂationary cosmology. The ver-
tical axis is time t, the period of accelerated expansion being
between ti and tR and the horizontal axis shows the relevant
physical distances. The horizon is represented by the dotted
curve and the Hubble radius by the full one. The physical
wavelength of a ﬂuctuation mode is labeled by λ, which is in-
versely proportional to the wave number k. The vertical line
shows the Planck length (cid:96)Pl, emphasizing the trans-Planckian
zone of ignorance corresponding to length scales smaller than
(cid:96)Pl. As is apparent, scales of cosmological interest today orig-
inate in the zone of ignorance.

Ekpyrotic [16] or matter bounce [13] scenarios) also taken
to be quantum vacuum perturbations, as in inﬂation, but
this is not always the case, string gas cosmology [17] be-
ing an example in which the initial ﬂuctuations are of
thermal nature [18].

A further conceptual problem of scalar ﬁeld-driven in-
ﬂation is the basic sensitivity of the mechanism of ob-
taining exponential expansion to the unknown solution
of the cosmological constant problem. The inﬂationary
expansion of space is generated by the almost constant
potential energy density of the matter scalar ﬁeld. How-
ever, quantum matter has a ﬁeld-independent vacuum
energy which is much larger than the upper bound on
the current value of the cosmological constant, given by
the observed dark energy density (see e.g.
[19]). There
must be some unknown mechanism which renders quan-
tum vacuum energy gravitationally inert. The challenge
for inﬂationary cosmology is to show that this mechanism
does not also render the part of a scalar ﬁeld potential
which has the equation of state of a cosmological constant
gravitationally inert (and thus eliminates the possibility
of scalar ﬁeld-mediated inﬂation). For an interesting at-

mordial spectrum of cosmological ﬂuctuations, but it is
not the only one. Therefore, even if one believes that in-
ﬂation is the correct paradigm for the early universe, and
that it gives the correct origin of cosmic structures, it is
important to work out alternative scenarios and to see
in which way these alternatives yield predictions (other
than those mentioned above) with which they can be dif-
ferentiated from inﬂation. For example, whereas simply
observing gravitational waves on cosmological scales from
B-mode polarization is not at all a unique prediction of
inﬂation (see e.g. [24] for an elaboration on this point),
measuring a slight red tilt would be a rather distinctive
prediction since it would allow us to rule out some al-
ternatives such as string gas cosmology which predicts a
slightly blue spectrum [25]. Working out distinctive pre-
dictions of alternative models will provide new tests for
inﬂation - tests which, if passed will put inﬂation on a
ﬁrmer footing, and if failed will allow us to falsify the
paradigm.

In the following, we will present three classes of bounc-
ing cosmologies, the matter bounce scenario [13], mod-
els of Pre-Big-Bang [15] or Ekpyrotic [16] type, and
string gas cosmology [17, 18].
In the next section we
will brieﬂy introduce these scenarios and explain how
to obtain a spectrum of cosmological perturbations in
agreement with current observations. New physics, i.e.
physics which goes beyond General Relativity and/or
standard matter theory (i.e. models of matter which obey
the Null Energy Condition) is required. In Section 3 we
discuss some realizations of cosmological bounces using
extensions of gravity and/or the matter sector. In Sec-
tion 4 we illustrate some speciﬁc observational signatures
of these bouncing cosmology scenarios, signatures with
which they can be diﬀerentiated from the predictions of
inﬂationary models. We conclude with a discussion of
some key challenges for bouncing cosmologies.

Note that the goal of this article is to be pedagogi-
cal rather than complete. We are not giving a complete
list of alternatives to inﬂation, nor are we discussing all
bouncing scenarios (for a more complete survey or older
models see [26], and [27] for a more recent review).

In the following we use the “mostly negative” conven-
tion for the metric [see Eq. (1)]. Greek letters denote
space-time indices whereas Latin ones stand for spatial
only indices.

II. ORIGIN OF SCALE-INVARIANCE OF

COSMOLOGICAL FLUCTUATIONS

A. Cosmological Perturbations

In this section we will introduce four bouncing scenar-
ios which have been widely discussed in the literature,
and we will show how to obtain a scale-invariant spec-
trum of cosmological ﬂuctuations at late times. We must
begin with a brief review of the basics of cosmological
perturbations. For more details the reader is referred to

FIG. 2: Space-time sketch of a speciﬁc bouncing cosmology.
The axes are as in Figure 1. The bounce point corresponds to
t = 0 at which point the Hubble radius H−1(t), also shown,
diverges (H → 0) with the wavelength λ = a(t)/k of a typical
mode depicted as well. The ﬁgure also shows clearly why
the trans-Planckian problem is not an issue in a bouncing
framework.

tack on this problem in the context of the “degravitation”
proposal [20] to address the cosmological constant prob-
lem, see [21].

Alternatives to cosmological inﬂation do not solve the
cosmological constant problem. However, the dynamics
of space-time expansion is then a priori not sensitive to
what solves the problem (except if a mechanism similar
to that used for the inﬂationary phase is invoked for the
bouncing phase).

There is a completely diﬀerent reason to be interested
in alternatives to inﬂation. The successful predictions
which inﬂation has made for the spectrum of cosmolog-
ical perturbations are not speciﬁc to inﬂation. In fact,
a decade before the development of inﬂationary cosmol-
ogy, it was realized by Sunyaev and Zel’dovich [22] and
by Peebles and Yu [23] that a roughly scale invariant
spectrum of adiabatic perturbations which at the time of
equal matter and radiation are present on super-Hubble
scales will lead to the Sachs-Wolfe scale-invariant large
angle tail and to acoustic oscillations on degree scales
in the angular power spectrum of the CMB, it will lead
to a power spectrum of primordial density ﬂuctuations
which is scale invariant and has superimposed small am-
plitude baryon acoustic oscillations, all features which
have now been observed. The inﬂationary scenario is the
ﬁrst model which from ﬁrst principles predicts such a pri-

The Friedman-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker

(FLRW)
metric of a homogeneous and isotropic background space-
time will be written as

ds2 = dt2 − a2(t)dx2 = a2(t)(cid:0)dη2 − dx2(cid:1) ,

where t is the cosmic time, η is conformal time, x are the
comoving spatial coordinates and a(t) is the scale factor,

with respect to t and η.
In most cosmological mod-
els (string gas cosmology being an exception), matter is
modelled in terms of a scalar ﬁeld ϕ with a non-trivial
background dynamics ϕ0(t).

Linear ﬂuctuations of geometry and matter about the
background can be classiﬁed according to how they trans-
form under spatial rotations. There are scalar modes,
vector modes and tensor modes (gravitational waves).
There are ten metric degrees of freedom plus the num-
ber of degrees of freedom in the matter sector (one if the
model contains only a single scalar ﬁeld like prototypical
models of inﬂation). Four of the metric degrees of free-
dom are scalar, four are vector, and the remaining two are
the two polarization modes of gravitational waves. There
are also four gauge modes which represent the invariance
under linearized space-time coordinate transformations.
Two of the gauge modes are scalar and two are vector. In
the following we will not consider vector modes since they
decay in the expanding phase (however, they do grow in
the contracting phase [29]).

We can choose a gauge in which the scalar metric ﬂuc-
tuations are diagonal. In this gauge, the metric including
linear ﬂuctuations takes the form

ds2 = a2(cid:8)(1 + 2Φ) dη2 − [(1 − 2Ψ) δij + hij] dxidxj(cid:9) ,

(3)
where Φ(x, t) and Ψ(x, t) denote the two scalar met-
ric ﬂuctuations, and the transverse traceless tensor hij
(which also depends on space and time) represents the
gravitational waves. At linear order, the equations for
scalar metric perturbations and gravitational waves de-
couple. We will ﬁrst consider the scalar modes.

If the gravitational action is the Einstein-Hilbert ac-
tion and if matter contains no anisotropic stress, then it
follows from the oﬀ-diagonal spatial Einstein equations
that the two scalar gravitational potentials Φ and Ψ co-
incide. The matter ﬁeld can also be linearized about its
background:

ϕ(x, t) = ϕ0(t) + δϕ(x, t).

(4)

The Einstein constraint equations relate the two scalar
ﬂuctuations Φ and δϕ. Physically this is easy to under-
stand: a matter perturbation has a gravitational eﬀect
on the metric and leads to a metric perturbation. As

4

a consequence of this contraint there is a single scalar
metric degree of freedom.

The equations of motion for cosmological ﬂuctuations
can be obtained by linearizing the full Einstein equations
about the background metric. More easily, the equations
can be obtained by expanding the action of matter plus
gravity to second order about the background action.
Since the background satisﬁes the equations of motion,
terms linear in cosmological ﬂuctuations cancel out in the
action, leaving the quadratic terms as the leading ﬂuctu-
ation terms. Working in terms of the action allows the
identiﬁcation of the variable v(x, t) in terms of which the
action has canonical kinetic terms [30, 31]. This variable
is

v = a(cid:16)δϕ +

It turns out that the canonical variable v has an impor-
tant physical meaning: it is proportional to the curvature
ﬂuctuation ζ in comoving gauge (gauge in which δϕ = 0):

ζ ≡

(7)

It is this variable which determines the late time curva-
ture ﬂuctuations. Hence, in every early universe model,
we need to be able to compute the power spectrum of ζ
which is deﬁned via

Pζ(k) = k3|ζ(k)|2 ,

(8)

with ζ(k) the Fourier transform of ζ 2. Conventionally,
one introduces a scalar index ns to describe the slope of
the spectrum, namely

P (k) ∼ kns−1.

(9)

The canonical variable v evolves like a scalar ﬁeld with
a time-dependent mass, the time dependence being set
by the dynamics of the cosmological background

(10)

where the ∇ operator corresponds to the gradient oper-
ator with respect to the comoving coordinates x. At the
linear level, we can expand v(x, t) into spatial Fourier
modes which all evolve independently. In Fourier space,
the equation of motion becomes

v(cid:48)(cid:48)

the Fourier modes have mass dimension −3/2 plus the mass di-
mension of the position space quantity.

5

Exponential expansion is not the only expansion his-
tory which is able to convert a vacuum spectrum into
a scale-invariant one. As we will see in the following
subsection, a matter-dominated contraction phase leads
to exactly the same preferential squeezing of long wave-
length modes, compared to short wavelength ones, and
which is able to convert a vacuum spectrum into a scale-
invariant one [32].

In the case of more than one matter ﬁeld there are
extra scalar degrees of freedom which are usually called
entropy modes. Entropy ﬂuctuations induce a growing
curvature mode. Let us consider the case when a scalar
ﬁeld ϕ dominates the background, and a second scalar
ﬁeld χ is the entropy mode with energy density ﬂuctu-
ation δρχ. In this case, the induced curvature mode is
given by the following equation (see e.g. [34, 35])

˙ζ = H(cid:0)c2

χ(cid:1)
ϕ − c2

δρχ

ρϕ + pϕ

,

(16)

where ρϕ and pϕ are energy density and pressure in the ϕ
ﬁeld, δρχ is the energy density ﬂuctuation of the χ ﬁeld,
and cϕ and cχ are the speeds of sound of the ϕ and χ
ﬂuids, respectively.

In cosmological models in which the adiabatic mode
(the ﬂuctuations in the dominant matter component) has
a blue spectrum (as in the Pre-Big-Bang and Ekpyrotic
scenarios), it is possible to obtain a scale-invariant spec-
trum of curvature ﬂuctuations at late times via the con-
version equation (16) if the entropy ﬂuctuations acquires
a scale-invariant spectrum.

To conclude this subsection let us turn to an analysis
of gravitational waves. The transverse traceless tensor
hij for the tensor modes [see Eq. (3)] can be expanded in
terms of the two polarization states

ij + h×(x, η)×
ij ,

(17)

hij(x, η) = h+(x, η)+
ij and ×

where +
ij are two ﬁxed polarization tensors, and
h+ and h× are the amplitude functions for these modes.
Each of these two modes evolves independently at linear
order.

Inserting the ansatz (17) for an individual polarization
state into the Einstein action, we ﬁnd that the variable in
terms of which the perturbed action has canonical kinetic
term is

where k labels the comoving wave vectors. For vacuum
initial conditions imposed at some time ti, the initial
value of vk is given by

vk(ti) =

1
√2k

.

(12)

Note that the corresponding power spectrum is blue, i.e.
there is more power on short wavelengths. The value of
the index ns = 1 corresponds to a scale-invariant spec-
trum, i.e. a power spectrum which is independent of scale
k.

If the equation of state (i.e. the ratio between pres-
sure and energy density) of the cosmological background
is constant in time, then z(η) ∼ a(η) and it then fol-
lows that z(cid:48)(cid:48)/z is equal (up to a constant of order 1) to
H2. Thus, from Eq.
(11) it follows that the “squeez-
ing term” z(cid:48)(cid:48)/z is negligible compared to the k2 term for
wavelengths smaller than the Hubble radius. This implies
that the variable v will undergo oscillations with con-
stant amplitude on sub-Hubble scales. On super-Hubble
scales it is the k2 term which is negligible compared to
the squeezing term. Hence, we conclude that as a length
scale crosses the Hubble radius (e.g. during the inﬂation-
ary phase), the ﬂuctuations will stop to oscillate (they
“freeze out”), and the amplitude will begin to increase
as a consequence of the squeezing term (the ﬂuctuations
are “squeezed”). The equation of motion for vk has two
fundamental solutions. In the case of an expanding back-
ground, the dominant solution on super-Hubble scales is
given by

vk(η) ∼ z(η) .

(13)

Let us ﬁrst apply this formalism and show that a pe-
riod of exponential expansion leads to a scale-invariant
spectrum of cosmological perturbations. The time tH (k)
when the mode with wavenumber k crosses the Hubble
radius is given by

a−1 [tH (k)] k = H .

(14)

Before tH (k), the amplitude of vk is constant, afterwards
it increases in proportion to z. Hence, the power spec-
trum of ζ at some late time t is given

Pζ(k, η) = k3z−2(η)|vk(η)|2

(18)

resulting in the following equation of motion for each
Fourier mode

where in the ﬁnal step we have used (12) and (14). The
k-dependence has cancelled out and we have a scale-
invariant power spectrum. Long wavelength modes are
squeezed more than short wavelength ones. It is this ef-
fect which leads to the conversion of an initial vacuum
spectrum into a scale-invariant one.

Comparing the equations of scalar and tensor modes,
we see that they are very similar except that the squeez-
ing function z(cid:48)(cid:48)/z is replaced by a(cid:48)(cid:48)/a in the case of gravi-
tational waves. Both gravitational waves and scalar ﬂuc-
tuations oscillate on sub-Hubble scales, both freeze out at

Hubble radius crossing (more precisely when k2 becomes
equal to the squeezing function), and both are squeezed
on super-Hubble scales. If the equation of state of mat-
ter is independent of time, then z ∝ a and the squeezing
functions are identical.

In this case, the resulting
spectrum of curvature ﬂuctuations after the bounce is
not scale-invariant. There is, however, a particular equa-
tion of state in a contracting phase [37] which allows one
to transform a thermal particle spectrum into a scale-
invariant one.

B. Matter Bounce Scenario

The “matter bounce” scenario [13] is based on the du-
ality [32] (see also [33]) between the evolution of the
canonical ﬂuctuation variables in an exponentially ex-
panding period and in a contracting phase with pressure
p = 0. In an expanding universe, the growing mode of vk
is the mode which is proportional to z(η) and the second
mode is decaying. In contrast, in a contracting universe
the role of the modes is exchanged: the mode propor-
tional to z is decaying, and it is the second mode which
is growing. In a matter dominated phase of contraction
we have a(η) ∼ η2, and the solution of the mode equation
(11) on super-Hubble scales is

vk(η) = c1η2 + c2η−1 ,

(20)

where the constants c1 and c2 are set by the initial condi-
tions. The second mode is the growing one. It is the fact
that the equation of state is that of cold matter (p = 0)

as we show below, leads to the conversion of a vacuum
spectrum to a scale-invariant one on super-Hubble scales.

which leads to the characteristic scaling vk ∼ η−1 which,
Given the scaling vk ∼ η−1, it is easy to show that an

initial vacuum spectrum on sub-Hubble scales early in
the contracting phase is converted into a scale-invariant
one. The calculation follows the one done in the previ-
ous subsection in the case of an exponentially expanding
background:

C. Pre-Big-Bang Scenario

The Pre-Big-Bang scenario [15] (see [38] for an in-
depth review) is an approach to superstring cosmology.
If superstring theory is indeed the correct theory which
uniﬁes all four forces of nature and provides a quantum
theory of gravity, then we should expect that stringy ef-
fects will be important in the very early universe. One
aspect of string theory is that the graviton is not the
only massless mode. In addition, there is a dilaton and
an antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld. It is usually assumed that
the dilaton is ﬁxed at late times, but in the very early
universe we should expect it to be dynamical.

Neglecting, for the moment, the antisymmetric tensor
ﬁeld, the massless sector of string theory to which the
graviton belongs is given by dilaton gravity. In the string
frame the action is

S = (cid:90) dd+1x√−ge−φ (R + gµν∂µφ∂νφ) ,

(23)

where R is the Ricci scalar of the string frame metric, g
is its determinant, φ is the string frame dilaton, and d is
the number of spatial dimensions.

A conformal transformation takes the action into the

isotropic space-time metric, this transformation takes the
form

(cid:39) k3z−2(η)(cid:20) ηH (k)

η

(cid:21)2

(21)

|vk(ti)|2 .

Since H ∼ η−1 and since Hubble radius crossing is given
by k2 = H2, we ﬁnd that

ηH (k) ∼ k−1 .

(22)

Inserting this result into (21) and making use of vacuum
initial conditions leads to a scale-invariant spectrum of
perturbations on super-Hubble scales, as in the case of
inﬂationary cosmology.

In the case of scalar ﬁeld-driven inﬂation, the spec-
trum of cosmological perturbations is not exactly scale-
invariant, but it has a slight red tilt. The same is true
in the matter bounce scenario:
if we add a component
to matter which corresponds to the current dark energy
(e.g. a small cosmological constant), then a slight red tilt
results [36].

Since in the matter bounce scenario the universe begins
large and cold, it is reasonable to consider vacuum ini-
tial ﬂuctuations. It is, however, also possible to consider

˜a = ae−φ/(d−1)

˜φ = φ(cid:114) 2

d − 1

,

(24)

where tilde quantities are in the Einstein frame. The
Einstein frame action is

2

˜gµν∂µ

˜φ∂ν

˜φ(cid:19) .

(25)

The dilaton gravity action has time reﬂection symme-
try, but it also has a scale factor duality symmetry which
is related to the T-duality symmetry of string theory dis-
cussed in more detail in the subsection on string gas cos-
mology. In the case of a homogeneous and isotropic met-
ric, this transformation is

a → a−1
¯φ → ¯φ ,

where ¯φ is the “invariant” dilaton deﬁned via

¯φ = φ − 2d lna .

(26)

(27)

If we minimally couple perfect ﬂuid matter to space-
time in the Einstein frame, then in the case of d = 3 and
an equation of state of radiation, we obtain the usual
expanding radiation-dominated solution

a(t) ∼ t1/2
φ(t) = const .

(28)

This is the post-big-bang expanding solution. If we ﬁrst
perform a time reﬂection transformation followed by a
duality transformation, we obtain a super-exponentially
expanding solution with

a(t) ∼ (−t)−1/2
φ(t) ∼ −3 ln(−t)

(29)

which has growing string coupling constant and corre-
sponds to matter with a stringy equation of state p =
− 1
3 ρ. This is the so-called “Pre-Big-Bang” branch. In
the Einstein frame, the Pre-Big-Bang solution is a con-
tracting one. In both the Einstein and string frames, it
is easy to verify that constant comoving scales exit the
Hubble radius in the Pre-Big-Bang phase, as they do in
the matter bounce scenario.

Note that both of the above solutions are singular at
t = 0. The idea of the Pre-Big-Bang scenario is that
new physics takes over near t = 0 and smoothly connects
the Pre-Big-Bang and post-big-bang branches.
In the
Einstein frame, this thus leads to a bouncing cosmology.
Also for other equations of state of matter we can ﬁnd
a Pre-Big-Bang branch of an expanding solution with
decreasing curvature. In the case of pure dilaton gravity,
the contracting branch is given by the Einstein frame
metric scaling as [38]

a(η) ∼ η1/2 ,

(30)

where η is approaching 0 from negative values. In this
case, the mode equation (11) for scalar cosmological ﬂuc-
tuations has super-Hubble solutions

and

vk(η) ∼ |η|1/2

vk(η) ∼ |η|1/2 ln(k|η|) .

(31)

(32)

The second solution is the dominant one as η → 0.
From (31) and (32), it is easy to see that in contrast
to the matter bounce case, ﬂuctuations are damped on
super-Hubble scales. Hence, an initial vacuum spectrum
is not tilted towards the red, but towards the blue. The
power spectrum is (up to logarithmic corrections)

Pk(v) ∼ k3|vk [ηH (k)]|2

η

ηH (k)

(33)

Assuming an initial vacuum spectrum, the second term

on the right hand side scales as k−1, but since ηH (k) ∼

7

k−1 the third term scales as k, and hence we get an ns = 4
spectrum

Pk(v) ∼ k3 .

(34)

The tensor modes acquire a spectrum with the same
slope.

In order to obtain a scale-invariant spectrum of ﬂuc-
tuations in the Pre-Big-Bang scenario, we need to either
dramatically deform the background or else invoke the
entropy mechanism given by (16). In the Pre-Big-Bang
setup, there is a natural candidate for the entropy ﬁeld
χ of (16): the axion related to the antisymmetric tensor
ﬁeld H appearing in the massless spectrum of string the-
ory. A careful analysis [39] shows that, in the presence
of dynamical extra dimension, it is possible to obtain a
scale-invariant spectrum of axion energy density ﬂuctua-
tions which, via (16), will seed a scale-invariant spectrum
of curvature ﬂuctuations.

D. Ekpyrotic Scenario

The Ekpyrotic scenario [16] is also motivated by super-
string theory, and more speciﬁcally by Horava-Witten
theory [40], a speciﬁc realization of M-theory in which
space-time is 11 dimensional. Six spatial dimensions are
compactiﬁed with a ﬁxed radius, but there is one other
spatial dimensions which is orbifolded, i.e.
it has the
structure S1/Z2. At the orbifold ﬁxed points there are
boundary branes, one of them being our space-time, the
other containing hidden sector ﬁelds which only couple
gravitationally to our world. This model was introduced
for reasons of superstring phenomenology, and the mass
scale of the orbifold direction must be of the order of the
scale of particle physics Grand Uniﬁcation.

The authors of [16] add a negative exponential poten-
tial which causes the two boundary branes to approach
each other. In the Einstein frame, the period when the
two branes are approaching each other is a contracting
phase. The time when the two branes collide corresponds
to a singular bounce from the point of view of the low
energy eﬀective ﬁeld theory.

The low energy eﬀective ﬁeld theory of the Ekpyrotic
scenario is given by Einstein gravity minimally coupled
to a scalar ﬁeld φ with a negative exponential potential

V (φ) = −|V0| exp(cid:18)(cid:114) 2

p

φ

mPl(cid:19)

(35)

with index p (cid:28) 1, where mPl is the Planck mass. The
ﬁeld φ is related to the separation of the branes via
φ ∼ ln r. The key feature of the Ekpyrotic scenario is that
the equation of state parameter w is much larger than 1
during the contracting phase. This is a consequence of
the potential being a negative exponential. This results
in the potential energy partially canceling the kinetic en-
ergy, whereas both kinetic and potential terms yield pos-
itive contributions to the pressure.

An equation of state w (cid:29) 1 corresponds to very slow

contraction since

phase, we need to match the perturbations at the bounce
by imposing the analog of the Israel matching conditions
[42] on a space-like surface [43, 44]. As discussed in de-
tail in [45, 46], the result depends very sensitively on
the choice of the matching surface. Choosing the match-
ing surface to be the constant time surface yields the
result that the spectrum of the canonical variable v is
unchanged across the bounce [47]. However, any other
matching surface will allow the contracting phase domi-
nant mode of the metric ﬂuctuation variable Φ [see (3)]
to seed the expanding phase dominant mode of Φ which
then seeds the dominant mode of v. This means that
this method, depending so heavily on the matching sur-
face and conditions, can yield any desired spectrum and
thus lacks predictability.

(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

The equation of motion for the variable

Hence, as w (cid:29) 1 we have α ∼ 0. Returning to the mode
equation (11) – and to the corresponding equation for
gravitational waves (19) –, we see that the spectrum of
v is not changed on super-Hubble scales. Thus, if we
start with vacuum initial conditions, then the spectrum
of both curvature ﬂuctuations and gravitational waves
remains a vacuum spectrum

(43)

Pk(v) ∼ k2 ,

(40)

i.e. a ns = 3 spectrum.

As realized in [41], a spectator scalar ﬁeld χ evolving
in a negative exponential potential acquires ﬂuctuations
with a scale-invariant spectrum. This can easily be seen
in the absence of gravity, where the equation of motion
for the linearized ﬂuctuation modes becomes

¨δχ +(cid:18)k2 −

2

t2(cid:19) δχ = 0 .

(41)

This is the same equation which the curvature ﬂuctua-
tions in inﬂationary cosmology obey (in conformal time),
and hence the same analysis which was done in the case of
inﬂationary ﬂuctuations shows that initial vacuum per-
turbations on sub-Hubble scales acquire a scale-invariant
spectrum on super-Hubble scales.

Thus, one way to obtain a scale-invariant spectrum
of curvature perturbations in the Ekpyrotic scenario is
to posit the existence of a second scalar ﬁeld χ which
evolves in a similar negative exponential potential as the
ﬁeld φ which generates the Ekpyrotic contraction. In or-
der for scale-invariant χ ﬁeld ﬂuctuations (as opposed to
χ density ﬂuctuations) to lead to a scale-invariant spec-
trum of curvature ﬂuctuations, a coupling between the
two ﬁelds φ and χ at the background level is required
(see e.g. [34]).

There is, however, another way to generate a scale-
invariant spectrum of curvature ﬂuctuations at late times
in the expanding phase. Note that, up to now, we have
been speaking about the curvature ﬂuctuations on super-
Hubble scales in the contracting phase. To connect these
ﬂuctuations to curvature ﬂuctuations in the expanding

For p (cid:28) 1 this equation implies that the spectrum of u
(and hence of Φ) in unchanged on super-Hubble scales.
Vacuum initial conditions for the canonical variable v
imply, via the constraint equations, that the initial spec-
trum of u is

uk(ti) ∼ k−3/2

(44)

which leads to a scale-invariant spectrum of u and Φ
ﬂuctuations on super-Hubble scales in the contracting
phase, as initially expected in [48]. Taking the higher-
dimensional background of Ekpyrotic cosmology into ac-
count, one can show that a mechanism to convey the
scale-invariance of the spectrum of Φ in the contracting
phase to that of v in the expanding phase naturally arises
[49] (see also [50–53] for other studies of how to obtain
a scale-invariant spectrum of ﬂuctuations in Ekpyrotic
cosmology).

A new variant of the Ekpyrotic scenario [54] was re-
cently proposed which combines features of the original
Ekpyrotic scenario with standard inﬂation. This model,
called the anamorphic universe, has as a new ingredient
a time dependence of masses (in this respect there are
similarities with the “varying speed of light” scenario of
[55, 56]). As a consequence, the model looks like stan-
dard inﬂation for cosmological ﬂuctuations, whereas mat-
ter feels an Ekpyrotic bounce.

E. String Gas Cosmology

String Gas Cosmology [17] is based on key fundamental
principles of superstring theory, speciﬁcally on degrees of
freedom and symmetries which are absent in an eﬀective

9

of string states is unchanged under the transformation

R →

(cid:96)2
s
R

,

(45)

where (cid:96)s is the string length scale. This symmetry is
obeyed by the perturbative string interactions and is gen-
erally taken to be a symmetry of non-perturbative string
theory (see [58] for a textbook review).

It is now obvious that if ln(R/(cid:96)s) increases from −∞
to +∞, the temperature-time curve will correspond to a
temperature bounce. As argued in [17], a physical way
to measure distance for R (cid:29) (cid:96)s is in terms of the posi-
tion operator dual to the light momentum modes, and for
R (cid:28) (cid:96)s it is in terms of the position operator dual to the
light winding modes. In terms of this physical position
operator, we have a bouncing cosmology as the math-
ematical variable ln(R/(cid:96)s) increases from −∞ to +∞.
Thus, string gas cosmology can be viewed as a bouncing
cosmology.

Let us consider democratic initial conditions with all
nine space dimensions small and wound by the wind-
ing modes of the equilibrium string gas at a temperature
close to the Hagedorn temperature. The winding modes
initially prevent any of the spatial dimensions to grow.
In order for space to expand, the winding modes must
be able to annihilate. This requires the intersection of
string world sheets. Since string worlds sheets - in the
absence of long range forces - have vanishing probability
to intersect in more than three spatial dimensions, only
three dimensions are able to “eﬀectively decompactify”
and become large [17]. This argument has been been con-
ﬁrmed by numerical simulations [59], although there are
important caveats [60, 61]. Thus, it appears completely
natural from the point of view of string theory that there
are only three large dimensions of space even in a theory
which is deﬁned in nine space dimensions.

The fact that string gas cosmology takes the role of
winding modes into account allows a simple stabilization
of size [62] and shape [63] moduli. Introducing gaugino
condensation also allows the stabilization of the dilaton
[64] without destabilizing the size and shape moduli. In
addition, gaugino condensation triggers high scale super-
symmetry breaking [65].

If the universe contains a large amount of entropy, then
the range of values of R for which the temperature is
close to the Hagedorn value is wide (see Fig. 3). Hence,
it is natural to suppose that the phase with temperature
close to the Hagedorn temperature will be a long one,
suﬃciently long to maintain thermal equilibrium over a
distance scale which is larger than the physical length
of the comoving scale which corresponds to our current
Hubble radius. The time evolution of the eﬀective cos-
mological scale factor is sketched in Fig. 4. In this ﬁgure,
the horizontal axis is time, with t = tR being the time
of the phase transition when many of the string winding
modes annihilate and the equation of state becomes that
of a radiation ﬂuid. The vertical axis represents the scale
factor.

FIG. 3: Temperature T of a gas of closed strings in a box
of radius R as a function of radius. The temperature never
exceeds the Hagedorn temperature TH. The extent of the
plateau of the T (R) curve depends on the total entropy of
the system - the larger the entropy the wider the plateau.

ﬁeld theory approach to early universe cosmology. At the
outset the assumption is made that all spatial sections
are ﬁnite. We will in fact assume that space is a nine-
dimensional torus.

The ﬁrst key input is the Hagedorn spectrum of string
states, which leads to a maximal temperature which a gas
of strings in thermal equilibrium can achieve, the “Hage-
dorn temperature” TH [57]. Closed strings in fact contain
three types of modes: momentum modes which label the
center of mass motion of strings, winding modes which la-
bel the number of times which the string winds space. Fi-
nally there are the oscillatory modes of the strings which
have a Hagedorn spectrum. In an eﬀective ﬁeld theory
description, one only keeps the momentum modes.

Let us now consider a box of strings in thermal equi-
librium and initially with large radius. Since the energy
of the momentum modes is quantized in units of 1/R,
where R is the radius of a toroidal section, the momentum
modes are light and most of the energy of the thermal
bath will be in these modes. As we decrease the radius R,
the momentum modes become heavier. In thermal equi-
librium, the energy will gradually ﬂow into the oscillatory
modes (whose energy is independent of R) and into the
winding modes whose energy is quantized in units of R
and hence become light as R decreases. The temperature
initially increases as R decreases, but then levels oﬀ as
the Hagedorn temperature TH is approached. Once R
becomes very small, the energy all ﬂows into the winding
modes and the temperature T (R) decreases again (see
Fig. 3).

Here we in fact encounter the second key aspect of
string theory, namely the T-duality symmetry of the
spectrum of string states which states that the spectrum

FIG. 4: Sketch of the evolution of the scale factor (vertical
axis) as a function of time (horizontal axis) in string gas cos-
mology. The time tR is the end of the Hagedorn phase and
the beginning of the radiation phase of expansion.

The corresponding space-time sketch is shown in
Fig. 5. Now the vertical axis is time, and the horizontal
axis indicates physical length. The initial phase t < tR is
quasi-static and hence the Hubble radius goes to inﬁnity.
The physical wavelength of ﬂuctuation modes is constant
in this early Hagedorn phase, and smaller than the Hub-
ble radius. Hence, a causal generation mechanism for
ﬂuctuations is possible. If the Hagedorn temperature is
of the order of the scale of particle physics Grand Uniﬁca-
tion, then the physical wavelength of ﬂuctuations which
are observed today is similar to the length these modes
would have at the bounce point in a matter bounce whose
energy scale is that of Grand Uniﬁcation, and also simi-
lar to the length they would have at the end of a period
of inﬂation. Hence, the wavelengths are many orders of
magnitude larger than the Planck length, and hence far
removed from the trans-Planckian zone of ignorance.

The string gas cosmology mechanism of structure for-
mation developed in [18] (see the reviews in [66]) is based
on the assumption that our four-dimensional space-time
begins in a quasi-static phase of thermal equilibrium. In
this setup, thermal ﬂuctuations will be much more im-
portant than vacuum perturbations. Hence, it is natural
to assume that ﬂuctuations originate as thermal ﬂuctua-
tions of a gas of strings.

The idea of the computation of cosmological ﬂuctua-
tions [18] and gravitational waves [25] in string gas cos-
mology is to ﬁrst compute matter correlation functions
on sub-Hubble scales in the Hagedorn phase, and to use

expectation value of |Φ(k)|2 in terms of the correlation
function of the energy density, and in the second step
we have made the transition to position space.
In the
above, the temperature T is the temperature at the time
when the scale being considered exits the Hubble radius.
Since the temperature is approximately constant in the
Hagedorn phase, the spectrum of cosmological pertur-
bations is approximately scale-invariant. Looking a bit
more closely, we see that smaller length scales exit the
Hubble radius slightly later, when the temperature is
slightly lower. Hence, the string gas cosmology struc-
ture formation scenario automatically generates a small
red tilt in the spectrum, like simple inﬂation models.

As realized in [25], the spectrum of gravitational waves
is also approximately scale-invariant. However, a small
blue tilt is predicted, whereas all inﬂation models based
on General Relativity and matter obeying the NEC pre-
dict a small red tilt. The gravitational wave spectrum is
given by [25]

III. REALIZATIONS OF A BOUNCING PHASE

11

A.

Introductory Remarks

According to the Hawking-Pensose theorems [7], an
initial cosmological singularity inevitably arises in a ho-
mogeneous and isotropic model if we work in the context
of General Relativity and if the matter which couples
minimally to gravity obeys the Null Energy Condition
(NEC). In order to obtain a bouncing cosmology there
are thus several routes. One can work in the context
of Einstein gravity but introduce matter which violates
the NEC [70]. There are several dangers in taking this
route. First, one must avoid instabilites such as ghost
[71] and gradient instabilities. Secondly, one faces the
challenge of embedding such a model in the framework
of an ultraviolet complete theory of matter and gravity
[72].

On the other hand, any quantum theory of gravity
leads to terms in the eﬀective gravitational action which
go beyond the Einstein-Hilbert term. Hence, it may be
more promising to attempt to realize bouncing cosmolo-
gies in the context of modiﬁed theories of gravity. This
is the topic of the third subsection.

Ultimately, however, it would best best if a bouncing
scenario could be the result of an ultraviolet complete
theory of all four forces of nature, such as superstring
theory. Attempts in this direction will be brieﬂy reviewed
in the ﬁnal subsection.

Another way to classify bouncing models is whether
they are singular from the point of view of an eﬀective
ﬁeld theory (such as the Pre-Big-Bang or initial Ekpy-
rotic scenarios) or non-singular. We will give examples
of both.

B. Bouncing Cosmologies from Modiﬁed Matter

Note that if the string scale is taken to be the pre-
ferred one from heterotic string phenomenology (see [69]
for a textbook treatment), then the amplitude of the re-
sulting cosmological perturbations has the right order of
magnitude to match observations.

The three key inputs required in order to obtain a
scale-invariant spectrum of cosmological perturbations
from an early thermal phase are 1) a holographic scaling
of the heat capacity, 2) a quasi-static early phase end-
ing with a phase transition to the usual radiation phase
of expansion, and 3) the applicability of the perturbed
Einstein equations for infrared ﬂuctuation modes.

The simplest way to obtain a nonsingular bouncing
model with modiﬁed matter is to introduce a ﬁeld with
opposite sign kinetic energy term, i.e. a “ghost” ﬁeld, and
to arrange that during the contraction phase the absolute
value of the ghost ﬁeld energy density grows relative to
that of regular matter. This is the quintom cosmology
scenario [73]. For example, the regular matter can be
described by a perfect ﬂuid [70] or by a massive scalar φ
ﬁeld whose time-averaged energy density scales as a−3,
and ghost matter by a free scalar ﬁeld ψ with opposite
sign kinetic term whose energy density is dominated by
the ˙ψ2 term and whose energy density hence scales as

a−6 [74]3. The action is

with potential

(53)

The non-singular bounce takes place when the energy
densities of φ and ψ become equal.

A speciﬁc realization of the quintom cosmology sce-
nario can be obtained in the Lee-Wick model [76], a model
in which the quadratic divergences in loop amplitudes
are canceled by adding a ghost ﬁeld. Bouncing cosmolo-
gies can easily be obtained making use of the Lee-Wick
construction [77]. However, the ghost problem does not
appear to be solved. The ghost problem is absent, how-
ever, in the conformal cosmology of [78], a model in which
the scalar sector consists of two ﬁelds with an indeﬁnite
metric on the space of kinetic terms, but in which the
ghost is absent because the ghost degree of freedom can
be eliminated by a gauge choice. At the homogeneous
and isotropic level, the models of [78] have bouncing cos-
mological solutions.

At the classical level, the background equations of mo-
tion can be studied and show the existence of a smooth
bounce. Cosmological ﬂuctuations can also be evolved
explicitly through the bounce phase, with the result that
on large scales (wavelength larger than the duration of
the bounce phase) the spectrum of ﬂuctuations before
and after the bounce has the same spectral index. In par-
ticular, a scale-invariant spectrum of cosmological ﬂluc-
tuations set up during the matter phase of contraction
retains its scale-invariant shape after the bounce [74].

On the other hand, at the quantum level quintom mod-
els suﬀer from a ghost instability [71] - the vacuum can
decay into pairs of regular and ghost particles.

An improved nonsingular bounce can be obtained by
the “ghost condensate” mechanism [79] (see also [80]).
Ghost condensation is the kinetic sector analog of the
Higgs mechanism in the potential sector.
In the case
of the Higgs ﬁeld φ, the theory has a tachyon when ex-
panded about φ = 0, but not when expanded around the
true minimum of the potential. In the ghost condensate
scenario, we introduce a non-trivial kinetic term K(X)
in the action

S = (cid:90) [K(X) − V (φ)]√−g d4x ,

where X is the kinetic term

X = ∂µφ∂µφ ,

(54)

(55)

3 It should be noted that in [75], a regular scalar ﬁeld was used in
conjunction with positive spatial curvature to avoid the primor-
dial singularity through a bounce: a special state was assumed,
with very large occupation number, that was leading to a direct
violation of the NEC.

12

and we choose the kinetic function K(X) such that the
Lagrangian is ghost-like when expanded about X = 0,
but has the regular sign when expanded about the true
minimum of K(X). Thus, in the ghost condensate phase
there is no perturbative ghost instability.

Applied to bouncing cosmology, we can take [81]

K(X) =

,

(56)

1

8(cid:0)X − c2(cid:1)2

where c is some positive constant. We consider a poten-
tial V (φ) which decays exponentially as φ → ±∞ and
is positive at φ = 0. As initial conditions we consider a
contracting universe with φ = ct as t → −∞, i.e. with
the ﬁeld in the ghost condensate state. As t approaches
zero, the potential starts becoming important and slows
down the ﬁeld, thus leading the ghost ﬁeld to obtain neg-
ative kinetic energy. The bounce point is reached when
the ghost kinetic energy cancels the potential energy.

At a classical level, the dynamics is well behaved. One
can show that, like in the case of the quintom bounce,
on large scale a scale-invariant spectrum of cosmological
ﬂuctuations passes through the bounce without a change
in the spectral index. At a perturbative quantum level
the model is also safe, but there is the worry [72] that it
is not possible to embed a ghost condensate Lagrangian
into an ultraviolet complete theory of physics.

An additional problem is a gradient instability from
which the model suﬀers. This problem can be cured by
replacing the ghost condensate Lagrangian by a Galileon
Lagrangian [82] and considering Galileon bounces [83].

There are also other avenues of obtaining a bounc-
ing cosmology from modiﬁed matter which have been
explored. For example, the possibility of obtaining a
bounce from a Fermion condensate in the presence of
a non-trivial coupling of General Relativity to fermionic
ﬁelds has been explored in [84]. Another idea is to use
coupled scalar tachyons [85]. In a very diﬀerent spirit,
it has been realized that the instability of the Standard
Model Higgs ﬁeld can be used [86] to generate a phase
of Ekpyrotic contraction (but one needs an additional
ingredient to obtain the actual bounce).

C. Bouncing Cosmologies from Modiﬁed Gravity

In any approach to quantum gravity, terms in the
gravitational action which are additional to the usual
Einstein-Hilbert term are predicted. These terms may
be higher derivative in the eﬀective gravitational action
[87], and they may be non-local [88]. Assuming that the
matter theory is a standard one given in terms of an
energy-momentum tensor Tµν, then the eﬀective equa-
tions of motion including leading quantum correction
may be written as

Dµν(gαβ) = 8πGN Tµν ,

(57)

where Dµν is an operator which contains the Einstein
tensor Gαβ as leading term, but in addition the quantum

13

gravitational higher derivative and/or non-local terms.
We can extract the leading term and write

the spectral index of the cosmological ﬂuctuations is un-
changed across the bounce [93].

Dµν(gαβ) = Gµν + ˜Dµν(gαβ) .

Equivalently, we can write (57) as

Gµν = 8πGN T eﬀ
µν

with

T eﬀ
µν = Tµν −

1

8πGN

˜Dµν(gαβ) .

(58)

(59)

(60)

Bouncing cosmologies have also been studied in the
context of F (R) theories of gravity (see e.g.
[97]), in
models in which the gravitational action is supplemented
by a Gauss-Bonnet term (see e.g. [98]) and in F (T ) the-
ories of gravity (see e.g. [99]). Bouncing cosmologies can
also be obtained in models in which our space-time is a
brane moving through a higher-dimensional space-time
which is curved (e.g. of black hole type) [100]. Bounc-
ing cosmologies are also an inevitable consequence of the
“limited curvature gravitational action” of [101].

It is now easy to see that even with a matter energy-
momentum tensor which obeys the NEC, it is possi-
ble to obtain a bounce if the gravitational contribution

˜Dµν(gαβ) is such that the eﬀective energy-momentum

tensor violates the NEC.

One example where the idea can be realized is Horava-
Lifshitz gravity [89], an approach to quantum gravity
which gives up general space-time diﬀeomorphism invari-
ance and maintains only spatial diﬀeomorphism invari-
ance plus a new space-time anisotropic scaling symmetry

t → (cid:96)3t

and

xi → (cid:96)xi ,

(61)

where (cid:96) ∈ R is a scaling parameter. One can determine

the most general gravitational action which is consistent
with the above symmetries and which is power-counting
renormalizable. The resulting gravitational ﬁeld equa-

tions contain a new gravitational contribution ˜Dµν(gαβ)

which, when taken to the right hand side of the gravi-
tational ﬁeld equations, has the form of dark radiation
with negative eﬀective energy density whose energy den-
sity scales as a−4 in a contracting FLRW universe. The
coeﬃcient of the dark radiation depends on spatial cur-
vature. We only obtain dark radiation for positively or
negatively curved spaces, but not in the spatially ﬂat
case. Provided that regular matter scales in time less
fast than a−4, e.g. if it has a matter-dominated equation
of state, then eventually, the contribution of dark radi-
ation will become equal in magnitude to that of regular
matter, and a cosmological bounce will occur [90] (see
also [91]).

The main worry about extensions of General Relativ-
ity is the issue of stability of metrics we know should be
stable such as the FLRW or the Schwarzschild metrics.
For cosmological backgrounds, we have to worry about
ghost-like or tachyonic instabilities of the linearized per-
turbations. This issue was ﬁrst studied in [92], and then
in the context of a bouncing cosmology in [93]. There are
several versions of Horava-Lifshitz gravity. One of them
is called the “projectable version”, another is the original
version [89] extended by terms which were only implicit in
the original version - the “healthy extension” [94]. It was
found that in the healthy extension of Horava-Lifshitz
gravity, there are no disastrous instabilities at linear or-
der [95], but in the projectable version there are [96].
In the healthy version, it can moreover be veriﬁed that

D. Bouncing Cosmologies from String Theory

String theory is a candidate ultraviolet complete the-
ory which uniﬁes all four forces of nature at a quantum
level. As already seen in the subsection on string gas
cosmology, it should be expected that string theory will
lead to a very diﬀerent evolution of the early universe
than what is obtained in the eﬀective point particle the-
ory limit. At the present time, however, string gas cos-
mology is based on ideas from perturbative string the-
ory coupled with thermodynamic arguments. A rigorous
non-perturbative treatment is lacking. Hence, it is useful
to explore other approaches to string cosmology which
are more closely related to non-perturbative physics, and
which result in bouncing cosmologies. String gas cosmol-
ogy is one example, but in this subsection we will focus
on a couple of attempts which can be formulated in terms
of an eﬀective background ﬁeld theory.

One such approach is the S-brane bounce [102], which
is based on a certain class of Type II superstring back-
grounds [103] for which the string partition function has
a temperature duality

T →

T 2
c
T

(62)

where Tc is a critical temperature whose value is related
to the string scale.

We begin the evolution in a contracting universe start-
ing with a very large value of the temperature T (cid:29) Tc
(which physically corresponds to a very small value of
the eﬀective temperature). As the universe contracts,
T decreases (which means that the eﬀective tempera-
ture increases). Once the eﬀective temperature exceeds
the supersymmetry breaking scale, we can describe the
background cosmology using dilaton gravity. When the
temperature reaches the value T = Tc, a tower of string
states which for T (cid:54)= Tc are massive (of the string scale)
become massless and have to be included in the low en-
ergy eﬀective action. Hence, the eﬀective action for the
low mass modes of matter contains a term localized on
the spatial hypersurface T = Tc. This object is the space-
like analog of a D-brane in string theory, or of the zero
width limit of a topological defect in ﬁeld theory. Hence,

we call this term an S-brane (see also [104] for another
approach to S-branes in string theory).

The equation of state of an S-brane has vanishing en-
ergy density ρ = 0 and negative pressure p < 0 and hence
yields a term which violates the NEC, thus allowing for
a bouncing solution. As T approaches the value T = Tc
from above, the universe is contracting, but after the
S-brane is encountered as T = Tc the universe starts to
re-expand, with decreasing T , as shown explictly in [102].
The evolution of cosmological perturbations in this back-
ground was studied in [105] where it was shown that a
scale-invariant spectrum of curvature ﬂuctuations passes
through the bounce unchanged.

The second approach which we will mention here is
based on the AdS-CFT correspondence [106], a conjec-
ture which relates string theory on an AdS (anti-de-
Sitter) space-time to a conformal ﬁeld theory (CFT)
living on its boundary. This proposal can give a non-
perturbative deﬁnition of string theory on AdS since
we have a non-perturbative description of the boundary
CFT.

To apply the AdS/CFT correspondence to a bouncing
cosmology, we consider a time-dependent deformation of
AdS which asymptotically for t → ±∞ looks like pure
AdS but has growing bulk curvature as t → ±0. Mapped
onto the CFT living on the boundary, we obtain a time-
dependent gauge coupling constant which tends to zero
as t → ±0. This leads to the hope that the boundary ﬁeld
theory time evolution can be smoothly continued through
t = 0, and that this continuation can then be used to
construct a bulk space-time in the future of t = 0 [107]
(see also [108] for earlier work). We would thus be able
to pass through the bulk gravitational singularity (the
singular cosmological bounce point) in a unique way by
mapping the physics onto a well-deﬁned boundary theory.
Whereas this procedure works at the level of the
background cosmology, singularities on the gauge theory
side arise when cosmological ﬂuctuations are introduced.
This has recently been studied [109] in the case of a de-
formation of AdS obtained by a time-dependent dilaton
[110] (see also [111]). The singularity in the boundary
theory takes the form of a branch cut in one of the ﬂuc-
tuation modes, and in divergent total particle production
[109]. Hence, we need to impose time cutoﬀs at t = ±ξ,
where ξ is set, e.g., by the bulk curvature obtaining the
Planck value.
In this case, the cosmological perturba-
tions can be evolved on the boundary in a more unique
way than they could in the bulk, where the ambiguity of
the space-like matching surface is a major problem.

Concretely, the application of the AdS/CFT corre-
spondence to cosmological ﬂuctuations is now the follow-
ing. We begin with bulk ﬂuctuations in the contracting
branch of the deformed AdS. When the bulk curvature
becomes strongly coupled at the time denoted by −tc, we
project the ﬂiuctuations onto the boundary gauge theory.
We then evolve the boundary ﬂuctuations through t = 0
until the time +tc when the bulk becomes weakly coupled
again. At that time we reconstruct the bulk ﬂuctuations.

14

The analysis of [109] shows that on large scales, the
spectrum of bulk ﬂuctuations has the same slope at t =
−tc and t = tc. The amplitude, however, grows by a
factor which diverges as ξ approaches zero.
String gas cosmology is a scenario based on funda-
mental principles of superstring theory which can yield a
bouncing cosmology, as discussed earlier. The Ekpyrotic
scenario is, as well, originally motived by ideas from su-
perstring theory. For another recent construction of a
bouncing cosmology from string theory see [112].

It is also possible that bouncing cosmologies can arise
from alternative approaches to quantum gravity. Loop
quantum gravity is the prime example. In fact, in loop
quantum cosmology it can be shown that the cosmologi-
cal singularity can be avoided at the quantum level, and
that bouncing cosmologies are possible [113]. For a spe-
ciﬁc construction of a “matter bounce” in the context of
loop quantum cosmology see [114].

IV. OBSERVATIONAL SIGNATURES

Alternative models of early universe cosmology must
be able to explain all of the existing data and must be
consistent with the current constraints.
It is also very
important that they make new predictions with which
they can be diﬀerentiated from the current and widely
accepted inﬂationary paradigm. Given the wealth of data
which is expected in the near future from new telescopes
this is an ideal time to consider such predictions. They
could concern new observational windows such as CMB
B-mode polarization maps, 21cm redshift surveys and
gravitational wave astronomy, or vastly improved data
from radio and optical telescopes. Below we mention a
couple of examples of how new observational windows
will allow us to diﬀerentiate the predictions of various
bouncing cosmological models with those of the inﬂation-
ary scenario. We will discuss higher order eﬀects such as
non-Gaussianities, the tensor spectrum and its relations
with the observed scalar component, and the running of
the scalar spectrum (see also[115] for a discussion of ten-
sor non-Gaussianities in the matter bounce).

A. Non-Gaussianities

Bouncing models contain many interaction terms en-
suring that the bounce (and the previous phases) take
place. These, in turn, lead to an extra contribution to
the 3-point function which is given by the commutator

(cid:104)ζ(k1)ζ(k2)ζ(k3)(cid:105) = i(cid:90) t

tG(cid:104)[ζ(k1)ζ(k2)ζ(k3),Lint(t(cid:48))](cid:105)dt(cid:48),
(63)
where Lint contains the relevant interaction terms, and
the curvature perturbations ζ(ki) are evaluated at time
t; tG is an initial time at which no non-Gaussianity is

yet present 4. The interaction Lagrangian Lint needs be
calculated at least to third order in the perturbation ζ,
leading to a complicated function of ζ whose details can
be found in [116] where it was ﬁrst calculated.

One then usually expresses the three-point function as

(cid:104)ζ(k1)ζ(k2)ζ(k3)(cid:105) = (2π)7 δ(3) (k) P 2
ζ(cid:89)i

(64)

where k =(cid:80)i ki and A is a shape function, depending

ζ
is not the actual curvature perturbation spectrum but
rather represents a sum of permutations of the 3 diﬀerent
wavenumbers involved, namely
P 2
ζ = Pζ (k1)Pζ (k2) + Pζ (k2)Pζ (k3) + Pζ (k1)Pζ (k3) .
(65)
In general, one restricts attention to the so-called non
linearity parameter fNL, deﬁned in real space by

ζ = ζgauss (x) +

3

gauss (x) ,

(66)

where ζgauss (x) stands for the linear, Gaussian part of
the curvature perturbation. One then arrives at

(67)

Common conﬁgurations include the local shape (k3 (cid:28)
k1, k2), the equilateral shape (k1 = k2 = k3), or the
folded or orthogonal shapes [117–119]. Current bounds
set by PLANCK, including temperature and polarization
data, are [120],

f local
NL =0.8 ± 5,
f equil
NL = − 4 ± 43,
f ortho
NL = − 26 ± 21,

(68)

(68% CL) which are consistent with a Gaussian (all non-
linearity parameters vanish) spectrum. Such suppressed
non-Gaussianities are consistent with the prediction in
canonical, single ﬁeld, slow-roll models of inﬂation [116,
121].

Bouncing cosmologies present many diﬃculties for the
calculation of these non-Gaussianities, as in particular
many models induce large contributions. In an inﬂation-
ary setup, perturbations, and therefore non-Gaussianities
too, are produced at one instant of time, at Hubble
crossing, and then subsequently propagated mostly un-
changed. Many terms in the interaction Lagrangian Lint,
e.g., those depending on time derivatives of ζk, are utterly
negligible, leading to a ﬁnal result which never grows very

4 In this subsection we use the convention that the mass dimension

of ζ(k) is −3 and not −3/2 as we did earlier in this review.

15

large, and is in fact largely controlled by the slow-roll
parameter .
In a bouncing model however, although
the ﬁrst mechanism is rather similar, the subsequent
evolution can be very diﬀerent for two reasons. First,
the initial phase is one of contraction, during which the
modes may change with time, producing a more impor-
tant growth to begin with. This implies that the re-
sulting contraction non-Gaussianities can be much larger
than their inﬂationary counterpart. This stems from the
fact that the “slow-roll” parameter, in a contracting uni-
verse, is not a small parameter. In the case of the matter
bounce, it was found [122] that f local
8 , comparable
to the current bounds, and similarly the other fNL are
expected to be negative with a magnitude of a few.

NL = − 35

The second diﬀerence between an inﬂation phase and
a bouncing model is the existence of the bounce itself,
which has a tendency to increase any pre-existing non-
Gaussianity. For instance, in a simple model consisting of
a single scalar ﬁeld with positive spatial curvature [123],
it was realized that the closer the bounce to de Sitter,
the higher the production of non-Gaussianities, and at
a level which is such as to raise doubts on the validity
of the perturbative treatment of the bounce. Of course,
one may then argue that the problem stems from the
fact that the positive spatial curvature is crucial for the
bounce to merely take place, and that therefore this is not
necessarily a valid generic result. Granted, but more re-
cently, it was also shown [124], using a ghost-condensate
galileon model to perform the bounce in a ﬂat spatial
background, that fNL should also grow during the bounce
phase. Besides, it was also shown that the increase of the
level non-Gaussianity is directly related with that of the
overall amplitude of curvature perturbation, leaving the
tensor mode unchanged. As a result, the tensor to scalar
ratio, discussed in the following section, can remain small
and compatible with the current constraints at the ex-
pense having too much non-Gaussianities. This is even a
possibly fatal blow for single ﬁeld matter bounce models
[124].

The non-Gaussianities in string gas cosmology, on the
other hand, are predicted to be negligible on cosmolog-
ical scales [125]. The reason is the following: thermal
ﬂuctuations have a speciﬁc correlation length which is
microscopic and at which scale the non-Gaussianities are
thermal and or order one. However, on larger scales the
non-Gaussianities are Poisson suppressed and hence be-
come negligible on scales relevant for cosmological obser-
vations. There is a caveat to this argument: if the strings
in string gas cosmology are long-lived (see e.g. [126] for a
discussion of this point), then a network of cosmic super-
strings [127] is predicted to survive to the present time.
These strings would approach a scaling solution of the
same form as that describing cosmic strings forming in a
ﬁeld theory phase transition. These cosmic strings would
leave behind distinctive stringy signals in observations,
signals with speciﬁc patterns in position space (see [128]
for a recent review of these signals).

B. Running of the Scalar Spectrum

In simple single ﬁeld inﬂationary models, the red tilt
of the scalar spectrum is due to the fact that the Hubble
expansion rate H is very slowly decreasing during the
period of inﬂation.
In fact, the rate of decrease of H
is accelerating during the slow rolling phase. This leads
to the fact that the slope of the spectrum is increasing
in magnitude towards smaller wavelength. This implies
that the running of the spectrum is negative, i.e.
the
slope of the spectrum is smaller at larger values of the
momentum.

In the matter bounce scenario, on the other hand,
the tilt of the spectrum of cosmological perturbations is
caused by the fact that the contribution of the dark en-
ergy component is decreasing as a function of time during
the contracting phase. This implies that at large values
of k, the spectrum converges to a scale-invariant one, and
that thus the running of the scalar spectrum is positive.
This point was recently worked out in detail in [129].

Thus, a measurement of the running of the scalar spec-
trum would allow us to diﬀerentiate the canonical sin-
gle ﬁeld inﬂation models from the matter bounce sce-
nario. An analysis of the running of the scalar spectrum
in string gas cosmology is not available at this time.

C. Tensor to Scalar Ratio

The tensor to scalar ratio r is deﬁned by

r ≡ PT
PS

,

(69)

where PT and PS are the power spectra of the tensor
and scalar modes, respectively.
In the matter bounce
scenario, both the tensor and the scalar ﬂuctuations have
a scale-invariant spectrum, and the tensor to scalar ratio
before the bounce phase is predicted to be of order one
since the scalar and tensor modes obey the same equation
of motion. During the bounce, it is possible that the
scalar modes are enhanced relative to the tensor modes.
This issue has recently been studied in [124] in the case of
a particular two ﬁeld scenario. Nevertheless, generically
a large value of r is predicted. Hence, the value of r
does not provide a good window to diﬀerentiate between
inﬂation and the matter bounce.

In string gas cosmology, the value of r is given by the
ratio between the energy density and the pressure ﬂuc-
tuations, as discussed in the section on string gas cos-
mology. In the model of [17, 18] there is a consistency
relation which relates r to 1 − ns. Given the observed
value of ns, a value of r below the current observational
bounds is predicted (see [130] for a detailed discussion).
A measurement of r alone is hence also not a good way to
diﬀerentiate between string gas cosmology and inﬂation.
The situation is completely diﬀerent in the case of the
Ekpyrotic scenario. In this case, both the adiabatic scalar
spectrum and the tensor spectrum retain their original

16

vacuum slope, which means that the ﬂuctuations are neg-
ligible on cosmological scales. The scalar ﬂuctuations
which are currently observed must hence be due to a
non-standard mechanism such as entropy ﬂuctuations,
while there is no possibility of an additional generation
mechanism for tensor modes. The quantitative analysis
begins by considering the scale factor to decrease follow-
ing Eqs. (37) and (38), so the mode equation (11) gives

µ =

1

2(cid:112)−π(η − η∗)H (1)

1

2−β [−k(η − η∗)]

(70)

where H (1) is the Hankel function, and β (cid:28) 1; η∗ is
the time at which the ekpyrotic potential would reach
negative inﬁnity if it were described at all times by the
exponential shape leading to ekpyrotic contraction. The
tensor spectrum

PT =

k3
π2|h|2

(71)

must then be transfered through the kinetic driven phase,
the bounce, and the subsequent expanding phases by
means of either matching conditions or numerical evalu-
ation. A value for the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r ∼ 0.1
implies that, today, the gravitational power spectrum
should be of order PT (r ∼ 0.1) (cid:39) 10−10 on CMB

scales. The most stringent constraint on tensor modes
then comes from big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), during
which it has to be negligible. This implies contraints on
the amplitude at high frequencies, i.e. small wavelengths.
But the power spectrum being very blue, this also implies
that on the much longer wavelengths concerned by the
CMB, the tensor contribution should be even smaller. In
fact, according to this line of thoughts, any sizeable mea-
surement of r would immediately rule out the Ekpyrotic
scenario unless some yet-unknown mechanism is invoked.
The actual calculation was done in Ref. [131], from which
we reproduce the result in Fig. 6

The value of r is however very highly model depen-
dent in bouncing cosmologies (just as it is very discrim-
inatory in inﬂation model-building [132]), as illustrated
by a simple eﬀective bounce model with two ﬁelds: con-
sidering two scalar ﬁelds φ and ψ, the latter evolving in
an exponential potential reminiscent of the Ekpyrotic sit-
uation (but positive) and the former having a negative
deﬁnite kinetic energy only, i.e. (52) with the potential
(53) replaced by V = V0 exp (−λφ/mPl), the authors of
Ref. [133] showed that during the collapse phase, one
ﬁnds r = 8λ2. Since this is the only available free pa-
rameter, it also ﬁxes the scalar spectral index. In order
to recover a scale-invariant spectrum, one needs to set
λ = √3, leading to r = 24, much in excess of the current
observational constraint.

In a matter bounce scenario with a phase of Ekpyrotic
contraction used only to wash any primordial anisotropy,
the curvature ﬂuctuations can grow relatively large, with-
out spoiling the perturbative nature of the bounce, while
the tensor modes remain small at all times.
In such a

ratio r. It takes the form [136]

nt = −

r
8

.

17

(72)

Whereas the sign of nt is a very generic prediction of
scalar ﬁeld inﬂation, the speciﬁc relation between nt and
r is not generic since by complicating the matter sector
one can change the scalar ﬂuctuations.

In the case of the simple matter bounce model, one

obtains the consistency relation

nt = (ns − 1) ,

(73)

the reason being that both sets of ﬂuctuations start out
as vacuum perturbations, and that the squeezing of the
scalar and tensor modes is the same. The same applies
for the ekpyrotic contraction, with nt = 3 [see Eq. (40)].
On the other hand, in string gas cosmology the origin
of ﬂuctuations is thermal as opposed to quantum, and the
initial amplitudes of the scalar and tensor modes are very
diﬀerent. The scalar mode amplitude is set by the value
of the temperature, which slowly decreases as a func-
tion of time, leading to a red tilt. On the other hand,
the amplitude of the tensor modes is set by the pres-
sure anisotropies, which are proportional to the press-
sure, which increases as a function of time at the end of
the Hagedorn phase, thus leading to a blue tilt of the
tensor modes [25]. A careful analysis shows the follow-
ing string gas consistency relation between the scalar and
tensor modes [130]

nt (cid:39) −(ns − 1) .

(74)

Hence, measuring the value of r and the tensor tilt would
allow us to discriminate between diﬀerent early universe
scenarios.

Tensor modes on cosmological scales leave an imprint
on the spectrum of B-mode CMB polarization. Scalar
cosmological ﬂuctuations cannot produce B-mode polar-
ization at linear order in perturbation theory. Gravita-
tional waves, on the other hand, do. The challenge for
future observations is not only to detect the amplitude
of B-mode polarization, but to determine the tilt. A
determination of only the amplitude does not yield infor-
mation supporting the inﬂationary origin of ﬂuctuations
against other possible generation mechanisms6. A deter-
mination of the tilt, on the other hand, would provide
new and powerful information. If observations were to
ﬁnd a small blue tilt, this would rule out the standard
inﬂationary paradigm, and it would conﬁrm a prediction
ﬁrst made in the context of superstring theory. Note
that the direct comparison between primordial ﬂuctua-
tions and B-mode polarization is further complicated by

FIG. 6: The ekpyrotic/cyclic prediction for the power spec-
trum of gravitational waves expressed in terms of the strain

∆h ≡ √PT as a function of the frequency. The normaliza-

tion is ﬁxed at small wavelengths at which one assumes the
tensor contribution to be 4 orders of magnitude below the
BBN constraint. Using the blue spectrum to reconstruct this
contribution on large wavelengths, one thus ﬁnds a value of r
that is utterly negligible and that is therefore predicted to be
unobservable.

model therefore, the tensor-to-scalar ratio remains un-
der control and can be made compatible with the data
[83]. Similar consideration apply to the matter bounce
curvaton scenario [134].

D. Tilt of the Tensor Spectrum

All inﬂationary models based on Einstein gravity cou-
pled to matter which obeys the NEC predict a red tilt of
the tensor spectrum, i.e. nt < 0. The reason is that, dur-
ing inﬂation, the magnitude of H is a decreasing function
of time5. The amplitude of the gravitational waves on a
particular scale k is, as we have seen in Section 2.1, pro-
portional to the value of H at the time tH (k) when the
scale exits the Hubble radius during inﬂation. Larger val-
ues of k correspond to waves which exit later and hence
at smaller values of H.

In the case of simple single ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂationary
models there is, in fact, a consistency relation which con-
nects the values of the tensor tilt with the tensor to scalar

5 Models of inﬂation based on matter which violates the NEC can

yield a blue spectrum, see e.g. [135].

6 For an elaboration on this point, see [24].

the fact that there are other sources of B-mode polariza-
tion, even on cosmological scales. Quite generically, mod-
els with vector mode ﬂuctuations also induce B-mode po-
larization [137]. For example, cosmic strings can produce
direct B-mode polarization [138].

V. CHALLENGES FOR BOUNCING

COSMOLOGIES

A. Addressing the Problems of Standard Big Bang

Cosmology

Inﬂationary cosmology is a successful solution to sev-
eral problems of Standard Big Bang cosmology, most
importantly the horizon, ﬂatness, entropy and structure
formation problems. We have already addressed how the
various bouncing models considered in this review can
provide a structure formation scenario which reproduces
the successes of inﬂation. But how are the other prob-
lems addressed [27, 70]?

All bouncing models discussed here solve the horizon
problem. Since time runs from −∞, the horizon can be
inﬁnite and there is no causal obstacle to explaining the
isotropy of the cosmic microwave background (the hori-
zon problem).

Let us now turn to the ﬂatness problem. In the case
of inﬂationary cosmology it is the accelerated expansion
of space which dilutes spatial curvature compared to the
dominant contribution to the energy density. The matter
bounce scenario is neutral concerning the impact of the
spatial curvature term: in the case of a symmetric bounce
it decreases during the period of contraction by the same
amount that it increases during the expansion phase. In
the Pre-Big-Bang and Ekpyrotic scenarios the situation
is better: the contribution of spatial curvature decreases
faster during the period of contraction than it increases
during the expanding phase. String gas cosmology, on
the other hand, does not solve the ﬂatness problem.

Inﬂation also provides an elegant mechanism to pro-
duce the large entropy which our current universe con-
tains: the exponential expansion of space leads to an ex-
ponential increase in the total energy density of matter.
This energy density is converted into radiation during
the reheating phase at the end of inﬂation, producing
a large entropy. The entropy problem is only a prob-
lem if we assume that the universe begins small (Planck
size). The initial starting point in the matter bounce,
Pre-Big-Bang and Ekpyrotic cosmologies are completely
orthogonal: here it is assumed that the Universe starts
large and cold. There is then no problem whatsoever in
explaining the current entropy. If string gas cosmology
is viewed as part of a bouncing cosmology, the entropy
problem is once again absent.

In the same way that inﬂationary cosmology faces some
conceptual problems, the alternatives discussed here also
face some diﬃculties of their own. We present some,
deemed relevant, below.

B.

Initial conditions

18

In any cosmological model it is necessary to specify
initial conditions.
In a successful early universe model
the initial conditions should not have to be ﬁnely tuned.
Whether inﬂation is successful in this respect is an issue
under debate (see e.g.
[139, 140] for arguments claim-
ing that the initial conditions for inﬂation need to be
ﬁnely tuned). Indeed, it can be shown that the slow-roll
trajectory which yields inﬂation is not a local attractor
in phase space in small ﬁeld inﬂation models (models in
which the inﬂationary trajectory takes place over ﬁeld
intervals δϕ < mPl [141]. On the other hand, for large
ﬁeld inﬂation models the slow-roll trajectory is a local at-
tractor [142], even in the presence of metric ﬂuctuations
[143]. For a recent review of this issue the reader is re-
ferred to [144]. Let us recall heuristically how this works:
one starts at a density somewhat below the Planck den-
sity with a large and inhomogeneous universe, with all
ﬁeld modes with energy densities smaller than the Planck
scale excited. Space will expand, and modes with wave-
lengths smaller than the Hubble scale will be redshﬁted
while those with wavelengths larger will remain. In re-
gions where the ﬁeld values for these modes is strictly
positive, inﬂation will then commence (see [145] for a
recent numerical analysis of the dynamics).

Models of bouncing cosmologies must impose initial
conditions at a time as far remote in the past as possible,
and this corresponds to a moment when the Universe was
large and mostly empty. As shown earlier in Fig. 2, all
relevant scales are then inside the Hubble radius at the
time the initial conditions are set up. Given the cosmo-
logical background, it is hence natural to assume quan-
tum vacuum initial conditions for the ﬂuctuations. On
the other hand it is not so easy to justify the initial con-
ditions for the background (see e.g. [146] for a discussion
of this point in the context of Pre-Big-Bang cosmology).
In string gas cosmology, it is assumed that the universe
begins as a hot gas of strings in a quasi-static universe.
Hence, thermal initial conditions for the ﬂuctuations are
natural. Once again, there is a question as to what pro-
duces the initial conditions for the background.

C.

Initial Inhomogeneities

A bouncing scenario works opposite to inﬂation in the
sense that one assumes the Universe begins large and
then contracts. It would seem that any pre-existing inho-
mogeneities in a contracting universe will rapidly and au-
tomatically collapse, leading to a highly inhomogeneous
state. This however is not obviously true, as the con-
traction may be suﬃciently slow compared to the diﬀu-
sion rate of the primordial constituents.
In Ref. [147],
conditions were given for an initially large contracting
dust-dominated universe satisfying the Weyl curvature
hypothesis, to wipe out any primordial inhomogeneity
and hence to yield a satisfactory initial state out of which

one can settle vacuum initial conditions leading to our
universe. It should however be mentioned that, in this
framework, the presence, in the contracting phase, of a
cosmological constant such as that observed today, could
easily destabilize the perturbations produced in such a
universe [148], thereby leading to predictions in disagree-
ment with the current data.

D. Anisotropies

Indeed,

The question of shear in a contracting phase followed
by a bounce is central to setting constraints on such
models.
in the inﬂationary context, or even
in most expanding cosmological models, the shear, be-
having as a−6, rapidly becomes negligible compared to
any other component when the scale factor grows, and
the Friedman-Lemaˆıtre approximation of Eq. (1) can be
safely used. The contracting epoch preceding the bounc-
ing phase is the exact opposite and thus may induce a
problem [149].

To illustrate this point,

let us consider a spatially
ﬂat case and, instead of the homogeneous and isotropic
Eq. (1), assume spacetime to be well-described by an
anisotropic Bianchi I metric (still homogeneous)

ds2 = dt2 − a2(t) (cid:88)i=x,y,z

e2θi(t)dx2
i ,

(75)

where(cid:80)i θi = 0. The Einstein equations then read

leading naturally to

ρθ = pθ = (cid:80)i

˙θ2
i
16πGN

=⇒ ρθ ∝ a−6

(78)

as announced. Eq. (78) implies that the shear compo-
nent rapidly becomes negligible in a matter or radiation
dominated expanding Universe, and of course even more
so in the almost exponential case of inﬂation. During a
phase of contraction however, as the scale factor shrinks
to zero, the shear can quickly come to dominate over all
other components, eﬀectively ruining the FLRW approx-
imation with the risk of transforming a regular bounce
into a Kasner singularity through the Belinsky Khalat-
nikov Lifshitz (BKL) instability [150]. If the initial shear
stems from primordial quantum ﬂuctuations of the vec-
tor perturbations in a vacuum state, then the resulting
anisotropies remain at the same level as the scalar ones.

19

Provided the latter are well-behaved, the former must
therefore also remain small. If an initial classical shear is
present however, it will subsequently grow uncontrolled,
thereby threatening the entire scenario.

The most natural way out of the shear problem consists
in postulating an ekpyrotic phase, as discussed above. In-
deed, this phase includes a component, the scalar ﬁeld φ
with potential (35), whose equation of state is very large,

w (cid:29) 1, thus providing a contribution ρφ ∝ a−3(1+w)

which overcomes that of any anisotropy that may have
been originally present, hence preserving the FLRW na-
ture of the bounce [151]. Thus, the Ekpyrotic scenario is
completely safe from the anisotropy problem, and the
matter bounce scenario can be made safe by adding
an Ekpyrotic phase of contraction at higher curvatures.
Some matter bounce models are in fact even sensitive to
the presence of radiation [152]. See also [153] for other
approaches to addressing the anisotropy problem.

E. Relics

The early universe, whatever the model (inﬂation or
bounce), reaches extremely high energy densities, close
to the Grand Uniﬁed (GUT) or even the string or Planck
scales. This often provides an interesting means of test-
ing the otherwise unattainable theories supposed to be
valid at these scales, thus transforming cosmology into an
invaluable tool for high energy physics. Unfortunately,
every coin has two faces, and the very same attractive
property implies a rather strong caveat in the form of
constraints: high energy theories usually predict loads
of new objects such as topological defects, exotic parti-
cle or even primordial black holes (which we won’t men-
tion because estimates of their remnant density diﬀer by
many orders of magnitude depending on the model con-
sidered), which can be copiously produced during the
early stages of the universe, spoiling the subsequent evo-
lution; Ref. [154] contains a short review of these relics.
The best known example stems from supersymmetric
theories, and it is the gravitino, i.e. the supersymmet-
ric partner of the graviton. Depending on the values of
the coupling constants of the original theory, it can be a
stable particle, which may even be useful in cosmology
in the form of the missing dark matter. It can also be
produced thermally at high enough temperatures in the
radiation dominated epoch. It is then an example of a
thermal relic. Stable relics may overclose the universe.
Unstable relics, on the other hand, could interfere with
the process of cosmic nucleosynthesis.

The production of thermal relics depends on the ﬁnal
number density of relics, and hence their contribution
as dark matter, depends on particle physics parameters
and on the details of the cosmological evolution during
the early phases. If the scale of supersymmetry breaking
is higher than the maximal temperature in the expanding
Big Bang phase (which in the context of an inﬂationary
model is the reheating temperature Treheat) then graviti-

nos will not be produced and there are no constraints.
On the other hand, for a scale of supersymmetry break-
ing which would explain the particle physics hierarchy
problem and should be not too much higher than 1TeV,
the relic particles will be produced. Ref. [154] quotes the

constraint Treheat (cid:46) 4 × 1010Gev for a gravitino mass of

about 1TeV which has to be satisﬁed in order that the
relics do not overclose the Universe.

Indeed, SUSY is a key ingredient in either GUT models
or string theory, and the natural energy scale associated
with the corresponding theories is expected to be much
higher than the abovementioned value, and hence the
relic problem is an important one. However, the prob-
lem aﬀects bouncing cosmologies and simple inﬂationary
models equally.

Topological defects in general are another very com-
mon prediction of particle physics models beyond the
Standard Model. In particular, in the context of a GUT
theory with a high energy symmetry group G which is
simply connected, the vacuum manifold, i.e. the set of
ﬁeld values which minimize the potential energy function
after the symmetry has broken to the Standard Model,
is

M ∼ G/[SUc(3) × Uem(1)] ,

(79)

and its second homotopy group

π2(M) ∼ π1[SUc(3) × Uem(1)] ∼ π1[U (1)] ∼ π1(S1) ∼ Z

(80)
is non trivial. This implies that pointlike topological de-
fects, monopoles, must be produced at some stage of the
symmetry breaking scheme. Their production in stan-
dard cosmology can be estimated by phase transition
arguments, and their number density, given their sub-
sequent evolution, is found much in excess of the clo-
sure density, thereby ruining the entire universe’s evolu-
tion. This problem was part of the reason why inﬂation
was proposed, as a such a phase naturally dilutes the
monopole number density in an exponential way: it suf-
ﬁces to ensure, in a GUT implementation of inﬂation,
that the monopole producing phase takes place just be-
fore inﬂation, so that the monopoles are almost instan-
taneously washed away.

In a bouncing framework however, monopoles will be
produced if the maximal temperature is higher than the
temperature of the monopole-forming phase transition
(in the same way that they are produced in inﬂation if
the reheating temperature is higher than this scale). An
easy way for bouncing cosmologies to avoid a potential
monopole problem is therefore that the maximal temper-
ature is less than the critical temperature at which sym-
metry breaking takes place. Then, the symmetry whose
breaking produces the dangerous topological relics was
thus never restored, and therefore never broken.

Another way to avoid a monopole problem which
works independently of the cosmological scenario is to
start with a particle physics model which does not at
higher energies have a simply connected symmetry group.

20

Whereas this approach goes against the spirit of Grand
Uniﬁcation of the 1970s, it is quite realistic in the context
of current string-based particle physics models [155].

Note that a bounce may also leave behind signals of the
contracting phase via a diﬀerent dark matter distribution
which is induced during contraction [156].

F.

Instabilities

A phase of contraction is subject to many more con-
straints than a phase of expansion, because many new
instabilities can take place. In particular, scalar (curva-
ture) and vector (shear) perturbations can grow too large
at the bounce transition. Ref. [27] expands on these ques-
tions, which we brieﬂy consider below.

1. Curvature

In many bouncing models, the Bardeen potential de-
velops a constant mode, as in the usual inﬂationary sce-
nario, but, in contrast to the latter, the second mode is
growing, and could pose a threat to the overall treatment
of the bounce as a background + perturbations system.
In many situations, it was shown that this growing mode
can remain under control: there exists a set of condi-
tions for the perturbative series to make sense, and one
can almost always ﬁnd a gauge in which these conditions
are satisﬁed [157]. This also shows that not all gauges
represent valid descriptions of cosmological perturbations
near the bounce point, as the gauge-ﬁxing conditions can
become undeﬁned 7.

Even if the possibly large amplitude of perturbation
modes can be tamed down to acceptable levels, their de-
pendence in wavelength can turn an almost scale invari-
ant spectrum into a blue one, thus spoiling the predic-
tions of an otherwise working model. Let us illustrate
this phenomenon with a phase of ekpyrotic contraction
leading to the bounce. The time evolution of a mode ζk
corresponding to wavenumber k of the comoving curva-
ture perturbation (7) obeys

ζ(cid:48)(cid:48)
k + 2

actual spectrum:
c2

Two problems may then arise. The ﬁrst concerns the
in the ekpyrotic contraction regime

S (cid:39) 1, and for long wavelengths k2 (cid:29) z(cid:48)(cid:48)/z, the solu-
tion reads ζk ∼ k−1/2 +√k(cid:82) z−2dη +··· , where vacuum

initial conditions have been taken into account. The con-
stant solution term is usually that which one considers
as eventually producing the spectrum, while the second
term, much bluer, is always assumed negligible. How-
ever, as shown in [158], using the background equation

of motion ˙H = −Xp,X and the deﬁnition of z, the con-

tribution due to the integral term can be estimated. The
ratio between this contribution and the supposedly dom-
inant isocurvature component then reads

ζ int
k
ζ iso

k ∝ eNekp−2Nk ,

(84)

with Nk the number of e-folds of ekpyrosis after the mode
vk has passed the potential z(cid:48)(cid:48)/z and Nekp the total du-
ration, in e-folds, of the ekpyrotic phase. For modes of
cosmological relevance, one has Nk (cid:39) 10, while the con-
straint Nekp (cid:38) 60, so (84) spoils the overall mechanism,
yielding a blue spectrum.

The second problem potentially induced by the evolu-
tion of curvature perturbation concerns the bounce itself.
Indeed, in order that it actually takes place, a ghost con-
densate must be used, and therefore, there must exist a ﬁ-
nite amount of time around the bounce for which c2
S ≤ 0.
Now if, and this is a very model-dependent if, during
Sk2| > z(cid:48)(cid:48)/z, then
that time, there are modes satisfying |c2
the solution naturally acquires an exponentially growing
term. Bounces such as that can be saved if either the
bounce duration in conformal time is suﬃciently short,
or if |c2
S| is suﬃciently small (in practice exponentially
small) during the transition, so that the resulting expo-
nential growth is not too large.

2. Vector modes

Although we did not consider vector modes in this
short review, we must mention them in the context of
potential problems, as alluded to above.
In the usual
paradigm of an expanding universe with ordinary mat-
ter having no anisotropic stress (perfect ﬂuid or scalar
ﬁeld in practice), the vector modes are not sourced dy-
namically, and hence are merely constrained to scale as
a−2.

With the vector metric perturbation scaling as the in-
verse square of the scale factor, one ﬁnds that for a ﬂuid
with constant equation of state w, the velocity perturba-

tion reads V i ∝ k2a3w−1, which is constant for a radia-

tion dominated universe, and decreasing (resp. growing)

21

for any ﬂuid having w < 1
universe.

3 (resp. w > 1

3 ) in an expanding

Assuming they were initially not dominant, this di-
luting factor renders vector perturbations mostly harm-
less for standard cosmology and totally irrelevant after
even a short period of inﬂation took place. Obviously, in
a contracting universe, the situation can change drasti-
cally [29]. In the Pre Big-Bang scenario for instance, the
breakdown of perturbation theory seems unavoidable. It
was however argued in [159] that if a primordial compo-
nent of vector perturbation were sourced by some dynam-
ical vector ﬁeld beginning with vacuum initial conditions,
their subsequent evolution, although growing, should re-
main comparable to that of scalar perturbations, and
thus should not spoil the perturbation expansion.

It was also proposed [29] to reverse this potential
catastrophe into a window of opportunity: assuming the
growth to be somehow controlled by, say, non linear ef-
fects, during the bouncing phase, one could use the re-
sulting relatively large amplitude vector contribution to
generate a large enough primordial magnetic ﬁeld that
would explain the otherwise mysterious value necessary
to understand current data [160].

G. Curvature and the Null Energy Condition

Many bouncing models assume, to begin with, that
the curvature is to be neglected at all times, including at
the bounce itself. The argument for assuming ﬂat spatial
sections in a bouncing setup is that the curvature term
in the Friedman equation, K/a2, where K is the curva-
ture constant, will be eﬀectively negligible with respect
to any other constituent that will necessarily be present
in the model, such as matter (ρmat ∝ a−3) or radiation
(ρrad ∝ a−4), in the limit where the scale factor shrinks
indeﬁnitely a → 0. In many cases of interest, this argu-
ment is valid, but it may not be as generic as one would
spontaneously think.

First of all, in the context of general relativity, a regu-
lar bounce with ﬂat spatial sections can only take place
provided the Null Energy Condition ρ + p ≥ 0 is vio-
lated. This is the main reason for implementing bounces
by means of negative energy scalar ﬁelds, ghost conden-
sates [161], conformal galileon [162] and the like [163],
sometimes leading to instabilities that have to be dealt
with [164].

At the bouncing point, the Hubble length diverges,
H → 0, implying that the curvature contribution, if any,
ought to be exactly canceled by the sum of all positive
and negative energy contributions. Even though this re-
quirement might sound like ﬁne-tuning, it actually is not:
the constraint then provides an algebraic equation giving
the value of the scale factor, aB say, at which the bounce
takes place, as a function of the relative proportions of
the various components involved as well as on the curva-
ture radius at that moment.

Another challenge induced by curvature is related to

the question of shear.
Indeed, although the ekpyrotic
phase permits to avoid the BKL instability in the ﬂat case
[151], the presence of curvature could spoil the picture
through a mixmaster phenomenon. Space would expand
and contract in diﬀerent directions, leading to a highly
inhomogeneous and anisotropic universe [165].

VI. CONCLUSIONS

Bouncing cosmologies still have a long way to go be-
fore they can be considered as sound as the inﬂation-
ary paradigm. Whereas inﬂationary models are self-
consistent at the level of an eﬀective ﬁeld theory cou-
pled to Einstein gravity, the same is not true of bouncing
models. On the other hand, the aim of bouncing cos-
mologies is more ambitious in that one of their goals is
to address the singularity problem of our current cos-
mological models. To do this, one has to go beyond a
theory which is based on General Relativity coupled to
particle matter which obeys the usual energy conditions.
Another point to keep in mind is that inﬂationary models
which look self-consistent from the point of view of eﬀec-
tive ﬁeld theory may not be consistent from the point of
view of the complete ultraviolet theory (see e.g. [166] for
a discussion of this problem).

Having built in a resolution of the primordial singu-
larity, a contracting phase followed by a bounce pro-
vides a natural extension of the usual standard model
of cosmology. There are various scenarios in which a
scale-invariant spectrum of cosmological perturbations
emerges which can explain all of the current data. We
have discussed the matter bounce model, the Pre-Big-
Bang and Ekpyrotic scenarios, and string gas cosmology.
Theoretically, implementing a bouncing phase after a
contraction era is not so simple in the context of gen-
eral relativity, as it entails a violation of the Null Energy
Condition (except in the unlikely event that the spatial
curvature somehow plays a crucial role). This requires
unusual scalar ﬁelds like a ghost condensate, with possi-
bly many resulting instabilities. Other implementations
of a bouncing scenario, like Pre-Big-Bang cosmology or
the Ekpyrotic scenario, invoke stringy eﬀects to resolve
the singularity and to yield a bounce. String gas cos-
mology is based on fundamental principles of superstring
theory, but at the moment has no good implementation in
terms of an eﬀective action. Thus, none of the bouncing
cosmologies considered here are at the present time fully
understood. Some may argue that inﬂation, demand-
ing merely a simple scalar ﬁeld with a potential having
a plateau [167], is perhaps simpler to achieve, and thus
privileged from the Occam’s razor point of view. On the
other hand, this philosophical standpoint, useful as it is
for providing guidance to write down underlying theories,
may not be valid for actual physical phenomena such as
the evolution of the entire universe.

From the point of view of cosmological observations,
there is for the moment no need to go beyond inﬂation-

22

ary cosmology: simple single scalar ﬁeld models are con-
sistent will all cosmological observations. On the other
hand, many of the successful predictions of inﬂation de-
pend only on having a mechanism which produces an
almost scale-invariant spectrum of curvature ﬂuctuations
on scales which are super-Hubble at early times, and thus
the current observations cannot be interpreted as favor-
ing inﬂation. We have shown that even the slight red
tilt of the spectrum of curvature ﬂuctuations (excluding
purely scale-invariant perturbations at the 5σ level) is not
a unique prediction of inﬂation, but is naturally obtained
in several bouncing models, in particular in string gas
cosmology and in the matter bounce. Similarly, the ab-
sence of measurable amounts of either non-Gaussianities
or tensor modes is also obtained naturally in string gas
cosmology, although a simple matter bounce is in tension
with the data, whereas the data are in perfect agreement
with inﬂationary predictions of simple inﬂation models.
We have discussed ways in which to distinguish be-
tween pure inﬂation and pure bouncing cosmologies using
future observational results. Of particular importance is
the measurement of the amplitude and slope of the tensor
modes, since this will allow us to distinguish between the
consistency relations amongst observables predicted by
simple inﬂationary models on the one hand and bounc-
ing cosmologies (string gas cosmology in particular) on
the other.

Of course, nothing prevents that the actual history of
our universe contains both an inﬂationary phase and a
preceding bounce. At least at the level of scalar ﬁeld toy
models for matter, most mechanisms for constructing a
cosmological bounce allow for the inclusion of an inﬂa-
tionary phase after the bounce. At the time of writing,
it is not clear if, in such a scenario, one will ever be able
to ﬁnd truly discriminating measurements.

In this review we have studied bouncing cosmologies
without ever mentioning cyclic models. As we have seen,
in the bouncing models we have studied, a vacuum spec-
trum is transformed into a scale-invariant one on scales
which exit the Hubble radius during the contracting pe-
riod. In a model which is cyclic from the four space-time
dimensional point of view, the initial spectrum at the
beginning of the second phase of contraction would be
scale-invariant, and it would be transformed into a spec-
trum with index ns = −1 before the second bounce. This
processing of cosmological ﬂuctuations [168] makes four-
dimensional cyclic cosmologies unpredictive. The cyclic
Ekpyrotic scenarios [169] avoid this problem since it is
new scales which are probed in each cycle (the model
is not strictly cyclic from the four-dimensional point of
view).
