Abstract

We consider two families of planar self-similar tilings of diﬀerent nature: the tilings
consisting of translated copies of the fractal sets deﬁned by an iterated function system, and
the tilings obtained as a geometrical realization of a topological substitution (an object of
purely combinatorial nature). We establish a link between the two families in a speciﬁc case,
by deﬁning an explicit topological substitution and by proving that it generates the same
tilings as those associated with the Tribonacci Rauzy fractal.

1 Introduction
1.1 Main result and motivation
Self-similar tilings of the plane are characterized by the existence of a common subdivision rule for
each tile, such that the tiling obtained by subdivising each tile is the same as the original one, up
to a contraction. These tilings have been introduced by Thurston [Thu89] and they are studied
in several ﬁelds including dynamical systems and theoretical physics, see [BG13]. A particular
class of self-similar tilings arises from substitutions, which are “inﬂation rules” describing how to
replace a geometrical shape by a union of other geometrical shapes (within a ﬁnite set of basic
shapes). Among these, an important class consists of the planar tilings by the so-called Rauzy
fractals associated with some one-dimensional substitutions. These fractals are used to provide
geometrical interpretations of substitution dynamical systems. They also provide an interesting
class of aperiodic self-similar tilings of the plane, see [PF02, BR10].

The aim of this article is to establish a formal link between two self-similar tilings constructed

from two diﬀerent approaches:

• Using an iterated function system (IFS), that is, specifying the shapes and the positions
of the tiles with planar set equations (using contracting linear maps), which deﬁne the
tiles as unions of smaller copies of other tiles. In particular, an IFS does make use of the
Euclidean metric of the plane.
• Using a topological substitution, that is, specifying which tiles are allowed to be neighbors,
and how the neighboring relations are transferred when we “inﬂate” the tiles by substitution
to construct the tiling. With this kind of substitution, there is no use in anyway of a the
Euclidean metric: the tiles do not have a metric shape (they are just topological discs).

In other words, we tackle the following question:

Given a tiling deﬁned by an IFS, is there a topological substitution which generates an
equivalent tiling? If yes, how can we construct it? In other words, when is it possible
to describe the geometry of a self-similar tiling (geometrical constraints) by using a
purely combinatorial rule (combinatorial constraints) ?

In this article we answer this question for the tilings of the plane by translated copies of the
Rauzy fractals associated with the Tribonacci substitution (which are deﬁned by an IFS). We
deﬁne a particular topological substitution σ (Figure 4, p. 12) and we prove that the Tribonacci
fractal tiling Tfrac and the tiling Ttop generated by the topological substitution are equivalent in
a strong way. More precisely:

• Associated with the Tribonacci substitution s : 1 7→ 12, 2 7→ 13, 3 7→ 1, there is a dual
substitution E (see Section 3.2) which acts on facets in R3. Iteration of this dual substitution
gives rise to a stepped surface Σstep (a surface which is a union of facets), that is included
in the 1-neighbourhood of some (linear) plane P in R3. Projecting the stepped surface
Σstep (and its facets) on P gives rise to a tiling Tstep of P. It is known [ABI02, BR10] that
the tiling Tfrac is strongly related to a tiling Tstep.
• The topological substitution σ can be iterated on a tile C, giving rises to a 2-dimensional
CW-complex σ∞(C) homeomorphic to a plane, see Section 4.2. However, this complex is
not embedded a priori in a plane, even if it turns out that σ∞(C) can be eﬀectively realized
as a tiling Ttop of the plane, see Proposition 4.6. To locate a tile T in σ∞(C) relatively
to another one T 0, we build a vector (an “address”) ω0(T, T 0) ∈ Z3: by construction, this
vector depends a priori on the choice of a combinatorial path from T to T 0 in σ∞(C), and
we have to prove that in fact it is independent of the path, see Section 5.1.
• Since it is already explained in the litterature how to relate Tfrac and Σstep, and since we
explain how Ttop is build from σ∞(C), the main result of the paper is Theorem 5.14 that
states an explicit formula which deﬁne a bijection Ψ between tiles in σ∞(C) and facets in
Σstep: we reproduce it just below.

Theorem. The map Ψ deﬁned, for every tile T of σ∞(C), by:

s(ω0(T, C) + utype(T )), θ(type(T))]∗
is a bijection from the set of tiles of σ∞(C) to the set of facets of Σstep.

Ψ(T) = [M3

(1.1)

The notation used to state this theorem will be introduced along the paper. But we want to
stress that the fact the formula (1.1) makes use of the addressing map ω0 ensures that if two
tiles T and T 0 are close in σ∞(C), then their images Ψ(T) and Ψ(T 0) will be close in Σstep. In
fact, it is easy to convince oneself that something like that should be true by having a look at
Figure 1, where three corresponding subsets of the tilings Ttop, Tfrac and Tstep are given.

Figure 1: The three tilings Ttop, Tfrac and Tstep (from left to right).

On Figure 1, it is also worth to notice that the underlying CW-complexes of Ttop and Tstep
are not the same. Indeed, the valence of a vertex in Ttop is either 2 or 3, whereas the valence of a
vertex in Tstep can be equal to 3, 4, 5 or 6. In that sense, the two tilings Tstep and Ttop are really
diﬀerent.

We have chosen to present our results on a speciﬁc substitution rather than in a general form
because it makes presentation clearer and it avoids many “artiﬁcial” technicalities. Moreover, we
do not know what a general answer to the above question may look like. However, we give some
insight about this general question in Section 6.

1.2 Comparison of some diﬀerent notions of substitutions
The word “substitution” is used in many diﬀerent ways in the litterature. The list below contains
several such notions, going from the most geometrical one (IFS) to the most combinatorial
one (topological substitutions). This list is not complete, it only contains the notions of
substitutions that we explicitly use in this article. See [Fra08] for another survey about geometrical
substitutions.

One-dimensional symbolic substitutions These substitutions are used to generated inﬁnite
one-dimensional words which are studied mostly for their word-theoretical and dynamical
properties. An example is the Tribonacci substitution 1 7→ 12, 2 7→ 13, 3 7→ 1 deﬁned in
Section 3.3. See [PF02] for a classical reference. This is the only notion of the present list which
is only symbolic (not geometrical).

Self-aﬃne substitutions (iterated function systems) Also known as substitution Delone
sets [LW03], this notion is a particular class of iterated functions systems, where it is required
that the geometrical objects deﬁned by the IFS are compact sets which are the closure of their
interior, in such a way that tilings can be deﬁned. See Proposition 3.5 for an example of such a
deﬁnition for the Tribonacci fractal.

Dual (or “generalized”) substitutions These substitutions, introduced in [AI01] can be
seen as a discrete version of self-aﬃne substitutions. Instead of deﬁning fractal tilings in a purely
geometrical way (like with IFS), these substitutions act on unions of faces of unit cubes located
at integer coordinates. We deﬁne the associated fractal sets and tilings by iterating the dual
substitution and by taking a Hausdorﬀ limit of the (renormalized) unions of unit cube faces.
The fact that we deal with unit cube faces allows us to exploit some ﬁne combinatorial and
topological properties of the resulting patterns. This provides some powerful tools in the study
of substitution dynamics and Rauzy fractal topology. Dual substitutions are usually denoted by
E∗
1(σ), where σ is a one-dimensional symbolic substitution, See [BR10, ST09] for many references
and results, and Deﬁnition 3.2 for the particular example studied in this article.

Local substitution rules This notion has been used to tackle combinatorial questions about
substion dynamics [IO93, ABI02, ABS04, BBJS15] and have also been studied in a more general
context [Fer07, JK14]. Their aim is to get a “more combinatorial” version of dual substitutions.
Instead of computing explicitely the coordinates of the image of each unit cube face (like we do
for dual substitutions), we give some local rules (or concatenation rules) for “gluing together”
the images of two adjacent faces. The map deﬁned in Figure 10, p. 19 is an example of such a
substitution (except that it is deﬁned over topological tiles and not unit cube faces).

Topological substitutions
Introduced in [BH13], topological substitutions do not make any
use of geometry: the tiles are topological disks (with no Euclidean shape), the boundaries of
which have a simplicial structure (made of vertices and edges). It is a notion less geometrically
rigid than the previous ones. They act on CW-complexes, and the “gluing rules” are more
abstract and combinatorial than local substitution rules. A topological substitution generates a
CW-complex homeomorphic to the plane. If this complex can be geometrized as a tiling of the
plane, we say that the tiling is a topological substitutive tiling. Topological substitutions allowed
for instance to prove that there is no substitutive primitive tiling of the hyperbolic plane, even
though an explicit example of a non-primitive topological substitution which generates a tiling of
the hyperbolic plane is given in [BH13].

The examples of topological substitutions given in the present article (Figure 4 and Figure 12)
are interesting because they provide new examples of topological substitutive tilings, which can
be realized as (substitutive) tilings of the plane.

3

There is another notion, elaborated by Fernique and Ollinger [FO10] in the speciﬁc case
of Tribonacci, which lies between local substitution rules and topological substitutions. For
these so-called combinatorial substitutions, the Euclidean shape of the tiles is speciﬁed, and the
matching rules are stated in terms of colors associated with some subintervals on the boundaries
of the tiles and their images. We stress that, in that case, the Euclidean geometry is used both to
give the shape of the tiles and to specify that two tiles with same shape diﬀer with a translation
of the plane.

1.3 Organization of the article
From the point of view of the previous section, we establish a link between the IFS Rauzy fractal
tiling and the tiling deﬁned by topological substitutions ﬁrst by going from IFS substitution to
local substitution rules (using dual substitutions) and then making a link between these local
rules and the topological substitution.

In Section 3 we deﬁne the Tribonacci substitution and its associated dual and IFS geometrical
substitutions. In Section 4 we deﬁne topological substitutions and the Tribonacci topological
substitution we are interested in. The link between the IFS and the topological substitution is
ﬁnally made in Section 5. In Section 6 we describe how our results can be extended to some
other Rauzy fractal tilings, and we explain that ﬁnding a suitable topological substitution has
some dynamical implications for the underlying one-dimensional substitution.

2 Tilings
2.1 Basic deﬁnitions
In this section we recall standard notions on tiling in R2. For the references about this material
we refer the reader to [Rob04] [BH13] or [GS87]. We denote by Γ a subgroup of transformations
of R2: here, Γ will be the group of translations of R2.

A tile is a compact subset of R2 which is the closure of its interior (in most of the basic
examples, a tile is homeomorphic to a closed ball). We denote by ∂T the boundary of a tile, i.e.
∂T = T \ ˚T. Let A be a ﬁnite set of labels. A labelled tile is a pair (T, a) where T is a tile and
a an element of A. Two labelled tiles (T, a) and (T 0, a0) are equivalent if a = a0 and there exists
a translation g ∈ Γ such that T 0 = gT. An equivalence class of labelled tiles is called a prototile:
the class of (T, a) is denoted by [T, a], or simply by [T] when the context is suﬃciently clear. In
some cases, one does not need the labelling to distinguish diﬀerent prototiles: for example if we
consider a family of prototiles such that the tiles in two diﬀerent prototiles are not isometric.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A tiling X = (R2, Γ,P, T) of the plane modeled on a set of prototiles P, is a
set T of tiles, each belonging to a prototile in P, such that:

• two distinct tiles of T have disjoint interiors.
A connected ﬁnite union of (labelled) tiles is called a (labelled) patch. Two ﬁnite patches
are equivalent if they have the same number k of tiles and these tiles can be indexed T1, . . . , Tk
i = gTi for every i ∈ {1, . . . , k}. Two labelled
and T 0
i have same labelling for all i ∈ {1, . . . , k}. An equivalence
patches are equivalent if moreover Ti, T 0
class of patches is called a protopatch and denoted [P] if P is one of these patches.

The support of a patch P, denoted by supp(P), is the subset of R2 which consists of points
belonging to a tile of P. A subpatch of a patch P is a patch which is a subset of the patch P.
Let X = (R2, Γ,P, T) be a tiling, and let A be a subset of R2. A patch P occurs in A if
there exists g ∈ Γ such that for any tile T ∈ P, gT is a tile of T which is contained in A:

gT ∈ T and supp(gT) ⊆ A.

We note that any patch in the protopatch [P] deﬁned by P occurs in A. We say that the
protopatch [P] occurs in A. The language of X, denoted ΛX, is the set of protopatches of X.

When all tiles of P are euclidean polygons, the tiling is called a polygonal tiling.

2.2 Delone set deﬁned by a tiling of the plane
A Delone set in R2 is a set D of points such that there exists r, R > 0 such that every euclidean
ball of radius r contains at most one point of D and every euclidean ball of radius R contains at
least one point of D.
When a tiling of the plane X = (R2, Γ,P, T) is modeled on a ﬁnite set of prototiles P,
there is a standard way (among others) to derive a Delone set D from a tiling of the plane
X = (R2, Γ,P, T). We ﬁrst choose a point in the interior of each prototile. This choice gives us a
point xT in each tile T of X: D = {xt, T ∈ T} is a Delone set.

2.3 The 2-complex deﬁned by a tiling of the plane
Let X be a 2-dimensional CW-complex (see, for instance, [Hat02] for basic facts about CW-
complexes). The 0-cells will be called vertices, the 1-cells edges and the 2-cells faces. The
subcomplex of X which consists of cells of dimension at most k ∈ {0, 1, 2} is denoted by X k (in
particular X2 = X). We denote by |X k| the number of k-cells in X k.
Let X = (R2, Γ,P, T) be a tiling of the plane. We suppose that the tiles are homeomorphic a
a closed disc D2. This tiling deﬁnes naturally a 2-complex X in the following way. The set X0 of
vertices of X is the set of points in R2 which belong to (at least) three tiles of T . Each connected
T∈T ∂T \ X0 is an open arc. Any closed edge of X is the closure of one of
Such an edge e is glued to the endpoints x, y ∈ X0 of the arc. The set of faces of X is the set
of tiles of X. We remark that the boundary of a tile is a subcomplex of X1 homeomorphic to
the circle S1: this gives the gluing of the corresponding face on the 1-skeleton.

component of the setS

these arcs.

Let Y be a 2-dimensional CW-complex homeomorphic to the plane R2. A polygonal tiling X
is a geometric realization of Y if the 2-complex X deﬁned by X is isomorphic (as CW-complex)
to Y . In that case, each face of the complex Y can be naturally labelled by the corresponding
prototile of the tiling X.

3.1 Multisets of facets
We denote by (e1, e2, e3) the canonical basis of R3. In this article, this basis will be represented
as follows in the diﬀerent ﬁgures.

Let x ∈ Z3 and let i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. The facet [x, i]∗ of vector x and type i is a subset of R3
deﬁned by:

[x, 1]∗ = {x + λe2 + µe3 : λ, µ ∈ [0, 1]} =
[x, 2]∗ = {x + λe1 + µe3 : λ, µ ∈ [0, 1]} =
[x, 3]∗ = {x + λe1 + µe2 : λ, µ ∈ [0, 1]} = .

On each of the previous pictures, the symbol • represents the endpoint of the vector x. We set
F = {[x, i]∗, x ∈ Z3, i ∈ {1, 2, 3}}.
Let W be the set of maps from F to Z≥0: such a map is called a weight function. A weight
function w ∈ W gives a weight w([x, i]∗) ∈ Z≥0 to any facet. Equipped with the addition of
maps, W is a monoid.
A multiset of facets is a map m : Z3 → Z3≥0. We denote by M the set of multisets of
facets. The set M, equipped with the addition of maps, is a monoid. A multiset m ∈ M deﬁnes
a weight function wm ∈ W by declaring that wm([x, i]∗) is the ith coordinate of m(x). The map

M → W
m 7→ wm

is an isomorphism of monoids. The inverse of the map is given by

M

The group Z3 acts naturally on M: if v ∈ Z3, m ∈ M then

m + v : x 7→ m(x − v).

The support supp(w) of a weight function w is the union of facets which have positive

weight:

supp(w) = [

[x, i]∗.

w([x,i]∗)>0

supp(m) = supp(wm).

It is a subset of R3. The support supp(m) of a multiset of facets m is the support of the
corresponding weight function:

Let W◦ ⊂ W be the subset of weight functions which take values in {0, 1}. We denote by
M◦ the corresponding subset of M: a multiset of facets m is in M◦ if and only if for all x ∈ Z3,
the coordinates of m(x) are in {0, 1}.
Remark 3.1. We notice that a multiset of facets in M◦ (or a weight function in W◦) is totally
determined by its support.

3.2 Dual substitutions
In this Section we quickly review a construction due to Arnoux-Ito [AI01] that associates to
a unimodular substitution s what is called a dual substitution E∗
1(s). For details we refer
to [AI01, BR10]. In particular, this construction can be applied to the Tribonacci substitution
to lead the dual substitution E deﬁned below. The deﬁnition of a substitution will be given in
Section 3.3.

This matrix has characteristic polynomial X3 − X2 − X − 1. Its dominant eigenvalue β is a Pisot
number: β > 1 and its conjugates α, α ∈ C are such that |α| < 1. The euclidean space R3 is
hence decomposed as the direct sum of the expanding line (spanned by the left β-eigenvector
vβ of Ms) and the contracting plane P associated with the complex eigenvalues α, α. Let
πβ : R3 → P be the projection on P along the line Rvβ. We denote by h : P → P the restriction
the action of Ms to P, which is contracting because |α| < 1. Remark that Ms, h, πβ commute.
Deﬁnition 3.2. We deﬁne



E :

s x +(cid:0)[0, 1]∗ ∪ [0, 2]∗ ∪ [0, 3]∗(cid:1)

[x, 3]∗ 7→ M−1

s x + [e3, 1]∗
s x + [e3, 2]∗.

Alternatively E can be deﬁned using multisets as following:
• The image of [x, 1]∗ by E is the multiset (Z3, m) where

• The image of [x, 2]∗ by E is the multiset (Z3, m) where

m(y) =

(1, 1, 1)

if y 6= M−1

if y = M−1

m(y) =

if y 6= M−1

if y = M−1
s x.

We extend E to M by declaring that the image of a union of faces is the union of the images
of these faces (the multiplicities of faces add up). We also note for future application that for all
x, u ∈ Z3, and for all i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, we have

E(cid:0)[x, i]∗ + u(cid:1) = E[x, i]∗ + M−1

s u

In practice, in order to simplify the notation, we represent E by the following pictures

where the black dots in the preimages stand for x, and the black dots in the images stand for
s x. We denote the Euclidean scalar product of to vectors u, v ∈ R3 by hu, vi, and we deﬁne
M−1
U as the multiset of facets [0, 1]∗ ∪ [0, 2]∗ ∪ [0, 3]∗.
Proposition 3.3 ([AI01, ABI02, ABS04]).

• The restriction πβ : Σstep → P of πβ to Σstep is an homeomorphism.

Tstep is:

[

i∈{1,2,3}

{πβ([0, i]∗) + πβ(x) : x ∈ Z3, 0 ≤ hx, vβi < hei, vβi}.

We say that a vector x ∈ Z3 lies in Σstep if there exists i ∈ {1, 2, 3} such that [x, i]∗ is a subset
of Σstep. Proposition 3.3 implies that the set of vectors lying in Σstep is precisely V = V1 ∪V2 ∪V3,
where

Vi = {x ∈ Z3 : 0 ≤ hx, vβi < hei, vβi}.

Remark 3.4. We set Di = πβ(Vi). Then D = D1 ∪ D2 ∪ D3 is a Delone set in P. The tiling
Tstep is obtained by putting in P a tile of type i (i.e. a translated image of πβ([0, i]∗)) at each
vector in Di.
3.3 Link between the tiling Tstep and the Rauzy fractal
In this section we recall basic facts about Rauzy fractals and substitutions [PF02]. We consider
the free monoid {1, 2, 3}∗ and the Tribonacci substitution s : {1, 2, 3}∗ → {1, 2, 3}∗, which is
a morphism deﬁned by

s : 1 7→ 12

2 7→ 13

3 7→ 1.

Denote by u = 12131 . . . the inﬁnite word on the alphabet {1, 2, 3} such that s(u) = u. In fact,
for all n ∈ N, sn(1) is a preﬁx of sn+1(1), so that u = lim+∞ sn(1). We denote by ui ∈ {1, 2, 3}
the i-th letter in u: u = u1u2u3 . . . with u1 = 1, u2 = 2, u3 = 3.
its ith column vector is equal to P(s(i)),
where P be the abelianization map from {1, 2, 3}∗ to Z3 deﬁned by P(w) = (|w|1,|w|2,|w|3) and
|w|i stands for the number of occurrences of i in w. Consistently with the notation of Section 3.2,
we have:

Let us deﬁne Ms the incidence matrix of s:

1 1 1

Ms =

In the following proposition, we go on using the notation introduced in Section 3.2.

Proposition 3.5 ([Rau82, CS01, AI01]).

(cid:0)P(u1 . . . uj−1)(cid:1), j ∈ N(cid:9) = R1 ∪ R2 ∪ R3

are compact subsets of P (where A denotes the closure of a subset A in P).

• The Ri’s are the solution of the following IFS:



R1 = hR1 ∪ hR2 ∪ hR3
R2 = hR1 + πβ(e1)
R3 = hR2 + πβ(e1).

• There exists a

tiling of the plane P, that will be denoted by Tfrac, whose set of tiles is:
{Ri + πβ(x) : x ∈ Z3, 0 ≤ hx, vβi < hei, vβi}.

i∈{1,2,3}

The set R is called the Rauzy fractal of s and R1,R2,R3 are the subtiles of R.

Remark 3.6. Comparing Proposition 3.5 and Proposition 3.3, we see that the same formula is
used to address the tiles in Tfrac and Ttop. Indeed, the tiling Tfrac is obtained by putting in P a
tile of type i (i.e. a translated image of Ri) at each vector in Di, where the sets Di are precisely
the ones of Remark 3.4. This explicits the strong relation between the two tilings Tfrac and Ttop.

4 The Tribonacci topological substitution
4.1 Topological substitutions
We recall some facts about (2-dimensional) topological substitutions. The mathematical content
of this section is essentially contained in[BH13]: we include it here for completeness. The
vocabulary we will use in the present setting is often common to the one of tilings: the context is
in general suﬃcient to prevent any ambiguity.

4.1.1 General deﬁnition
A topological k-gon (k ≥ 3) is a 2-dimensional CW-complex made of one face, k edges and k
vertices, which is homeomorphic to a closed disc D2, and such that the 1-skeleton is the boundary
S1 of the closed disc. A topological polygon is a topological k-gon for some k ≥ 3.
We consider a ﬁnite set T = {T1, . . . , Td} of topological polygons. The elements of T are
called prototiles, and T is called the set of prototiles.
If Ti is a ni-gon, we denote by
Ei = {e1,i, . . . , eni,i} the set of edges of Ti.
A patch P modeled on T is a 2-dimensional CW-complex homeomorphic to the closed disc
D2 such that for each closed face f of P, there exists a prototile Ti ∈ T and a homeomorphism
τf : f → Ti which respects the cellular structure. Then Ti = τf(f) is called the type of the face
f, and denoted by type(f). The type of an edge e of Ti, denoted by type(e), is τ(e). An edge e
of P is called a boundary edge if it is contained in the boundary S1 of the disc D2 ∼= P. Such
a boundary edge is contained in exactly one closed face of P. An edge e of P which is not a
boundary edge is called an interior edge. An interior edge is contained in exactly two closed
faces of P. In the following deﬁnition, and for the rest of this article, the symbol t stands for
the disjoint union.
Deﬁnition 4.1. A topological pre-substitution is a triplet (T , σ(T ), σ) where:

1. T = {T1, . . . , Td} is a set of prototiles,
2. σ(T ) = {σ(T1), . . . , σ(Td)} is a set of patches modeled on T ,

3. σ : G

Ti → G

i∈{1,...,d}

i∈{1,...,d}

Ti → σ(Ti), such that the image of a vertex of Ti is a vertex of the boundary of σ(Ti).

σ(Ti) is a homeomorphism, which restricts to homeomorphisms

Compatible topological pre-substitution Let T = {T1, . . . , Td} be the set of prototiles of
σ, and let Ei = {e1,i, . . . , eni,i} be the the set of edges of Ti (i ∈ {1, . . . , d}). We denote by E
the set of all edges of all the prototiles of T : E = tiEi. A pair (e, e0) ∈ E × E is balanced if
σ(e) and σ(e0) have the same length (= the number of edges in the edge path). The ﬂip is the
involution of E × E deﬁned by (e, e0) 7→ (e0, e). The quotient of E × E obtained by identifying
a pair and its image by the ﬂip is denoted by E2. We denoted by [e, e0] the image of a pair

9

1 . . . e0

p (with ei, e0

i ∈ E for i ∈ {1, . . . , p}). Then the [ei, e0

(e, e0) ∈ E × E in E2. Since the ﬂip preserves balanced pairs, the notion of “being balanced"
is well deﬁned for elements of E2. The subset of E2 which consists of balanced elements is
called the set of balanced pairs, and denoted by B. Let [e, e0] ∈ B a balanced pair. In other
words, σ(e) and σ(e0) are paths of edges which have same length say p ≥ 1: σ(e) = e1 . . . ep,
i] ∈ E2 (i ∈ {1, . . . , p}) are
σ(e0) = e0
called the descendants of [e, e0].
Now, we consider a patch P modeled on T . An interior edge e of P deﬁnes an element [ε, ε0]
of E2. Indeed, let f and f0 be the two faces adjacent to e in P. We denote by ε = τf(e) the edge
of type(f) corresponding to e, and by ε0 = τf0(e) the edge of type(f0) corresponding to e. The
edge e is said to be balanced if [ε, ε0] is balanced.
We deﬁne, by induction on p ∈ N, the notion of a p-compatible topological pre-substitution
σ. To any p-compatible topological pre-substitution σ we associate a new pre-substitution which
will be denoted by σp.
Deﬁnition 4.2.

1. Any pre-substitution (T , σ(T ), σ) is 1-compatible.
2. A pre-substitution (T , σ(T ), σ) is said to be p-compatible (p ≥ 2) if:

(a) (T , σ(T ), σ) is (p − 1)-compatible
(b) for all i ∈ {1, . . . , d}, every interior edge e of σp−1(Ti) is balanced.

We suppose now that (T , σ(T ), σ) is a p-compatible pre-substitution. Then we deﬁne σp(Ti)
(i ∈ {1, . . . , d}) as the patch obtained in the following way:
We consider the collection of patches σ(type(f)) for each face f of σp−1(Ti). Then, if f and
f0 are two faces of σp−1(Ti) adjacent along some edge e, we glue, edge to edge, σ(type(f)) and
σ(type(f0)) along σ(τf(e)) and σ(τf0(e)). This is possible since the p-compatibility of σ ensures
that the edge e is balanced. The resulting patch σp(Ti) is deﬁned by:



G

σp(Ti) =

σ(type(f))

f face of σp−1(Ti)

,

∼

where ∼ denotes the gluing. We deﬁne σp(T ) to be the set {σp(T1), . . . , σp(Td)}.
σi,p : σp−1(Ti) → σp(Ti) thanks to the p-compatibility hypothesis:

The map σ induces a natural map on the faces of each σp−1(Ti) which factorizes to a map

f face of σp−1(Ti)

σi,p

i : Ti → σp(Ti)
σp

We note that σi,p is a homeomorphism which sends vertices to vertices. Then we deﬁne the

map

i = σi,p ◦ σp−1

as the composition: σp
. This is an homemorphism which sends vertices to vertices.
Then σp is naturally deﬁned such that the restriction of σp on Ti is σp
i . We remark that
σ1 = σ. We have thus obtained a topological pre-substitution (T , σp(T ), σp). A topological
pre-substitution is compatible if it is p-compatible for every integer p.

i

Checking compatibility In this subsection we give an algorithm which decides whether a
pre-substitution is compatible.
Suppose that σ is p-compatible. We deﬁne Wp as the set of elements [ε, ε0] ∈ E2 such that
there exists i ∈ {1, . . . , d}, as well as two faces f and f0 in σp(Ti) glued along an edge e, such
that τf(e) = ε and τf0(e) = ε0. The topological pre-substitution σ is (p + 1)-compatible if and
only if Wp is contained in the set of balanced pairs B: Wp ⊆ B. Then:

10

G

∼y

G

y∼

σp(Ti)

• either Wp (cid:42) B: the algorithm stops, telling us that the substitution is not compatible,
• or Wp ⊆ B: then we deﬁne Vp = Vp−1 ∪ Wp.

By convention we settle V0 = ∅.
Suppose that σ is compatible. The sequence (Vp)p∈N is an increasing sequence (for the
inclusion) of subsets of the ﬁnite set E2. Hence there exists some p0 ∈ N such that Vp0+1 = Vp0
(and thus Vp = Vp0 for all p ≥ p0). The algorithm stops at step p0 + 1 (where p0 is the smallest
integer such that Vp0+1 = Vp0), telling that σ is compatible.
The heredity graph of edges of σ, denoted E(σ), is deﬁned in the following way. The set
of vertices of E(σ) is Vp0. There is an oriented edge from vertex [e, e0] to vertex [, 0] if [, 0] is a
descendant of [e, e0].
Core of a topological pre-substitution Let P be a patch modeled on T = {T1, . . . , Td}.
The thick boundary B(P) of P is the closed sub-complex of P consisting of the closed faces
which contain at least one vertex of the boundary ∂P of P. The core Core(P) of P is the
closure in P of the complement of B(P): in particular, Core(P) is a closed subcomplex of P, see
Figure 2.

Figure 2: The thick boundary is the grey subcomplex and the core is the white subcomplex.
A topological pre-substitution (T , σ(T ), σ) has the core property if there exist i ∈ {1 . . . d}

and k ∈ N such that the core of σk(Ti) is non-empty.
Deﬁnition 4.3. A topological substitution is a pre-substitution which is compatible and has
the core property.

4.1.2 Topological plane obtained by inﬂation
Consider a tile T ∈ T such that the core of σ(T) contains a face of type T. Then, we can identify
the tile T with a subcomplex of the core of σ(T). By induction, σk(T) is thus identiﬁed with a
subcomplex of σk+1(T) (k ∈ N). We deﬁne σ∞(T) as the increasing union:

∞[

σ∞(T) =

σk(T).

k=0

By construction, the complex σ∞(T) is homeomorphic to R2. We say that such a complex is
obtained by inﬂation from σ. Moreover this complex can be labelled by the types of the
topological polygons. We notice that σ induces an homeomorphism of σ∞(T),
We denote by Pσ the set of patches in the complex σ∞(T). We notice that σ naturally
deﬁnes a map Pσ → Pσ, that is still denoted by σ. To be more precise, given a patch P ∈ Pσ,
there is some k ∈ N such that P ⊆ σk(P) ⊂ σ∞(P), so that σ(P) ⊆ σk+1(P) ⊂ σ∞(P): this
patch σ(P) ∈ Pσ does not depend on the choice of k.
We denote by Tσ the set of tiles in the complex σ∞(T): Tσ is a subset of Pσ. See Figure 3

for examples of such topological complexes generated by topological substitutions.

deﬁnitions of σ and τ are respectively given in Figure 4 (p. 12) and Figure 12 (p. 24).

4.2 The Tribonacci topological substitution
We ﬁrst deﬁne a topological substitution σ. Then we explain how to derive a tiling of R2 as a
geometrical realization of the patches generated by σ.

4.2.1 Deﬁnition of the topological substitution
We consider the Tribonacci topological pre-substitution σ deﬁned on Figure 4. There are three
prototiles: two of them, A and B, are hexagons, while the third one, C, is a decagon. The images
of these prototiles (together with the labelling of the vertices and the images of the vertices) are
given on Figure 4. In practice, we will denote by Ai the vertex i of A, and by Ai(i+1) the edge of
A joining Ai and Ai+1 (and so on for B and C).

4.2.2 Conﬁgurations at the vertices
We denote by V the set of vertices of the prototiles A, B, C. The heredity graph of vertices is
an oriented graph denoted by V(σ). The set of vertices of V(σ) is the set V . Let T, T 0 ∈ {A, B, C},
and let v be a vertex of T and v0 be a vertex of T 0: there is an oriented edge in V(σ) from v to
v0 if σ(v) is a vertex of type v0 of a tile of type T 0.
The graph V(σ) is given in Figure 7. It can be used to control the valences of the vertices in
σ∞(C) thanks to the following property proved in [BH13]. A vertex v ∈ V is a divided vertex
if there are at least two oriented edges in V(σ) coming out of v. We denote by VD the subset of
V which consists of all divided vertices. The following properties are equivalent, see [BH13]:

Figure 7: The heredity graph of the vertices V(σ).

• The complex σ∞(C) has bounded valence.
• Every inﬁnite oriented path in V(σ) crosses only ﬁnitely many vertices of VD.
• The oriented cycles of V(σ) do not cross any vertex of VD.
Lemma 4.5. The valence of each vertex in σ∞(C) is bounded.
Proof. We consider Figure 7. Remark that VD = {C0, C5}. Moreover, neither C0 nor C5 is
crossed by an oriented cycle of V(σ). Hence the valence of the vertices of σ∞(C) is bounded by
the previous property.

Now we introduce another graph, which is called the conﬁguration graph of vertices and
is denoted by C(σ). We consider the equivalence relation on k-tuples of elements of V (k ∈ N)
generated by:

(x1, . . . , xk−1, xk) ∼ (xk, x1, . . . , xk−1) and (x1, x2, . . . , xk) ∼ (xk, . . . , x2, x1).

Let [x1, . . . , xk] denote the equivalence class of (x1, . . . , xk). Let K be the maximal valence of a
vertex in σ∞(C). Let W be the set of equivalence classes of k-tuples with 2 ≤ k ≤ K. A vertex
v in the interior of a patch σn(C) (n ≥ 1) deﬁnes an element [x1, . . . , xk] ∈ W (where k is the
valence of v). Indeed, the faces adjacent to v are cyclically ordered, and xi is the type of the
vertex of the i-th face which is glued on v.
We deﬁne the oriented graph C(σ) as follows. Let W0 be the subset of W deﬁned by the
vertices occuring in the interior of some σn(C) for n ≥ 1. An element of W0 is called a vertex
conﬁguration. The set of vertices of C(σ) is W0. For any s ∈ W0, we choose some T ∈ T , n ≥ 1
and v a vertex in the interior of σn(T) which deﬁnes s. Let s0 the element of W0 deﬁned by σ(v).
There is an oriented edge in C(σ) from s to s0. We notice that this construction does not depend
of the choice of T and n.
In practice, to build the graph C(σ), we ﬁrst remark that a vertex v in the interior of some
σn(C) (n ≥ 1) is either the image of a vertex in the interior of σn−1(C), or is in the interior of a
path of edges which is the image of an interior edge of σn−1(C). Thus we ﬁrst make the list of
vertex conﬁgurations for:

• vertices in the interior of the image of a tile: we get [C5, A4] et [C6, A3, B5];
• vertices in the interior of the image of an interior edge. These ones can be derived from

the vertices of E(σ) with a least 2 outing edges. There are 3 such vertices in of E(σ):

– [B45, C76] which gives rise to vertex conﬁgurations [C4, C0] and [C5, C9],
– [C12, B21] and [C12, C76] which gives rise to vertex conﬁgurations [C4, C0] and [C5, C9].
Then we iteratively compute the vertex conﬁgurations obtained as the image under σn of the
vertex conﬁgurations in {[C5, A4], [C6, A3, B5], [C4, C0], [C5, C9], C4, C0], [C5, C9]}. The graph
C(σ) is represented on Figure 8.

4.2.3 A geometric realization of σ∞(C)
Proposition 4.6. The complex σ∞(C) can be realized as a tiling of R2. This tiling is denoted
by Ttop.
Proof. We ﬁrst recall that a 2-dimensional CW-complex with hexagonal faces such that each
edge belongs to 2 faces and each vertex belongs to 3 faces is isomorphic to the 2-dimensional
CW-complex Xhex deﬁned by the tiling of R2 by regular euclidean hexagons.

Let Chex the patch made of two hexagonal faces obtained by dividing C along an edge between
vertices C0 and C5. Given a patch P made of tiles of types A, B and C, we build a patch Phex
made of hexagonal faces by replacing the faces of type C by Chex.
We claim that (σ∞(C))hex = Xhex. Indeed, the vertex conﬁgurations of σ∞(C) are given by
the vertices of the graph C (see Figure 8), and for every of them, we check that P = Phex for the
corresponding patch P.
Since (σ∞(C))hex = Xhex, it is straightforward to derive that σ∞(C) can be geometrically
realized as a tiling of R2, where A and B are realized by regular hexagons, and C by a decagon
obtained by gluing two regular hexagons along an edge.
Remark 4.7. In particular, we can now precise Lemma 4.5: The valence of a vertex in σ∞(C)
is either 2 or 3.

4.3 The pointed topological substitution ˆσ
Let PP be the set of pairs (P, T) where P is a patch in σ∞(C) and T is a tile in σ∞(C). Such a
pair (P, T) ∈ PP is a pointed patch, and T is the base tile of the pointed patch (P, T).

For our purposes, we need to consider a kind of “pointed” version ˆσ of σ: this will be a map

ˆσ :

PP → PP

(P, T)

7→ (σ(P), b(T)).

To completely deﬁne ˆσ, it remains now to deﬁne the map b. Let T be a tile of σ∞(C). Then
σ(T) is a patch of σ∞(C). If σ(T) is a tile (this is the case when T is of type A or B), then we
simply set b(T) = σ(T). If T is of type C, then we deﬁne b(T) as the tile of type C in σ(T).
Remark 4.8. This last choice is a bit arbitrary: in particular, we could have considered other
versions of ˆσ where, for a tile T of type C, b(T) would be the tile of type A (or B) in σ(T).
In that case, we would have to modify accordingly the deﬁnition of the addressing map ω0 of
Section 5.1.3.

5 Link between dual and topological substitutions
5.1 Addressing map
5.1.1 Notation
Let σ be the Tribonacci topological substitution deﬁned in Section 4.2. We denote by P a patch
of σ∞(C), or possibly P = σ∞(C).
Deﬁnition 5.1. Consider a positive integer n. A path of tiles γ in P is a sequence T0, . . . , Tn
of tiles of P such that two consecutive tiles Ti, Ti+1 are diﬀerent and share (at least) one common
edge for all i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1}. The integer n + 1 is the length of the path γ = T0, . . . , Tn. The
set {T0, . . . , Tn} ⊂ P is called the support of γ in P. When T0 = Tn, γ is a loop of tiles.
The integer n is the length of the loop γ = T0, . . . , Tn. The path γ = T0, . . . , Tn and the path
γ0 = T 0
0 = Tn. The concatenation of these paths is the
path of tiles γγ0 = T0, . . . , Tn, T 0

m can be concatenated if T 0

0, . . . , T 0

1, . . . , T 0
m.

Let γ be a loop of tiles in σ∞(C). Among the connected components of the complementary of
the support of γ, there is exactly one, denoted by C∞(γ), which contains an inﬁnite number of tiles.
We denote by C0(γ) the complement of C∞(γ): it is a patch, in particular it is homeomorphic to
a disc. Alternatively C0(γ) is the smallest subpatch of σ∞(C) containing the support of γ. We
deﬁne the area of γ to be the number of tiles in C0(γ):
Area(γ) = |C0(γ)|.

Now we deﬁne an equivalence relation on paths of tiles which will deﬁne a protopath of

tiles: The path γ = T0, . . . , Tn and the path γ0 = T 0

0, . . . , T 0

m are equivalent if

• m = n
• For every i ∈ {0, . . . , n}, Ti and T 0
• The gluing edges of Ti and Ti+1 have the same type as the gluing edges of T 0

i are in the same prototile.

i and T 0

i+1.

In the same way we deﬁne the notion of protoloop. The notions of concatenation, area and
length naturally extend to protopaths.

5.1.2 Additivity
Let P be patch in σ∞(C). By deﬁnition, P is homeomorphic to a disc and its boundary is
homeomorphic to the circle S1. Let T be a tile in P, the wreath of T in P is the subset
of P (cid:114) {T} made of tiles that have at least one vertex in common with T. We denote it by
WreathP (T). A cut tile of P is a tile whose wreath in P is not connected.

Let T be a cut tile of P. Then P (cid:114) T has at least 2 connected components, and each of these

components is a patch.
Lemma 5.2. Let P be a ﬁnite patch in σ∞(C). There exists one tile of P which is not a cut
tile and has one edge in the boundary of P.
Proof. Pick a tile T0 in P which has a vertex in the boundary of P. If T0 is not a cut tile, we
are done. Otherwise, because P is homeomorphic to a disk, P (cid:114) T0 has at least two connected
components: we choose one of them that we denote by P1. Pick a tile T1 in P1 which has a
vertex in the boundary of P. If T1 is not a cut tile, we are done. Otherwise, P (cid:114) T1 has at least
two connected components, and at least one of them is included in P1: we choose one of these
ones, that we denote by P2. If every tile with one edge in the boundary is a cut-tile we obtain an
inﬁnite number of nested connected components which is a contradiction with the fact that P
contains a ﬁnite number of tiles.

16

Let P be the set of protopaths of tiles in σ∞(C). A map ω : P → Z3 is additive if for every
γ, γ0 ∈ P that can be concatenated, we have ω(γγ0) = ω(γ) + ω(γ0). Hence, an additive map
ω : P → Z3 is uniquely deﬁned by the image of the protopaths of length 2.
Deﬁnition 5.3. Let P0 ⊆ P be the subset consisting of protoloops γ = T0, . . . , Tn (with T0 = Tn)
of tiles in σ∞(C) such that

• for every i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}, Ti ∈ WreathC0(γ)(T0),
• for every i 6= j ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}, Ti 6= Tj.

We notice that P0 contains all protoloops of lentgh 2.
Lemma 5.4. The set P0 is ﬁnite.
Proof. The valence of every vertex in σ∞(C) is bounded (by 3, see Lemma 4.5), we deduce that
the cardinlity is ﬁnite.

It is possible to produce an explicit list of the elements in P0. We detail below all the

elements of P0 of length 3.

Lemma 5.5. Let ω : P → Z3 an additive map such that ω vanishes on the elements of P0 .
Then ω vanishes on every protoloop in σ∞(C).
Proof. The proof is by induction on the area of the protoloop of tiles γ in σ∞(C). According to
Deﬁnition 5.1, a loop of tiles has length a least 2, and thus also area at least 2. Moreover, a loop
of tiles γ with area 2 is the concatenation of a certain number of copies of a same loop of tiles of
length 2 γ0 = T0, T1, T0. Since any loop of length 2 is in P0, we get that ω(γ0) = 0. By additivity
of ω, we derive that ω(γ) = 0.
Suppose that ω vanishes on every loop in σ∞(C) of area at most k. Let γ = T0, . . . , Tn be
a loop of area k + 1. By Lemma 5.2 there exists a tile T in C0(γ) which is not a cut-tile and
has one edge in the boundary of C0(γ). The tile T may occur several times in γ, and for each
occurrence we will successively act as follows.

Let Ti = T be an occurrence of T in γ.
• If Ti−1 = Ti+1, we set γ0 = T0, . . . , Ti−1 = Ti+1, . . . , Tn. Then by additivity of ω,

ω(γ) = ω(γ0) + ω(Ti−1, Ti) + ω(Ti, Ti+1) = ω(γ0).

• If Ti−1 6= Ti+1 ∈ WreathC0(γ)(T), see Figure 9. Since T is not a cut tile of C0(γ), there

d, Ti+1, T

is a loop of tiles, and since T has at least an edge in the boundary of C0(γ), we see that
γ00 ∈ P0. In particular, ω(γ00) = 0. We set
γ0 = T0, . . . , Ti−1, T 0

d, Ti+1, . . . , Tn.

1, . . . , T 0

Then by additivity of ω,

ω(γ) = ω(γ0) + ω(γ00) = ω(γ0).

After proceeding as above for each occurrence of T in γ, we end up with a loop of tiles γ0
such that ω(γ) = ω(γ0) and Area(γ0) ≤ k (since the support of γ0 is included in C0(γ) (cid:114) {T}).
We conclude using the induction hypothesis on γ0.

5.1.3 The addressing map ω0
Now we deﬁne the map ω0 that will be used in the sequel of this paper.

• First we deﬁne ω0 on the set of protopaths of length 2. The protopaths of length 2 in
σ∞(C) form a ﬁnite set due to the heredity graph of edges. In Figure 10 we give this list
and deﬁne the map on this set. For each protopath γ = (T0, T1) of Figure 10, T0 is the
white tile. Moreover, we set ω0(T1, T0) = −ω0(T0, T1).

• If γ = T0, T1, . . . , Tn is a protopath of length n + 1 ≥ 3, we set

nX

i=1

ω0(γ) =

ω0(Ti−1, Ti).

This deﬁnes the map ω0 : P → Z3.

• It remains to check that the map ω0 vanishes on the elements of P0. This a ﬁnite process,
since Lemma 5.4 ensures that P0 is ﬁnite. We detail below an instance of the kind of easy
computations that have to be carried on.

According to Lemma 5.5, we thus obtain the following theorem.

Proposition 5.6. The map ω0 : P → Z3 deﬁned previously is additive, and vanishes on each
protoloop of tiles.

The following proposition will be used afterwards.
Proposition 5.7. Let T, T 0 be tiles in σ∞(C). Then

ω0(cid:0)b(T), b(T 0)(cid:1) = M−1

(5.1)
Proof. Proposition 5.6 ensures that ω0 is additive. It is thus suﬃcient to prove (5.1) for adjacent
tiles T, T 0. Moreover, ω0(T, T 0) only depends on the protopath (T, T 0) deﬁned by the adjacent
tiles T, T 0. There is only a ﬁnite number of protopaths of length 2 to consider: those which are
listed on Figure 10. We detail below an instance of the kind of easy computations that have to
be carried on. Suppose that (T, T 0) is the following protopath:

s ω0(T, T 0).

By deﬁnition of ω0 (Figure 10) we have ω0(T, T 0) = (−1, 2,−1). We compute ω0(b(T), b(T 0) by

5.2 From the topological patches to the stepped surface
Let (P, T) a pointed patch formed by a patch P of σ∞(C) and a tile T of σ∞(C). We are going
to associate to (P, T) a multiset of facets ϕ0(P, T) ∈ M, see Section 3.1. When P is equal to the
tile T, we simply denote the pointed patch (T, T) by T.

Let Tσ denote the set of tiles of σ∞(C), as in Section 4.1.2. First, we deﬁne a map Φ : Tσ → M

so that two tiles of the same type have the same image. This map Φ is deﬁned by setting:

Φ(cid:0) A(cid:1) =

= E([0, 1]∗), Φ(cid:16)

(cid:17) =

B

= E2([0, 1]∗), Φ(cid:16)

(cid:17) =

C

= E3([0, 1]∗).

Alternatively:

Φ(A) = E3([0, 3]∗) + e3 − e1, Φ(B) = E3([0, 2]∗) + e2 − e1, Φ(C) = E3([0, 1]∗).

In the pictures representing multisets, the symbol • indicates the origin of R3. For instance

the image of A is the multiset m : Z3 → Z3≥0 deﬁned by

(0

m(y) =

if y 6= (1, 0,−1)
if y = (1, 0,−1).

(1, 1, 1)

19

For a patch P and a tile T, we consider T 0 another tile and γ a path of tiles from T to T 0.
By Proposition 5.6, the vector ω0(γ) only depends on T and T 0, and not on the choice of the
path γ. Thus we denote it by ω0(T, T 0).
Deﬁnition 5.8. Let P be a patch of σ∞(C), and let T be a tile of σ∞(C). The multiset of
facets ϕ0(P, T) ∈ M is deﬁned by:

ϕ0(P, T) = X

(cid:16)Φ(T 0) + ω0(T, T 0)(cid:17)

.

T 0∈P

Remark 5.9. By deﬁnition, we notice that ϕ0(T, T) = Φ(T) for every tile T in σ∞(C).

The next two lemmas state useful properties of the map ϕ0. By deﬁnition of ϕ0 and by

additivity of ω0, we derive immediately the following lemma.
Lemma 5.10. Let P be a patch of σ∞(C), and let T, T 0 be tiles of σ∞(C). Then we have
ϕ0(P, T) = ϕ0(P, T 0) + ω0(T, T 0).

Let P1, P2 be patches in σ∞(C). We denote by P1 ∩ P2 the (possibly empty) patch in σ∞(C)
made of tiles belonging to both P1 and P2: this is the standard deﬁnition of “intersection of
patches”.
Lemma 5.11. Let P1, P2 be patches of σ∞(C),

and let T be a tile of σ∞(C).
• If P1 and P2 have no tile in common, then ϕ0(P1 ∪ P2, T) = ϕ0(P1, T) + ϕ0(P2, T).
• In the general situation we have ϕ0(P1 ∪ P2, T) = ϕ0(P1, T) + ϕ0(P2, T) − ϕ0(P1 ∩ P2, T).
Proof. The second point is a direct consequence of the ﬁrst one. By deﬁnition, and because
P1, P2 have no tile in common, we have

ϕ0(P1 ∪ P2, T) = X
= X

(cid:16)Φ(T 0) + ω0(T, T 0)(cid:17)
(cid:16)Φ(T 0) + ω0(T, T 0)(cid:17) + X

T 0∈P1

T 0∈P2

= ϕ0(P1 ∪ P2, T) = ϕ0(P1, T) + ϕ0(P2, T).

5.3 Commutation between σ, E, ϕ0
Proposition 5.12. Let P be a simply connected patch of σ∞(C) and T a tile. We have

ϕ0 ◦ ˆσ(P, T) = E ◦ ϕ0(P, T).

In the previous formula, we formally consider that the map E acts on multisets.

Proof. A direct veriﬁcation shows that for every tile T in σ∞(C), we have

ϕ0 ◦ ˆσ(T, T) = E ◦ ϕ0(T, T),

We now establish the relation (5.2) when P is a tile T 0. Let T, T 0 be tiles of σ∞(C). Recall that,
by deﬁnition of the pointed substitution ˆσ, we have ˆσ(T 0, T) = (σ(T 0), b(T)). By Lemma 5.10
and Proposition 5.7, we have

ϕ0(σ(T 0), b(T)) = ϕ0(σ(T 0), b(T 0)) + ω0(b(T), b(T 0))

= ϕ0(ˆσ(T 0, T 0)) + M−1

s ω0(T, T 0).

Using relation (5.3) and Equation 3.1, we get that:

ϕ0(ˆσ(T 0, T)) = E(ϕ0(T 0, T 0)) + M−1

s ω0(T, T 0)

= E(ϕ0(T 0, T 0) + ω0(T, T 0)).

Using again Lemma 5.10, we get:

(5.4)
We now prove the relation (5.2) in full generality. Let P be a patch in σ∞(C) and let T be a

5.4 From σ∞(C) to Σstep
5.4.1 The map induced by ϕ0
Proposition 5.12 implies that for every integer n,

ϕ0 ◦ ˆσn(C, C) = En ◦ ϕ0(C, C) = En(U).

Since En(U) converges to the stepped surface Σstep = S

In what follows, it is convenient to identify a multiset and its support as explained in Remark 3.1.
n∈N En(U) (see Proposition 3.3) and
since σn(C) converges to σ∞(C), the map ϕ0 induces a map, still denoted by ϕ0 such that:

• for every tile T of σ∞(C), ϕ0(T, C) is a subset of Σstep,
• Σstep =

ϕ0(T, C).

T tile of σ∞(C)

Lemma 5.13. For every tile T of σ∞(C), there exists a unique facet [x, i]∗ in Σstep such that

ϕ0(T, C) = E3([x, i]∗).

Proof. First, we recall that Lemma 3 of [AI01] states that the map E is “injective”: precisely,
if E([x, i]∗) and E([x0, i0]∗) have a facet in common, then x = x0 and i = i0. This provides the
unicity of the facet [x, i]∗ in the lemma (if it exists).
that ϕ0(T, C) = E3([0, i]∗) + ui + ω0(T, C) with

We know that ϕ0(T, C) = Φ(T) + ω0(T, C). By deﬁnition of Φ, there exists an integer i such

u1 = e3 − e1 = M−3

s (−2e1 − e2), u2 = e2 − e1 = M−3

s (−e1), u3 = 0.

That is to say:

ϕ0(T, C) = E3([x, i]∗) with x = M3

s(ω0(T, c) + ui).

We claim that [x, i]∗ lies in Σstep. Indeed since Σstep = E3(Σstep), we know that there exists
facets of Σstep which images by E3 cover ϕ0(T, C). By Lemma 3 of [AI01] again, we conclude
that the facet [x, i]∗ is lying in Σstep.

5.4.2 The map Ψ
We are now in position to deﬁne a bijection Ψ from the set of tiles of σ∞(C) to the set of facets
of Σstep:

Ψ(T) = [x, i]∗, where ϕ0(T) = E3([x, i]∗).

Moreover, since Φ(C) = E3([0, 1]∗), Φ(B) = E3([0, 2]∗) and Φ(A) = E3([0, 3]∗), we see that

type(T) = A ⇔ type(Ψ(T)) = 3,
type(T) = B ⇔ type(Ψ(T)) = 2,
type(T) = C ⇔ type(Ψ(T)) = 1.

We set θ(A) = 3, θ(B) = 2, θ(C) = 1. We summarize the previous discussion in the following

Ψ(T) = [M3

proposition:
Theorem 5.14. The map Ψ deﬁned, for every tile T of σ∞(C), by:
s(ω0(T, C) + utype(T )), θ(type(T))]∗
is a bijection from the set of tiles of σ∞(C) to the set of facets of Σstep.
5.5 Link between two tilings Ttop and Tstep
5.5.1 Theorem 5.14 revisited
We recall that, according to Proposition 4.6, σ∞(C) can be realized as the tiling Ttop, and
according to Proposition 3.3 the tiling Tstep is the “image” of the stepped surface Σstep by the
projection πβ : Σstep → P. Hence, Theorem 5.14 explains exactly how the two tilings Ttop and
Tstep are related. In particular:

• The map Ψ sends tiles of the same type to tiles of the same type.
• In Ttop, the way to locate a tile T with respect to another tile T 0, via the identiﬁcation
with σ∞(C), is by using the “address” ω0(T, T 0). In Tstep, the corresponding tiles Ψ(T)
and Ψ(T 0) then will diﬀer from the vector πβ(ω0(T, T 0)).

22

5.5.2 Via the Delone set D = ∪i∈{1,2,3}Di
We would like to explicit the link between Ttop and Tstep in the same spirit of what we explain
in Remark 3.6 and Remark 3.4. For that, we ﬁrst notice that, alternatively, σ∞(C) can be
geometrized as follow. According to Lemma 5.13, the set {πβ(ϕ0(T, C)) | T tile of σ∞(C)} tiles
the plane P, and the resulting tiling is a geometric realization of σ∞(C). The deﬁnition of Ψ
in Section 5.2 gives us a base point in Φ(A), Φ(B) and Φ(C), and consequently, gives rise to
a base point xT in each ϕ0(T, C). The set {πβ(xT ) | T tile of σ∞(C)} is a Delone set in P.
However, it is not equal to the set D of Remark 3.4: indeed, it is equal to M−3
s D, see the proof
of Lemma 5.13.

This leads us to do what follows. For each tile T of σ∞(C), we consider

Tgeo = πβ(M3

s(ϕ0(T, C))) ⊂ P.

The set {Tgeo | T tile of σ∞(C)} tiles the plane P. This tilling is again a geometric realization
of σ∞(C), and we denote it by T 0

of Tgeo with θ(type(T)) = i) at each vector in Di. This explicits the strong relation between the
two tilings T 0

5.5.3 The map Ψ as a “two-dimensional sliding block code”
It is worth to remark that, by deﬁnition of Ψ, and because the addressing map ω0 is additive,
there is an elementary way to rebuild Tstep from Ttop just by looking at local conﬁgurations of
tiles. We give in Figure 11 all the information needed for doing that.

Figure 11: Ψ and Ψ−1 as a two-dimensional sliding block code.

In practice, to construct Tstep from Ttop, we can ignore the formula of Theorem 5.14 and
simply use the recipe given in Figure 11. We choose a tile T in Ttop, and put in the plane a tile
of Tstep of same type as T. Then we choose a tile T 0 adjacent to T and use Figure 11 to place
correctly the corresponding tile Ψ(T 0) relatively to Ψ(T). And we go on, inductively rebuilding
Tstep.

23

This can also be done to deﬁne Ψ−1, see Figure 11.
This point of view on Ψ remind us of the so-called sliding block code in classical symbolic
dynamics, see for instance [LM95]. In that spirit, ψ could be called a two-dimensional sliding
block code.

6 Generalization and comments
Towards more general results The results presented in this article are speciﬁcally about
the tilings associated with the Tribonacci substitution and its associated Rauzy fractal tilings.
We have been able to get such results for some other examples of Pisot substitutions, such as the
one shown in Figure 12.

1(t) to “inﬂate” the tiles from single facets to patches of
facets (metatiles). This is shown in Figure 13 (center), where each metatile has the same
color as its single-facet preimage. We must iterate E∗
1(t) suﬃciently many times (3 times in
this case), so that every intersection between two tiles is either empty or consists of edges
(single points are not allowed).

3. Iterate E∗

1(t) one more time to “read” how the metatiles should be substituted. This is

where we extract the information to deﬁne the topological substitution τ in two steps:

other metatiles, or a union of two metatiles:

(b) We deﬁne the boundaries’ images by comparing the common edges between two
adjacent metatiles and the common edges between their images in Figure 13 (center

The method described above is not guaranteed to work in general for an arbitrary dual substitution.
The main problem is that in many cases, the topology of the patterns produced by the dual
substitution can be complicated (disconnected, for example). This can cause Step 2 above to fail.
This is linked with some diﬃcult dynamical and combinatorial questions about substitutions (see
the next paragraph).

Links with dynamics of substitutions
It is interesting to remark that being able to ﬁnd
such a topological substitution has some implications on the dynamics of the underlying Pisot
symbolic substitution. Indeed, it can be proved that the underlying Pisot substitution has pure
discrete spectrum if and only if the patterns generated by its associated dual substitution contain
arbitrarily large balls [BR10]. This property is diﬃcult to check for dual substitutions, but easy
to check for topological substitutions (see the core property in Section 4).

This is linked to an important topic in substitution dynamics. There are many equivalent
statements of the pure discrete spectrum property and they attract a lot of interest, notably in
the context of the Pisot conjecture [ABB+15].
