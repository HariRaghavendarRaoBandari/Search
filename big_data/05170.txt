REDUCTION RELATIONS BETWEEN NON-COLLAPSED AB

INITIO HRUSHOVSKI CONSTRUCTIONS OF VARYING

DEGREES OF SYMMETRY

OMER MERMELSTEIN

Abstract. Denote Hrushovski’s non-collapsed ab initio construction for an
n-ary relation by M and the analogous construction for a symmetric n-ary
relation by M∼. We show that M is isomorphic to a proper reduct of M∼
and vice versa, and that the combinatorial geometries associated with both
structures are isomorphic.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background. The source of pregeometries in model theory is the closure
operation on realizations of a regular type, given by forking. The best known
example of this, is the algebraic closure operation on a strongly minimal set. In
the early 1980s Boris Zil’ber conjectured that, after naming some parameters, the
geometry of a strongly minimal set is isomorphic to that of a set, that of a vector
space or that of an algebraically closed ﬁeld1. This conjecture was refuted by a
construction introduced by Ehud Hrushovski in [7], referred to as Hrushovski’s ab
initio construction.

Hrushovski’s ab initio construction is a Fra¨ıss´e limit featuring a regular type
whose forking geometry is non-trivial, yet disallowing the existence of a deﬁnable
group. By imposing restrictions on the class from which the limit is constructed, one
allows only ﬁnitely many realizations of any forking extension - hence producing a
strongly minimal structure not within Zil’ber’s classiﬁcation. However, lifting these
restrictions on the class produces an ω-stable limit of Morley rank ω, whose unique
type of rank ω is regular and of the same geometrical ﬂavour. The ω-stable version
of the construction is often referred to as the non-collapsed version in opposition
to the collapsed strongly minimal version.

The innovative component of the construction, and the one that produces the
desired geometry in the limit, is a combinatorial predimension function deﬁned on
the amalgamation class used, which determines the dimension function of the non-
forking geometry of the limit. This idea has been used since then to construct many
structures of a similar ﬂavour. The purpose of this paper, is to initiate discussion
regarding reduction (in the sense of reducts) relations between Hrushovski-esque
constructions.

This paper was written under the supervision of Dr. Assaf Hasson as part of the author’s PhD
candidacy at the Department of Mathematics at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. The author
was partially supported by The Israel Science Foundation grant number 1156/10.

1 This formulation is not the full conjecture, omitting the existence of deﬁnable algebraic

structures in the strongly minimal set.

Although we will not touch upon them further, in order to get a clear picture of
the strongly minimal structures we know, Hrushovski fusions must be mentioned.
In [6], Hrushovski proved that for T1, T2, strongly minimal theories in disjoint lan-
guages L1, L2 with DMP (a minor technical requirement), there exists a strongly
minimal theory T such that its restriction to Li is exactly Ti. The construction
itself is technically similar to the ab initio constructions. These fusion constructions
further muddle any eﬀort to classify strongly minimal structures by their geometry.
However, already in [6] Hrushovski suggests that the geometry of the fusion struc-
ture is “relatively ﬂat” over T1 and T2. Naively speaking, algebraic complexity in
the fusion must stem from algebraic complexity in the components, and is restricted
by the degree of complexity of the components.

1.2. Motivation. Unlike the “classic” strongly minimal structures from Zil’ber’s
suggested classiﬁcation, which are encountered in all of mathematics, Hrushovski’s
constructions remain without an obvious classical template. This is in contrast
to the common perception that strongly minimal structures are the most clearly
structured and well-behaved. This leaves the curious with two options: either there
is a distinct split amongst strongly minimal structures – those with geometries
stemming purely from algebraic structure, and the rest – and a separate set of
rules governing each kind, or there is some unifying theory of strongly minimal
geometries which we have not yet pinpointed. In either case, as the only examples
of non-classic geometries we know are Hrushovski constructions and fusions, and
from these, the ab initio constructions are the simplest, it stands to reason to begin
our exploration with them.

We are already aware of strong ties between a structure’s geometry and what it
must interpret in the “classic” non-trivial cases. In the case of a set of realizations
of a regular type with locally modular geometry, Hrushovski proved in [5] that
it must interpret a vector space over a prime ﬁeld.
In the case of a reduct of
an algebraically closed ﬁeld, by work of Rabinovich [10], if the reduct’s geometry
is not locally modular, then it interprets an inﬁnite ﬁeld isomorphic to the one it
originated from (this was recently strengthened by Hasson and Sustretov to reducts
of a curve over an algebraically closed ﬁeld, rather than of the ﬁeld itself). We are
still in the dark in the case of the ab initio constructions, but would like to ﬁnd out
whether there is some analogue. Perhaps also here, the geometry exercises some
control over what the structure must interpret.

With the hope of shedding some light on what would be reasonable to conjecture,
we begin the ﬁrst leg of our journey with studying interpretability in ab initio
constructions and, as a ﬁrst step, restrict ourselves to reducts. As the collapsed
and non-collapsed versions of the ab initio structures are similar in construction
and geometry [3], and the non-collapsed version is signiﬁcantly better behaved, it
has become common practice to ask questions and look for answers in the non-
collapsed construction. For intimate knowledge of the intricacies of the collapsed
construction, we dare not deviate from this practice, and postpone the treatment
of the collapsed case until some concrete knowledge of the behaviour of reducts in
the non-collapsed case has been obtained.

Another (tangential) reason to examine reducts of ab initio constructions is that
the similarly constructed Hrushovski fusion constructions, as described above, are
characterized by the fact that each of the components of the fusion is a reduct of the
outcome structure. Although we do not expect such a thing, some of the methods

REDUCTS BETWEEN NON-COLLPASED HRUSHOVSKI CONSTRUCTIONS

3

produced in order to tackle reduction in ab initio constructions may be transferable
to fusions. Such a development may assist in recognizing a structure as a fusion by
its model theoretic properties, rather than some a-priori knowledge. A recognition
of fusions, in turn, immediately rekindles a Zil’ber-like classiﬁcation of non-fusion
strongly minimal geometry types. To the author’s best knowledge, model theoretic
criteria for being a fusion is still completely in the dark.

1.3. Structure and main results. It is the opinion of many that there is a lack
of recent gateway material into Hrushovski constructions, rendering it a ﬁeld of
experts. Although expertise is indeed a necessity when discussing regular types
and geometries in the abstract, Hrushovski constructions can be seen as purely
combinatorial creatures, accessible to a general mathematical audience. The ﬁrst
half of this text aspires to be such a gateway text.

The paper begins with a soft, fully detailed introduction to combinatorial geome-
tries and Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski (FH for short) amalgamation classes, in the second and
third sections. Albeit most components of the introduction are standard, subsec-
tions 3.5 and 3.6 are noteworthy. Subsection 3.5 is the toolbox we use to prove
isomorphism of geometries of FH limits, roughly as used in [2], [3]. Subsection
3.6 is original, and provides explicit means for showing that one FH limit is the
(proper) reduct of another FH limit, where both are of the ”non-collapsed nature”
which we call simple (Deﬁnitions 3.3.1, 3.3.3)

In order to properly state results, we must ﬁrst recall that Hrushovski’s ab initio
construction from [7] is in the language of a ternary relation R and consisting
of a countable structure such that any of its ﬁnite substructures has at most as
many triples related by R as it does points.
In Section 4 we diverge from the
generality of the ﬁrst part of the paper, and present the non-collapsed variation of
Hrushovski’s construction, with varying degrees of symmetry and of arbitrary arity:
ﬁxing arity n, for every g ≤ Sn we construct a structure Mg and distinguish two of
these – Hrushovski’s construction not admitting any inherent symmetry M6∼, and
Hrushovski’s construction admitting full symmetry M∼. For clarity, when referring
to an arbitrary ab initio construction in this introduction, we mean one of these
Mg. The section is concluded with
Theorem (4.2.10). The pregeometry associated with M6∼ is isomorphic to the pre-
geometry associated with Mg, for every g ≤ Sn.

proving that, for arity n, the level of symmetry has no eﬀect on the geometry
of the structure. Note that, as proved by Evans and Ferreira in [2], the geometry
does change with n.

Section 5 is a technical voyage, aimed at using the tools developed in Subsection

3.6, and culminating in the main result of this paper:

Corollary (5.4.6). For any g, h ≤ Sn, the structure Mg is isomorphic to a proper
reduct of Mh.

The theorem, while seemingly not a signiﬁcant advancement beyond a proof-of-
concept of reduction between FH limits, is actually quite useful from a technical
point of view for our future endeavors. When attempting to prove or deny the
existence of a reduct with a certain property, one may choose the level of symmetry
with which to work. For example in [9], where a given FH limit Ms is shown to be
isomorphic to the reduct of M∼ to a certain formula ϕs, much of the eﬀort revolves

4

OMER MERMELSTEIN

around making sure no “unintentional” realizations of ϕs are introduced due to the
symmetry of the structure. When looking at the reduct given by the same formula
ϕs in M6∼, the complexity is nulliﬁed, and only straightforward inquiry is required
in order to show that the reduct received is indeed Ms. By our result, it is enough
to examine M6∼ in order to conclude that Ms is a reduct of M6∼.

Also, in addition to the discovery that M6∼ is a proper reduct of M∼ and not only
the other way around, an immediate consequence is that for arity greater than 2,
there is an inﬁnite descending chain of proper reducts with non-trivial geometries,
beginning with M6∼. From this, we get the (weaker) result that there is a strictly
ascending chain of closed subgroups of S∞ beginning with the automorphism group
of any Mg. Although not answering any speciﬁc asked question, this result is in
spirit with recent exploration of group-reducts of Hrushovski constructions. In an
unpublished work Ghadernezhad [4] explores the number of group-reducts of various
Hrushovski constructions, and in [8] Kaplan and Simon ask whether the automor-
phism group of the geometry of a speciﬁc Hrushovski construction is maximal.

1.4. Further questions. At this point, two separate directions of investigation
present themselves.

Firstly, although stated as some of our motivation, the question of whether
geometries of ab initio constructions enforce interpretability of a certain structure
is left unanswered. So it still remains to ﬁnd out if, for example, every reduct of an
ab initio construction with a non-trivial geometry interprets a non-trivial ab initio
construction. This in turn leads to the question of what non-trivial geometries can
be associated to reducts of M∼. By our result we already know that there are
inﬁnitely many reducts with a geometry isomorphic to that of M∼, but a question
asked by Evans still remains open
Question. For arity n = 3, is there a reduct of M∼ whose geometry is non-trivial
and not isomorphic to the geometry of M∼?

Evans showed in [1] that M∼ itself is a reduct of a stable one-based FH limit with
a trivial geometry, so a rise in “complexity” of geometries when taking a reduct
of an FH limit is not unheard of. It is expected that if such a reduct exists, its
geometry will be that of an ab initio construction of a larger arity – but even that
is not clear.

Secondly, we must check whether our result transfers to the collapsed case. Upon
inspection, the methods used in this paper are dependant on the FH limits being of
the non-collapsed ﬂavour and clearly fail for the collapsed case. Thus, it still remains
to develop a toolbox appropriate for the collapsed constructions and ﬁnd out: If we
attempt to ‘symmetrize’ a collapsed ab initio construction, do we necessarily get a
proper reduct? Can we ﬁnd an inﬁnite descending chain of proper reducts with a
non-trivial geometry in a collapsed construction?

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Notation and conventions. The following are several conventions we use
throughout the text.

Sets.

• Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the letters A, B, C, D . . . will denote ﬁnite sets

and the letters M, N, P . . . will denote possibly inﬁnite sets.

REDUCTS BETWEEN NON-COLLPASED HRUSHOVSKI CONSTRUCTIONS

5

• We denote by P(X) the set of subsets of X and by Fin(X) the set of ﬁnite

subsets of X.

• Let A, B be sets (possibly inﬁnite) and c, d points. We may, when there is
no confusion, omit the union operator and set notation and denote Ac =
A ∪ {c}, cBd = B ∪ {c, d}, ABc = A ∪ B ∪ {c}, cd = {c, d}, and so on.

First order structures.

• Languages are always assumed to be relational and countable. Structures

are also always assumed to be countable.

• Let M be a ﬁrst order structure in a relational language L. We deﬁne
age(M) to be the collection of all ﬁnite L-structures that are isomorphic
to some substructure of M.

• For a structure M with universe M , since we assume languages to be rela-
tional, a subset N ⊆ M may be identiﬁed with N , the unique substructure
of M with universe N . Write N M to mean this substructure N .

Functions deﬁned on structures.

• Let M be a structure in a language L and let R ∈ L be some n-ary relation
symbol. We write R(M) to mean the interpretation of R in M, instead of
the more traditional RM. Explicitly, R(M) = {¯a ∈ M n | M |= R(¯a)}.
We introduce some shorthand:

– If N ⊆ M we write R(M/N ) to mean R(M) \ R(N ).
– If N ⊆ M we write RM(N ) to mean R(N M).
– If P ⊆ N ⊆ M , we write RM(N/P ) to mean R(N M/P M).

• Let A be a ﬁnite structure. We denote |A| = |A|.
• Let M be a structure. For A ∈ Fin(M ) and a function δ0 deﬁned on

age(M), we write δM

0 (A) to mean δ0(A) where A = AM.

• Let M be a structure with a function δ0 deﬁned on age(M). Let A, B ∈

Fin(M ), then we denote δM

0 (B/A) = δM

0 (B ∪ A) − δM

0 (A).

Expansions and reducts.

• Let L1 ⊆ L2 and let M be an L1-structure. Say an L2-structure M′ is an
expansion of M if it has universe M and R(M′) = R(M) for all R ∈ L1.
Say M′ is a deﬁnable expansion of M if for each R ∈ L2 there is an
L1-formula (with parameters) ϕR(¯x) such that M′ |= ∀¯x(R(¯x) ↔ ϕR(¯x)).
• In this paper, deﬁne a reduct as follows: An L1-structure M is a reduct of
an L2-structure M′, if there exists an L1 ∪ L2-structure M′′, a deﬁnable
expansion of M′ that is also an expansion of M. Note that such a structure
M′′ is unique. We say M is a proper reduct of M′, if M′′ is not a deﬁnable
expansion of M.

If L1 ⊆ L2 then M is uniquely determined by M′ and L1 and so we

write M′ ↾ L1 to mean M, and refer to M as the reduct of M′ to L1.

2.2. Pregeometries. The contents of this subsection are a standard and well
known treatment of pregeometries.

Basic deﬁnitions. Let X be a set and let cl : P(X) → P(X). We say (X, cl) is a
pregeometry if for all Y, Z ⊆ X:

(1) Y ⊆ cl(Y ).
(2) If Y ⊆ Z then cl(Y ) ⊆ cl(Z).

6

OMER MERMELSTEIN

(3) cl(cl(Y )) = cl(Y ).
(4) (Finite nature) If a ∈ cl(Y ) then there is some ﬁnite Y0 ⊆ Y such that

a ∈ cl(Y0).

(5) (Exchange principle) If a ∈ cl(Y b) \ cl(Y ) then b ∈ cl(Y a).

We say Y ⊆ X is independent if a /∈ cl(Y \ {a}) for any a ∈ Y . For Z ⊆ X we say
Y ⊆ Z is a basis for Z if Y is independent and Z ⊆ cl(Y ).
Any Z ⊆ X has a basis and it follows from the exchange principle that if Y1 and
Y2 are bases for Z, then |Y1| = |Y2|.
For Z ⊆ X we deﬁne dim(Z), the dimension of Z to be the cardinality of a basis
for Z.

Proposition 2.2.1.

i. A pregeometry (X, cl) is uniquely determined by the col-

lection of ﬁnite independent subsets of X

ii. A pregeometry (X, cl) is uniquely determined by the restriction of its dimension

function to Fin(X).

Proof.

i. Let Z ⊆ X and let Y be a basis for Z. Then x ∈ cl(Z) if and only if
x ∈ cl(Y ) if and only if there exists some ﬁnite Y0 ⊆ Y such that x ∈ cl(Y0).
Thus, x ∈ cl(Z) if and only if there is a ﬁnite set Y0 ⊆ Z such that Y0 is
independent but Y0 ∪ {x} is not independent.

ii. A ﬁnite set Y is independent if and only if |Y | = dim(Y ).

(cid:3)

Let (X1, cl1) and (X2, cl2) be pregeometries with dimension functions d1 and
d2 respectively. We say that they they are isomorphic if there exists a bijection
f : X1 → X2 such that cl1(Y ) = cl2(f [Y ]) for all Y ∈ P(X1). By Proposition 2.2.1,
this is equivalent to d1(Y ) = d2(f [Y ]) for all Y ∈ Fin(X).

Deﬁning a pregeometry from a function.

Deﬁnition 2.2.2. Let d : Fin(X) → N. We say that d deﬁnes a pregeometry on
X if for all Y, Z ∈ Fin(X) and a ∈ X:

I. d(∅) = 0.
II. d(Y ) ≤ d(Y a) ≤ d(Y ) + 1.
III. (Submodularity) d(Y ∪ Z) ≤ d(Y ) + d(Z) − d(Y ∩ Z).

Proposition 2.2.3. Let d : Fin(X) → N be such that it deﬁnes a pregeometry
on X. Then there exists a unique pregeometry (X, cld) whose dimension function
restricted to Fin(X) is d. For any Y ∈ Fin(X) the operator cld is deﬁned

cld(Y ) = {a ∈ X | d(Y a) = d(A)}

(cid:3)

Proof. We deﬁne an operator cld : P(X) → P(X) and prove that it induces a
pregeometry on X.
For Y ⊆ X ﬁnite deﬁne:

cld(Y ) = {a ∈ X | d(Y a) = d(A)}

If Z is ﬁnite and Y ⊆ Z such that a ∈ cld(Y ), then by submodularity d(Za) ≤
d(Z) + d(Y a) − d(Y ) = d(Z). Since also d(Z) ≤ d(Za), we have equality and

REDUCTS BETWEEN NON-COLLPASED HRUSHOVSKI CONSTRUCTIONS

7

therefore a ∈ cld(Z). So for ﬁnite Z ⊆ X we have cld(Y ) ⊆ cld(Z) for any Y ⊆ Z.
Thus, we may extend our deﬁnition of cld to any Y ⊆ X:

cld(Y ) = [

cld(Y0)

We prove that (X, cl) satisﬁes properties 1 − 5:

Y0∈Fin(Y )

(1) For every ﬁnite Y0 ⊆ Y we have Y0 ⊆ cld(Y0) ⊆ cld(Y ) and so Y ⊆ cld(Y ).
(2) Assume Y ⊆ Z. Let a ∈ cld(Y ), then there is some Y0 ∈ Fin(Y ) with
a ∈ cld(Y0). Since Y ⊆ Z, Y0 ∈ Fin(Z) and so a ∈ cld(Y0) ⊆ cld(Z). So
cld(Y ) ⊆ cld(Z).

(3) By 1 we know Y ⊆ cld(Y ) and so by 2, cld(Y ) ⊆ cld(cld(Y )). Now, as-
sume a ∈ cld(cld(Y )), then there is some ﬁnite set A0 = {a1, . . . , an} in
Fin(cld(Y )) with a ∈ cld(A0). Since A0 ⊆ cld(Y ), for each i ∈ {1, . . . , n}
there is some Y i
0 ). De-
note Y0 = Sn
0 . We assume for clarity that ai /∈ Y0 for all i ∈ {1, . . . , n}
and note that this is no loss of generality for the purpose of the following
calculation. We calculate by iterating submodularity:

0 ∈ Fin(Y ) with ai ∈ cld(Y i

i=1 Y i

0 ), meaning d(Y i

0 ai) = d(Y i

d(Y0A0) =

d(Y0a1 . . . an) ≤ d(Y0a1 . . . an−1) + d(Y n

0 an) − d(Y n

0 ) =

d(Y0a1 . . . an−1) ≤ d(Y0a1 . . . an−2) + d(Y n−1

an−1) − d(Y n−1

0

) =

. . .

d(Y0a1) ≤ d(Y0) + d(Y 1

0 a1) − d(Y 1

0 ) = d(Y0)

So d(Y0A0) ≤ d(Y0) and therefore d(Y0A0) = d(Y0) by monotonicity of d
(by II). As we also know d(A0a) = d(A0), we may use submodularity once
more, assuming a /∈ Y0 for clarity as before, and receive

d(Y0A0a) ≤ d(Y0A0) + d(A0a) − d(A0)

= d(Y0A0) = d(Y0)

By the above and the monotonicity of d we have d(Y0A0a) = d(Y0). Another
application of monotonicity yields d(Y0a) ≤ d(Y0A0a) and so ﬁnally

d(Y0a) ≤ d(Y0A0a) = d(Y0)

and thus d(Y0a) = d(Y0). Therefore, by deﬁnition, a ∈ cld(Y0) ⊆ cld(Y ),
and so cld(cld(Y )) ⊆ cld(Y ).

In conclusion cld(Y ) = cld(cld(Y )).
(4) Immediate from the deﬁnition of cld.
(5) Assume a ∈ cld(Y b) \ cld(Y ). If b ∈ cld(Y ) then a ∈ cld(cld(Y )) = cld(Y ) in
contradiction to our choice of a, so this cannot happen. Since a ∈ cld(Y b),
there is some Y0 ∈ Fin(Y ) such that a ∈ cld(Y0b), so d(Y0ab) = d(Y0b). In
addition, a, b /∈ cld(Y0) and in particular d(Y0a) = d(Y0b) = d(Y0) + 1 (by
II). Thus, d(Y0ab) = d(Y0b) = d(Y0a) and so b ∈ cld(Y0a) ⊆ cld(Y a).

We have proved that (X, cl) is indeed a pregeometry, denote its dimension
function by dim. To conclude, we must prove that for all Y ∈ Fin(X) we have
dim(Y ) = d(Y ).
We ﬁrst show by induction that this is true if Y is independent. Let dim(Y ) =
|Y | = n + 1. Choose some a ∈ Y , then Y \ {a} is independent with |Y \ {a}| = n

8

OMER MERMELSTEIN

and so by the induction hypothesis d(Y \ {a}) = n. By the fact Y is independent
we have a /∈ cld(Y \ {a}) and so d(Y ) = d(Y \ {a}) + 1 = n + 1.
Now, let Y ∈ Fin(X) be general. Fix an enumeration Y = {a1, . . . , an} and denote
A0 = ∅, Ai+1 = Ai ∪ {ai+1}. Fix Y0 ⊆ Y , a basis of Y , then for any i ∈ {1, . . . , n}
we have ai ∈ cld(Y0). By monotonicity of the closure (property 2), this gives us
ai+1 ∈ cld(Y0Ai), meaning d(Y0Ai+1) = d(Y0Ai), for any i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1}. Thus,
d(Y ) = d(Y0An) = d(Y0A0) = d(Y0). Since Y0 is independent and is a basis of Y ,
we have d(Y0) = |Y0| = dim(Y ).
(cid:3)

The associated geometry. We say (X, cl) is a geometry if (X, cl) is a pregeom-
etry and in addition:

(1) cl(∅) = ∅.
(2) cl({x}) = {x} for any x ∈ X.

If (X, cl) is a pregeometry, then it has an associated geometry: Deﬁne a relation
∼ on X0 = X \ cl(∅) so that a ∼ b if and only if b ∈ cl({a}). By the exchange
principle and closure properties of (X, cl), the relation ∼ is an equivalence relation.

Deﬁne eX = X0/ ∼ and for Y ⊆ eX deﬁne cl∼(Y ) = {[x]∼ ∈ eX | x ∈ cl(S Y )}. It
is easy to verify that this deﬁnes a geometry. The geometry ( eX, cl∼) is called the

geometry associated with (X, cl).

In addition, dim∼, the dimension function of the associated geometry, is given by
dim, the pregeometry’s dimension function, and vice versa.

For eY ⊆ eX:

For Y ⊆ X:

dim∼(eY ) = dim([ eY )

dim(Y ) = dim∼({[y]∼ | y ∈ Y \ cl(∅)})

Observation 2.2.4. If (X, clX ) and (Y, clY ) are pregeometries such that all their
equivalence classes under the relation ∼ are of the same cardinality (for example
countably inﬁnite) and | clX (∅)| = | clY (∅)| then they are isomorphic if and only if
their associated geometries are isomorphic.

3. Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amalgamation classes

Unlike in the case of a Fra¨ıss´e construction, there is no precise, agreed upon deﬁ-
nition for a Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amalgamation class and its associated construction.
The notion of a Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amalgamation class introduced here is given in
a simple setting which suits the purpose of this work, and may be generalized in
several ways.
Fix L, a countable relational language and ﬁx C0, a class of ﬁnite L-structures such
that:

(1) If A ∈ C0 and A ∼= B then B ∈ C0.
(2) If A ∈ C0 and B ⊆ A then B ∈ C0
(3) The structures of C0 have at most countably many isomorphism types. (i.e:
i=1 ⊆ C0 such that for any A ∈ C0 there

There is a countable family {Ai}∞
exists some i with A ∼= Ai)

3.1. Predimension.

Deﬁnition 3.1.1. We say δ0 : C0 → Z is a predimension function on C0 if it has
the following properties:

(1) δ0(∅) = 0.
(2) If A ∈ C0 with universe A then δ0(A) ≤ |A|.
(3) If A ∈ C0 and A ∼= B then δ0(A) = δ0(B).
(4) If D ∈ C0 and A, B ⊆ D then δD

0 (A ∪ B) ≤ δD

0 (A) + δD

0 (B) − δD

0 (A ∩ B).

(Submodularity)

Fix δ0 : C0 → Z, a predimension function on C0. For any M with age(M) ⊆ C0
we deﬁne a function δM : Fin(M ) → Z ∪ {−∞} such that for A ∈ Fin(M )

δM(A) = min {δM

0 (B) | B ∈ Fin(M ), A ⊆ B ⊆ M }

We call δM the dimension function associated with δM
0 .
Let C be the subclass of C0 whose elements are all the structures A ∈ C0 such that
δA(∅) = 0, or synonymously, the structures for which δA is non-negative. Take
note that C also is closed under isomorphism and under taking sub-structures, and
that there are only countably many isomorphism types in C.
Proposition 3.1.2. Let M be an L-structure with age(M) ⊆ C. Then the function
δM : Fin(M ) → N deﬁnes a pregeometry on M .

Proof. We only need to show that δM has the properties speciﬁed in Deﬁnition
2.2.2.

I. Clearly δM(∅) ≥ 0 and also δM(∅) ≤ δM
II. Let A ∈ Fin(M ) and a ∈ M . By deﬁnition, δM(A) ≤ δM(Aa). Now, choose
0 (B) = δM(A). By deﬁnition, since
0 (B) +
0 (Ba) = δM(A). In any case, this gives

some B ∈ Fin(M ) with A ⊆ B and δM
Aa ⊆ Ba we have δM(Aa) ≤ δM
0 (a) ≤ δM(A) + 1, and otherwise δM
δM
us δM(Aa) ≤ δM(A) + 1.

0 (∅) ≤ |∅| = 0. So δM(∅) = 0.

0 (Ba). If a /∈ B then δM

0 (Ba) ≤ δM

III. Let A, B ∈ Fin(M ). Choose some A ⊆ ¯A ∈ Fin(M ) such that δM

0 ( ¯A) =
0 ( ¯B) = δM(B). Then A∪B ⊆ ¯A∪ ¯B
0 ( ¯A ∪ ¯B), and also A ∩ B ⊆ ¯A ∩ ¯B, so

δM(A) and B ⊆ ¯B ∈ Fin(M ) such that δM
and in particular δM(A ∪ B) ≤ δM
δM(A ∩ B) ≤ δM

0 ( ¯A ∩ ¯B). Thus we have

δM(A ∪ B) ≤ δM
0 ( ¯A ∩ ¯B)

0 ( ¯A ∪ ¯B)

For M with age(M) ⊆ C0 and N ∈ P(M ), say that the d-closure of N in M is

N = [

A∈Fin(N )

{a ∈ M | δM(Aa) = δM(A)}

Say that N is d-closed in M if N is its own d-closure in M.
If age(M) ⊆ C as in the above proposition, the d-closure in M of a set N ∈ P(M )
is just the closure of N in the pregeometry deﬁned by δM.

3.2. Self-suﬃciency. In this subsection we denote by M a general L-structure
with age(M) ⊆ C0.
For a ﬁnite substructure A ⊆ M we say that A is self-suﬃcient in M and denote
A 6 M if δM(A) = δM
For A ∈ Fin(M ) and N ∈ P(M ) we write A 6M N to mean A 6 N where A = AM
and N = N M. We abuse notation and write A 6 M for A 6M M .
It is important to note that for us A 6 M implies A ⊆ M. In addition, A 6M N
implies that A, N ⊆ M .
Observation. Recall the notation δM
this notation to restate the submodularity of δM
0 :

0 (A). We may use

0 (A ∪ B) − δM

0 (B/A) = δM

• For any B1, B2 ∈ Fin(M ) with B1 ∩ B2 = A we have δM

0 (B2/B1) ≤

δM
0 (B2/A)

and give an equivalent deﬁnition for self-suﬃciency:

• For A ∈ Fin(M ) and N ∈ P(M ), A 6M N if and only if A ⊆ N and

δM
0 (B/A) ≥ 0 for all B ∈ Fin(N ).

0 (X/X ∩ A) ≥ 0 for any X ∈ Fin(M ).

0 (X/A) ≤ δM

Lemma 3.2.1. If A 6 M then δM
Proof. By submodularity we have δM
0 (X/A) ≥ 0. Combining the two gives δM
δM
Corollary 3.2.2. If A 6 M then δM ↾ Fin(A) = δA.
Proof. Let Y ∈ Fin(A). Let X ∈ Fin(M ) such that Y ⊆ X and δM
By the above lemma, δM
Y ⊆ X ∩ A so δA(Y ) ≤ δM(Y ). By deﬁnition, δM(Y ) ≤ δA(Y ).

0 (X ∩ A) ≤ δM

0 (X/X ∩ A) ≥ 0.

0 (X). But, δA

0 (X ∩ A) = δM

0 (X/X ∩ A). By A 6 M we have
(cid:3)

0 (X) = δM(Y ).
0 (X ∩ A) and
(cid:3)

Proposition 3.2.3. The relation 6 is transitive.
Proof. Let A 6 B and B 6 M. By the above corollary, δM ↾ Fin(B) = δB. So we
have δM(A) = δB(A) and by deﬁnition δM
0 (A) = δB(A). In particular,
δM(A) = δM
(cid:3)

0 (A) = δB

0 (A) and A 6 M.

Lemma 3.2.4. If A 6 M and B 6 M then A ∩ B 6 M.
Proof. By A 6M M and Lemma 3.2.1 we get δM
0 (X/A ∩ B) ≥ 0 for any X with
A ∩ B ⊆ X ⊆ B. So, by deﬁnition, A ∩ B 6M B. Together with B 6M M and the
transitivity of 6M, this gives us A ∩ B 6M M .
(cid:3)
Assume from now on that −∞ /∈ Im δM. For any A ∈ Fin(M ), if ¯A ∈ Fin(M )
0 ( ¯A) = δM(A) and A ⊆ ¯A, then ¯A 6 M. The above lemma guarantees that
with δM
the intersection of all such sets ¯A for a given A ∈ Fin(M ) is also self-suﬃcient in
M. Thus, we may unambiguously speak of the self-suﬃcient closure of A in M,
the smallest superset of A which is self-suﬃcient in M . It is easy to see that the
self-suﬃcient closure of a ﬁnite set is ﬁnite.

For an L-structure N and an embedding of N into M (in the sense of ﬁrst order
structures) f : N → M, we say f is a strong embedding if f [A] 6 M for any A 6 N .
When f is the identity map, we write N 6 M, thereby extending the notion of self-
suﬃciency to inﬁnite structures whose age is partial to C0 and whose dimension
function is integer-valued2. Note that by transitivity, this notion coincides with the

2Self-suﬃciency may be deﬁned also for structures with dimension −∞, but this is irrelevant

to our discussion

notation N 6 M for ﬁnite N . Additionally, transitivity holds by deﬁnition for this
extension of 6, as well as Lemma 3.2.1 and its corollary.

Corollary 3.2.5. The class of strong embeddings is closed under composition and
contains all isomorphism maps.
(cid:3)

Lemma 3.2.6. If N is d-closed in M then N is self-suﬃcient in M.
Proof. Denote N = N M. Let A 6 N , we show A 6 M. Let A ⊆ X ⊆ M such
0 (X) = δM(A). For any x ∈ X, by deﬁnition δM(A) ≤ δM(Ax). Also,
that δM
δM(Ax) ≤ δM
0 (X) = δM(A). So δM(Ax) = δM(A) and x is in the d-closure
of A in M and consequently in the d-closure of N in M. So X ⊆ N , therefore
δN (A) = δM(A) and thus A 6 M.
(cid:3)
3.3. Amalgamation. We say that (C, δ0) is a Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amalgamation
class if whenever A, B1, B2 ∈ C with strong embeddings fi : A → Bi (for i ∈ {1, 2}),
there exists some D ∈ C and strong embeddings gi : Bi → D such that g1 ◦ f1 =
g2 ◦ f2.
Deﬁnition 3.3.1. Let A, B1, B2 ∈ C0 such that A ⊆ Bi for i ∈ {1, 2} and B1∩B2 =
A. We say D is a simple amalgam of B1 and B2 over A (with respect to δ0) if it
has the following properties:

(1) D ∈ C0.
(2) The universe of D is D = B1 ∪ B2
(3) The induced substructures of D on the sets A, B1, B2 are A, B1, B2 respec-

tively.

(4) For all A ⊆ X ⊆ D, the equality δD

0 (X/A) = δD

0 (X ∩B1/A)+δD

0 (X ∩B2/A)

holds.

Observation. Let D be a simple amalgam of B1 and B2 over A. Let A ⊆ E ⊆ D
and denote Ei = E ∩ Bi. Then E is a simple amalgam of E1 and E2 over A.

Lemma 3.3.2. Let D be a simple amalgam of B1 and B2 over A. Then:

(1) If A 6 B1 then B2 6 D and D ∈ C.
(2) If in addition A 6 B2, then A 6 D.

Proof. Let B2 ⊆ X ⊆ D. Then:

δD
0 (X/B2) = δD
= δD
= δD
= δD

0 (B2)

0 (X) − δD
0 (X/A) − δD
0 (X ∩ B1/A) + δD
0 (X ∩ B1/A)

0 (B2/A)

0 (X ∩ B2/A) − δD

0 (B2/A)

Now assume that A 6 B1, then for any such X, we have δD
B2 6 D. By transitivity of 6 and ∅ 6 B2 we have ∅ 6 D and therefore D ∈ C.
Assume additionally that A 6 B2, then by transitivity and B2 6 D we have A 6 D.
(cid:3)

0 (X/B2) ≥ 0 and therefore

Deﬁnition 3.3.3. If for all A, B1, B2 ∈ C0 with A 6 B1, A ⊆ B2, and B1 ∩ B2 = A
there exists a simple amalgam of B1 and B2 over A , we say that (C, δ0) is a simple
Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amalgamation class.
Lemma 3.3.4. If (C, δ0) is a simple Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amalgamation class, then
in particular it is a Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amalgamation class.

12

OMER MERMELSTEIN

Proof. Let A, B1, B2 ∈ C be structures with strong embeddings fi
: A → Bi.
Without loss of generality, by renaming elements (this is no loss of generality by
Corollary 3.2.5) we may assume f1, f2 are identity maps and B1 ∩ B2 = A. Take
D to be a simple amalgam of B1 and B2 over A and let g1, g2 be the identity maps
on B1 and B2 respectively. Because A 6 Bi for i ∈ {1, 2}, by the previous lemma,
D ∈ C and g1, g2 are strong embeddings. So D fulﬁls the requirements.
(cid:3)

In a simple Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amalgamation class, we may take a simple amal-
gam over A of any ﬁnite list of structures A 6 B1, . . . , Bn with Bi ∩ Bj = A by
inductively amalgamating them one by one. Deﬁne D0 = A and deﬁne Di+1 to be
a simple amalgam of Di and Bi+1 over A. By construction, the resulting structure
D = Dn satisﬁes the following analogous properties:

(1) D ∈ C0.
(2) The universe of D is D = Sn
(3) The induced substructures of D on the sets A, B1, . . . , Bn are A, B1, . . . , Bn

i=1 Bi

respectively.

0 (X/A) = Pn

i=1 δD

(4) For all A ⊆ X ⊆ D, the equality δD
It is worth noting that for a class to always have a simple amalgam is strictly
stronger than being a Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amalgamation class. For example, the
class used in the original construction by Hrushovski in [7] (denoted in Hrushovski’s
paper by C0) did not possess this property.

0 (X ∩ Bi/A) holds.

3.4. The generic structure.

Deﬁnition 3.4.1. We say that a countable structure M is a generic structure for
(C, δ0) if age(M) ⊆ C and M has the following property:

(∗) If A 6 M and A 6 C for C ∈ C, then there is a strong embedding f : C → M

such that f ↾ A is the identity map on A.

Note that if M is a generic structure for (C, δ0), then age(M) = C. Every structure
in C may be strongly embedded into M over the empty set.
Lemma 3.4.2. Let M and N be generic structures for (C, δ0). Let f0 : A → B be
a ﬁnite partial isomorphism between M and N with A 6M M and B 6N N . Then
for any a ∈ M , there exists some f : ¯A → ¯B, a ﬁnite partial isomorphism between
M and N extending f0 such that:

(1) ¯A 6 M
(2) ¯B 6 N
(3) a ∈ ¯A

Proof. Without loss of generality, rename the elements of B so that f0 is the identity
map. Let ¯A be the self-suﬃcient closure of Aa in M, then ¯A 6 M and a ∈ ¯A.
Denote ¯A = ¯AM, A = AM, B = BN and note that A = B.

Since A ⊆ ¯A ⊆ M and A 6 M, by deﬁnition A 6 ¯A and so B 6 ¯A. So B 6 N ,
B 6 ¯A and ¯A ∈ C and so, since N is a generic structure for (C, δ0), there is a strong
embedding f : ¯A → N such that f ↾ B is the identity map, and in particular
f ↾ B = f0. Taking ¯B = Im(f ) concludes the proof.
(cid:3)
Corollary 3.4.3. Let M, N be generic structures for (C, δ0).

i. If f0 : A → B is a ﬁnite partial isomorphism with A 6 M and B 6 N , then f0

extends to an isomorphism of structures f : M → N .

REDUCTS BETWEEN NON-COLLPASED HRUSHOVSKI CONSTRUCTIONS

ii. M ∼= N

Proof.

i. By back and forth between self-suﬃcient substructures using the above

lemma.

ii. By the previous item, taking f0 to be the empty map.

(cid:3)

Proposition 3.4.4. If (C, δ0) is a Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amalgamation class then
there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) generic structure for (C, δ0).

Proof. By the above corollary, we need only prove existence.
Let M be a countably inﬁnite set. Let A ⊆ C be a countable family of structures,
closed under taking substructures, such that for any B ∈ C there exists some A ∈ A
with B ∼= A. Consider the following family of maps F = {f : A → M | A ∈ A} and
note that it is countable. Next, consider the countable family of tuples T ⊆ F ×A×A
given by T = {(f, A, B) | B ∈ A, A 6 B, f ∈ F, Dom(f ) = A}.
Let {(fi, Ai, Bi)}∞
inﬁnitely many times. We inductively build an ascending chain of structures

i=0 be an enumeration of T such that each tuple of T is repeated

M0 ⊆ M1 ⊆ M2 ⊆ . . .

such that Mi ⊆ M , Mi ∈ C and Mi 6 Mi+1 for every i ∈ N. We arbitrarily choose
M0 = ∅.

Assume that Mi is given. If Im(fi) 66 Mi, deﬁne Mi+1 = Mi. Otherwise, fi is a
strong embedding of A into Mi. Since (C, δ0) is a Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amalgamation
class, there exists some D ∈ C with strong embeddings g1 : Mi → D and g2 : Bi →
D such that g1 ◦ fi = g2 ↾ A. We ﬁx such a D. By renaming the elements of D, we
may assume that g1 is the identity, meaning Mi 6 D. Since M \ Mi is inﬁnite, we
may further rename the elements of D \ Mi so that D ⊆ M . Deﬁne Mi+1 = D.

We take M = S∞
i=0 Mi. Then M is a countable L-structure with age(M) ⊆ C.
By transitivity of 6 we have Mi 6 M for any i ∈ N. We show that M is a generic
structure for (C, δ0).

Let A 6 M and let A 6 C for some C ∈ C, then there is some B ∈ A with C ∼= B.
Thus, without loss of generality we may assume C ∈ A. Since A is closed under
taking substructures, we also have A ∈ A. Fix j ∈ N large enough such that A ⊆ Mj
and note that since A 6 M, by deﬁnition A 6 Mi for any i ≥ j. By taking f to be
the identity map on A, we get (f, A, B) ∈ T and in particular (f, A, B) = (fi, Ai, Bi)
for some i > j. By construction, there is a strong embedding g : B → Mi+1 such
that f = g ↾ A. So g : C → Mi+1 is a strong embedding such that g is the identity
map on A. Since Mi+1 6 M, in particular g is a strong embedding into M.
(cid:3)

Say (C, δ0) is a Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amalgamation class, we call its unique generic
structure the Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski limit of (C, δ0). Denote the Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski
limit of (C, δ0) by M and its universe by M , then by Proposition 3.1.2, δM deﬁnes a
pregeometry (M, clδ) on M . We call this pregeometry the pregoetmetry associated
with M or the pregeometry associated with (C, δ0).

The following deﬁnition and the proposition immediately after are a slight variant

of [3, Lemma 3.2].

Deﬁnition 3.5.1. We say (C1, δ1

0)   (C2, δ2

0) and (C2, δ2

0) if the following holds:

0) have the isomorphism extension

(∗) Let A1 ∈ C1, A2 ∈ C2 with f0 : A1 → A2 such that δA1

for all X ⊆ A1, and let C ∈ C1 with A1 61 C. Then there is some B1 ∈ C1
with C 61 B1 and B2 ∈ C2 with A2 62 B2 and some f : B1 → B2 extending
f0 with δB1

2 (f [X]) for all X ⊆ B1.

1 (X) = δA2

1 (X) = δB2

Observation 3.5.2. Since the class C2 is closed under isomorphisms, when proving
that (C1, δ1
0), in the notation of the deﬁnition above, we may assume
that f0 is the identity map and A1, A2 have the same universe A. We will always
use this observation without mention in these kind of proofs.

Assume that a bijection fj : A1 → A2 is given such that Ai 6i Mi and δ1(X) =
δ2(fj[X]) for all X ⊆ A1. Let m ∈ M1 be some element of M1 and let C 61 M1
be the self-suﬃcient closure of A1m in M1. Denote Ai = AMi

δB1
1 (X) = δB2
2 (g[X]) for all X ⊆ B1. Since M1 and M2 are generic, we may assume
that Bi 6i Mi and take fj+1 = g.
Now, choosing f0 = ∅ we have that f = Si∈N fi is an isomorphism of pregeome-

The following lemma and corollary are a technical scaﬀolding we will use later
in order to prove certain Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amalgamation classes have the isomor-
phism extension property.

Lemma 3.5.4. Let B1 ∈ C1 and B2 ∈ C2 be two structures with universe B and let
B2,
A ⊆ B be such that A 61 B1 and A 62 B2. Denote δ1
δ2 = δB2

0(Y /Y ∩A), then δ1(X) ≥ δ2(X)

iii. If δ1

0(Y /Y ∩ A) = δ2

0(Y /Y ∩ A) for all Y ⊆ B d-closed in either B1 or B2, then

δ1 = δ2.

Proof. Denote Ai = ABi. By Ai 6i Bi and Corollary 3.2.2, δAi

1 (Y a ∩ A) = δA1

1 (Y ∩ A). Then δ1(Y a ∩ A) = δ1(Y ∩ A)
and by submodularity, δ1(Y a) = δ1(Y ). Since Y is d-closed in B1, we have
a ∈ Y and in particular a ∈ Y ∩ A. Thus, Y ∩ A is d-closed in A1. Since
δA1
1 = δA2
2 , it must be that Y ∩ A is also d-closed in A2. By Lemma 3.2.6, we
have Y ∩ A 6i Ai and so δ1

0(Y ). Let
X ⊆ B be such that its d-closure in B1 is Y . Then δ1(X) = δ1(Y ). Since Y
is d-closed in B1, it is also self-suﬃcient in B1 and therefore δ1(Y ) = δ1
0(Y ).

0(Y /Y ∩ A), then by the previous item δ1

3.6. Reducts of generic structures. Fix (C1, δ1
0), two Fra¨ıss´e-
Hrushovski amalgamation classes with associated notions of self-suﬃciency 61, 62,
and generic structures M1, M2. We wish to ﬁnd a suﬃcient condition for M2 to be
isomorphic to a (proper) reduct of M1.

0) and (C2, δ2

Let L1 be the language of structures in C1 and let L2 be the language of struc-
tures in C2. For each R ∈ L2 ﬁx some L1-formula ϕR(¯x) (without parameters3).
For any structure M with age(M) ⊆ C1, let M+ be the deﬁnable expansion of M
to L1 ∪ L2 such that for all R ∈ L2

M+ |= ∀¯x(R(¯x) ↔ ϕR(¯x))

and denote M ↾ L2 = M+ ↾ L2. Denote M(2) = M1 ↾ L2.
The following deﬁnitions are with respect to our choice of {ϕR}R∈L2, and so is the
remainder of this subsection.
Deﬁnition 3.6.1. We say that 61 encloses reducts if whenever A ∈ C1, age(M) ⊆
C1, and A 61 M, also AM↾L2 = (A ↾ L2).
Deﬁnition 3.6.2. We say that C1 reduces to C2 if for every A ∈ C1 we have
(A ↾ L2) ∈ C2.
Lemma 3.6.3. If 61 encloses reducts, C1 reduces to C2 and age(M) ⊆ C1, then
age(M ↾ L2) ⊆ C2.
Proof. Denote M(2) = M ↾ L2. Let A ∈ Fin(M ). Let ¯A ∈ age(M) be the induced
structure on the self-suﬃcient closure of A in M. By ¯A 61 M we have ¯AM(2) =
( ¯A ↾ L2), and by ¯A ∈ C1 we have ( ¯A ↾ L2) ∈ C2. Since AM(2) ⊆ ¯AM(2) ∈ C2 we
also have AM(2) ∈ C2. Thus, age(M(2)) ⊆ C2.
(cid:3)
Deﬁnition 3.6.4. We say that 61 is stronger than 62 if whenever age(M) ⊆ C1
and A 61 M, also A 62(M ↾ L2).
Lemma 3.6.5. If 61 encloses reducts, C1 reduces to C2, and (C1, δ1
Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amalgamation class, then 61 is stronger than 62.
Proof. It is enough to show that for B ∈ C1, if A 61 B then A 62(B ↾ L2). Denote
B(2) = (B ↾ L2), A = AB, and A(2) = AB(2) . Because 61 encloses reducts, we also
have A(2) = (A ↾ L2). Since C1 reduces to C2 we have A(2), B(2) ∈ C2. As B is
arbitrary, it suﬃces to show that δ2

0) is a simple

0(B(2)/A(2)) ≥ 0.

Since B ∈ C1, we may assume that B 61 M1 and consequently A 61 M1. Let

r = δ2

0(A(2)) + 1, and note r > 0.

Let B1, . . . , Br be structures in C1 such that Bi ∩ Bj = A for all i < j and
Bi ∼= B over A for all i. Because C1 is a simple Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amalgamation
class, there exists D, a simple amalgam of all the Bi over A. By the properties of
a simple amalgam and the fact A 61 Bi for all i, we have A, B1, . . . , Br 61 D and
D ∈ C1. By A 61 M1, A 61 D, and the fact M1 is a generic structure for (C1, δ1
0),

3One can allow the use of a ﬁnite set of parameters from M1 by restricting the following

discussion to structures of C1 containing them.

16

we may strongly embed D into M1 over A. Without loss of generality, assume
D 61 M1.

Since Bi 61 M1 for every 1 ≤ i ≤ r, we have B

= (Bi ↾ L2) ∼= B(2). Since
A 61 M1 we have AM(2) = (A ↾ L2) = A(2). Denote D(2) = DM(2) and note that
since D 61 M1 we have D(2) = (D ↾ L2) ∈ C2.

< r · (δ2

But D(2) ∈ C2 and so δ2
the lemma is proven.

0(D(2)) ≥ 0. Thus, it must be that δ2

0(B(2)/A(2)) > −1 and
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 3.6.6. We say that (C1, δ1
0) if for
every A ∈ C1 and B ∈ C2 such that (A ↾ L2) 62 B there exists some C ∈ C1 such
that A 61 C and B 62(C ↾ L2).

0) has a mixed amalgam with (C2, δ2

Proposition 3.6.7. Assume that:

0) is a simple Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amalgamation class.
0) is a simple Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amalgamation class.

• (C1, δ1
• (C2, δ2
• C1 reduces to C2.
• 61 encloses reducts.
• (C1, δ1

0) has a mixed amalgam with (C2, δ2

0).

∼= M2.

Then M(2)
Proof. By Proposition 3.4.4, it suﬃces to show that M(2) is a generic structure for
0). Let A 62 M(2) with universe A and let B ∈ C2 such that A 62 B, we must
(C2, δ2
ﬁnd a strong embedding of B into M(2) over A.

Let ¯A be the self-suﬃcient closure of A in M1. Denote ¯A1 = ¯AM1 and ¯A(2) =
¯AM2. Because 61 encloses reducts, also ¯A(2) = ( ¯A1 ↾ L2). Note that A ⊆ ¯A(2),
and so because (C2, δ2
0) is a simple Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amalgamation class, we may
take D to be a simple amalgam of ¯A(2) and B over A. By Lemma 3.3.2, ¯A(2) 62 D
and D ∈ C2.

By the fact (C1, δ1

0) has a mixed amalgam with (C2, δ2

0), let C ∈ C1 be such that
¯A1 61 C and D 62(C ↾ L2). By the property of M1 as a generic structure, we may
strongly embed C into M1 over ¯A1. Assume without loss of generality that C 61 M1.
Because 61 encloses reducts, we have C M(2) = (C ↾ L2) and so BM(2) = B. Thus,
we have found an embedding of B into M(2) over A.

All of the conditions of Lemma 3.6.5 hold and so 61 is stronger than 62. Thus,
(C ↾ L2) 62 M(2). By our choice of C, also B 62(C ↾ L2) and thus, by transitivity,
B 62 M(2). This completes the proof.
(cid:3)
Deﬁnition 3.6.8. We say that (C1, δ1
there are structures A, B ∈ C1 such that

0) is benign towards (C2, δ2

0) if for any F ∈ C1

• F 61 A and F 61 B.

• A and B are not isomorphic over F .
• (A ↾ L2) and (B ↾ L2) are isomorphic over F

0) is benign towards (C2, δ2

Lemma 3.6.9. Under the assumptions of the above proposition, assume addition-
ally that (C1, δ1
0). Then M1 is not a deﬁnable expansion
of M(2) over any ﬁnite parameter set. In particular, if L2 is ﬁnite, M(2) is a proper
reduct of M1.
Proof. If M(2) is not a proper reduct of M1 and M+
1 is a deﬁnable expansion of
M(2), say over the parameter set F ⊆ M1, then any automorphism of M(2) which
ﬁxes F pointwise is also an automorphism of M+
1 , and in particular M1. We show
that this is not the case when F is ﬁnite, using the fact that M(2) is a generic
structure for (C2, δ2

We may assume F 61 M1 by replacing F with its self-suﬃcient closure, which is
ﬁnite. Let A and B be as promised by benignity with respect to F = F M1. By
F 61 A, B and the fact M1 is generic, A and B may be strongly embedded into M1
over F . Without loss of generality, assume A, B 61 M1.

Because 61 encloses reducts we have AM(2) = (A ↾ L2) and BM(2) = (B ↾ L2). By
Lemma 3.6.5, 61 is stronger than 62, and so we also have A 62 M(2) and B 62 M(2).
By benignity, let f0 be an isomorphism of AM(2) and BM(2) over F . Thus, f0 is a
ﬁnite partial isomorphism between strong substructures of M(2) and so by 3.4.3.i
f0 extends to some f , an automorphism of M(2). Since A and B are not isomorphic
over F , the bijection f is not an automorphism of M1.

0).

1 cannot be a deﬁnable expansion of M(2)
(cid:3)

Since F was general, as explained, M+

over a ﬁnite parameter set.

4. The structures Mg and their pregeometries

In this section we acquaint ourselves with a class of Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski amal-
gamation classes, as discussed in Section 3. We will use the notation for integer
valued functions presented in Subsection 2.1 with no explicit reference.
The contents of subsections 4.1 are mostly standard ( [2, Section 2], [11, Section
2]).

4.1. The class Cg.

Fix some n ∈ N. Fix some subgroup g ≤ Sn (Where Sn is the symmetric group

on n elements). Let Lg = {Rg} where Rg is an n-ary relation.
Deﬁnition 4.1.1. Let Cg

0 be the class of ﬁnite L-structures A such that:

• If A |= Rg(a1, . . . , an) then a1, . . . , an are distinct elements.
• A |= ∀x1, . . . , xn[Rg(x1, . . . , xn) ↔ Vσ∈g Rg(xσ(1), . . . , xσ(n))]

Note that Cg

it is a class of ﬁnite structures in a ﬁnite language, Cg
phism types.

0 is closed under isomorphism and taking substructures, and since
0 has countably many isomor-

In the context of Cg

0, an ordered tuple of elements is related in Rg if and only if
any permutation of the tuple that lies in g, is also related in Rg. It is thus best to
think of orbits under g instead of actual tuples.

Deﬁnition 4.1.2. Let x1, . . . , xn be distinct elements. Deﬁne:

[x1, . . . , xn]g = {(xσ(1), . . . , xσ(n)) | σ ∈ g}

18

OMER MERMELSTEIN

For a structure M with age(M) ⊆ Cg

0 deﬁne

Rg[A] = {[a1, . . . , an]g | A |= Rg(a1, . . . , an)}

Remark. In structures of Cg
0, we think of relations as tuples of the form [a1, . . . , an]g
rather than ordered tuples (a1, . . . , an). Thus, if when deﬁning an Lg-structure
M we do not deﬁne Rg(M) but deﬁne Rg[M] instead, it is to be taken that
Rg(M) = S Rg[M].

We call an object of the form [x1, . . . , xn]g a g-tuple or a g-relation.

Notation. We use the same notational shorthand for Rg[M] as we do for R(M),
i.e.

(1) If N ⊆ M we write Rg[M/N ] to mean Rg[M] \ Rg[N ].
(2) If N ⊆ M we write Rg
(3) If P ⊆ N ⊆ M , we write Rg

M[N ] to mean Rg[N M].

M[N/P ] to mean Rg[N M/P M].

Also, in the context of formulas, we use shorthand and write Rg[x1, . . . , xn] to mean

Vσ∈g Rg(xσ(1), . . . , xσ(n)).
Deﬁnition 4.1.3. Deﬁne for A ∈ Cg
0:

rg(A) = |{[a1, . . . , an]g | A |= Rg(a1, . . . , an)}| = |Rg[A]|

d0g(A) = |A| − rg(A)

Observation. If M is an Lg-structure with age(M) ⊆ Cg
then

0 and A, B ∈ Fin(M ),

0g (B/A) = (|A ∪ B| − rM
dM

g (A ∪ B)) − (|A| − rM
g (A ∪ B) − rM

g (A))

g (A))

= (|A ∪ B| − |A|) − (rM
= |B \ A| − rM

g (B/A)

Informally, if we think of B as being “added” to A, this value is the number of new
points added minus the number of new g-relations formed.
Lemma 4.1.4. The function d0g is submodular. Explicitly, if D ∈ Cg
0g (B) − dD
D, then dD
In addition, equality holds if and only if Rg

0g (A ∩ B).
D[(A ∪ B)] = Rg

0g (A ∪ B) ≤ dD

0 and A, B ⊆

0g (A) + dD

D[A] ∪ Rg

D[B].

Proof. We have |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| − |A ∩ B| and

rD
g (A ∪ B) = |Rg
≥ |Rg

= |Rg

D[B]|

D[(A ∪ B)]|
D[A] ∪ Rg
D[A]| + |Rg

D[A] ∩ Rg
D[(A ∩ B)]|

g (B) − rD

g (A ∩ B)

In addition, equality holds between the ﬁrst and second lines if and only if Rg
B)] = Rg

D[A] ∪ Rg

D[B].

D[(A∪

By subtracting the second inequality from the ﬁrst, we receive exactly the state-
(cid:3)

ment of the lemma.
Corollary 4.1.5. The function d0g is a predimension function on Cg
0.

REDUCTS BETWEEN NON-COLLPASED HRUSHOVSKI CONSTRUCTIONS

19

Proof. By its deﬁnition, d0g is perserved under isomorphisms, d0g (A) ≤ |A| for
any A ∈ Cg
0, and in particular d0g (∅) = 0. Submodularity is proved in the lemma
above.
(cid:3)

As d0g is a predimension function on Cg

0, as in Section 3, we associate with it a

scheme of dimension functions dM

g and a notion of self-suﬃciency 6g.

Corollary 4.1.6. For any A, B1, B2 ∈ Cg
0 such that A ⊆ Bi for i ∈ {1, 2} and
B1 ∩ B2 = A, there exists a simple amalgam of B1 and B2 over A (with respect to
d0g).

Proof. Recall the deﬁnition of a simple amalgam (Deﬁnition 3.3.1). Consider the
structure D with

D = B1 ∪ B2

Rg[D] = Rg[B1] ∪ Rg[B2]

We show that D is a simple amalgam of B1 and B2 over A. The only non-trivial
property we must verify is that dD
0g(X ∩ B2/A) for
all A ⊆ X ⊆ D. Since for any A ⊆ X ⊆ D the structure X D is constructed from
(X ∩ B1)D and (X ∩ B2)D the same way D was constructed from B1 and B2, it
suﬃces to show dD
0g(B2/A). This follows by construction
and the additional part of Lemma 4.1.4.
(cid:3)

0g(X ∩ B1/A) + dD

0g (X/A) = dD

0g (D/A) = dD

0g (B1/A) + dD

Deﬁne the class Cg = {A ∈ Cg
By the above corollary and Lemma 3.3.4, (Cg, d0g) is a (simple) Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski
amalgamation class. We denote the Fra¨ıss´e-Hrushovski limit of (Cg, d0g) by Mg and
recall that it has the following deﬁning property:

0 | ∅ 6g A}.

(∗) If A 6g Mg and A 6g C for C ∈ Cg, then there is a strong embedding f :

C → Mg such that f ↾ A is the identity map on A.

Notation 4.1.7. The cases where g is trivial or all of Sn will be of particular inter-
est to us. For the case g = {1Sn} we replace (Lg, Rg, Cg
0, Cg, d0g , dg, 6g, Mg) with
the notation (L6∼, R6∼, C6∼
0 , C6∼, d06∼, d6∼, 66∼, M6∼) and denote (a1, . . . , an) instead of
[a1, . . . , an]g.
0 , C∼, d0∼ , d∼, 6∼, M∼) and
Similarly, for the case g = Sn, we write (L∼, R∼, C∼
denote [a1, . . . , an] withouts the subscript for a g-tuple; we call such a tuple a
symmetric tuple.

4.2. Isomorphism of the pregeometries of M6∼ and Mg. Let n ∈ N be ﬁxed.
We will use Proposition 3.5.3 in order to show that the pregeometries associated
with (C6∼, d06∼) and (Cg, d0g ) are isomorphic, for any g ≤ Sn. Fix some g ≤ Sn
until the end of the section.

For the remainder of this section, assume that for each A ∈ C∼, there is some

ﬁxed order E such that it totally orders An.

Isomorphism extension from (Cg, d0g ) to (C6∼, d06∼ ).
Deﬁnition 4.2.1. Let X be some set and let R ⊆ X n. We say a set desym(R) ⊆
X n is a g-desymmetrization of R if (desym(R) ∩ [x1, . . . , xn]g) is of size exactly 1
for every (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ R.

20

OMER MERMELSTEIN

When we write desym(R), we implicitly mean that it is some arbitrary g-

desymmatrization of R.
Observation 4.2.2. If A ∈ Cg then | desym(Rg(A))| = rg(A).
Deﬁnition 4.2.3. Let B ∈ Cg and let A ⊆ B. Let A ∈ C6∼ be a structure with
universe A. We construct B≁

0 , a superstructure of A.

A ∈ C6∼

B≁

A := B

R6∼(B≁

A) := R6∼(A) ∪ desym(Rg

B(B/A))

A a desymmetrization of B over A.

We call B≁
Informally, a desymmetrization of B over A emulates the way B is related to AB,
but does so over A, disregarding the structure induced on the set A by B. Any
g-relations are then replaced by ordinary tuples, so the resulting structure is in C6∼
0 .
Lemma 4.2.4. Let B ∈ Cg be a structure with universe B. Let A ⊆ B and let
A ∈ C6∼ be a structure with universe A. Let B≁
A be a desymmetrization of B over
A. Then dB
If in addition A 6g B, then A 66∼ B≁

06∼ (X/X ∩ A) for all X ⊆ B.

0g (X/X ∩ A) = dB≁

A and B≁

A

A ∈ C6∼.

Proof. The ﬁrst part is immediate from the construction and Observation 4.2.2.
The additional part follows by deﬁnition.
(cid:3)
Proposition 4.2.5. Let   be as in Deﬁnition 3.5.1, then (Cg, d0g)   (C6∼, d06∼ ).
Proof. Let A1 ∈ Cg, A2 ∈ C6∼ be structures with universe A such that dA1
g (X) =
dA2
6∼ (X) for all X ⊆ A. Let B ∈ Cg with A1 6g B.
Denote D = B≁

A2 some desymmetrization of B over A. By the additional part
of the above lemma, D ∈ C6∼ and A2 66∼ D. By the main statement of the above
lemma, for any Y ⊆ B the equality dB
06∼ (Y /Y ∩ A) holds, in
particular if Y is d-closed in B or D. By Lemma 3.5.4.iii, dD
g (X) for all
X ⊆ B, and so B and D along with the identity map are the structures sought
for.
(cid:3)
Isomorphism extension from (C6∼, d06∼) to (Cg, d0g ). Imitating the pregeome-
try of a structure A ∈ C6∼ with a structure from Cg is less obvious. The diﬃculty
is that the predimension of a structure of size n may be as low as zero in C6∼, but
if g is of index strictly smaller than n, this is not the case in Cg. We resolve this
diﬃculty by attaching to each related tuple (a1, . . . , an) a new element e(a1,...,an)
which will allow us more freedom without changing the dependencies among points
inside the original structure.

0g(Y /Y ∩ A) = dD

6∼(X) = dB

In this subsection we use ¯a and (a1, . . . , an) interchangeably.

Deﬁnition. Let B ∈ C6∼ and let A ⊆ B. Deﬁne:

• newel(B/A) = {e(¯a) | ¯a ∈ R6∼
• newrel(B/A) = {(e(¯a), a1, . . . , an−1) | e(¯a) ∈ newel(B/A)}
Deﬁnition 4.2.6. Let B ∈ C6∼ and let A ⊆ B. We deﬁne Brlx
of B:

B(B/A)}

A , a superstructure

Brlx

A = B ∪ newel(B/A)

R6∼(Brlx

A ) = R6∼(B) ∪ newrel(B/A)

REDUCTS BETWEEN NON-COLLPASED HRUSHOVSKI CONSTRUCTIONS

We call Brlx

A the relaxation of B over A.

Observation. Let B ∈ C6∼ and let A ⊆ B. Then B 66∼ Brlx
A ∈ C6∼
Brlx
Deﬁnition. Let B ∈ C6∼ and let A ⊆ B. Deﬁne

A and consequently

Adjust(B/A) = {[e(¯a), a1, . . . , an−1]g, [e(¯a), a2, . . . , an]g | e(¯a) ∈ newel(B/A)}

Deﬁnition 4.2.7. Let B ∈ C6∼ and let A ⊆ B. Let A ∈ Cg be a structure with
universe A. We construct Bg

0, a superstructure of A:

A ∈ Cg

Bg
A = B ∪ newel(B/A)
R∼[Bg
A] = Rg[A] ∪ Adjust(B/A)

We call Bg

A the relaxed symmetrization of B over A.

Lemma 4.2.8. Let C ∈ C6∼ and let A ⊆ C. Let A ∈ Cg be a structure with
universe A. Denote B = Crlx
A, the relaxed
symmetrization of C over A. Denote the common universe of B and D by B. Then:

A , the relaxation of C over A, and D = C g

• If Y ⊆ B is d-closed in B then dB
• If Y ⊆ B is d-closed in D then dB
• If A 66∼ C then A 6g D and D ∈ Cg.

06∼ (Y /Y ∩ A) = dD
06∼ (Y /Y ∩ A) = dD

0g(Y /Y ∩ A).
0g (Y /Y ∩ A).

Proof. We say that Y ⊆ B is good, if for every e(¯a) ∈ newel(C/A), if {a1, . . . , an−1} ⊆
Y or {a2, . . . , an} ⊆ Y , then a1, . . . , an, e(¯a) ∈ Y . Note that if Y ⊆ B is d-closed in
either B or D, then it is good.

Let Y ⊆ B be good. In order to prove the ﬁrst two points, it is enough to prove

that rB
Observe that by construction of B and the assumption on Y :

g (Y /Y ∩ A).

6∼(Y /Y ∩ A) = rD
6∼(Y /Y ∩ A) = X
rB

|{¯a, (e(¯a), a1, . . . , an−1)}| = 2 · rC

6∼(Y ∩ C/A)

¯a∈R6∼

C(Y ∩C/A)

Again, by construction of D and the assumption on Y , clearly:

g (Y /Y ∩ A) = X
rD

rD
g (¯ae(¯a)) = 2 · rC

6∼(Y ∩ C/A)

¯a∈R6∼

C(Y ∩C/A)

We prove the third point. Assume now that A 66∼ C. Since C 66∼ B by the above
observation, by transitivity we have A 66∼ B. Let A ⊆ X ⊆ B and deﬁne
Y = X∪{a1, . . . , an, e(¯a) | ¯a ∈ R6∼
By construction of D, dD
As Y is good, by A 66∼ B and what we showed, 0 ≤ dB
conclusion, dD

C(C/A), {a1, . . . , an−1} ⊆ X or {a2, . . . , an} ⊆ X}
0∼ (X). This implies that dD
0∼(X/A).
In
(cid:3)

0∼ (X/A) ≥ 0. Thus, because X was arbitrary, A 6g D.

06∼(Y /A) = dD

0∼ (Y /A) ≤ dD

0∼(Y ) ≤ dD

0∼ (Y /A).

Proposition 4.2.9. (C6∼, d06∼ )   (Cg, d0g)
Proof. Let A1 ∈ C6∼, A2 ∈ Cg be structures with universe A such that dA1
g (X) for all X ⊆ A. Let C ∈ C6∼ with A1 66∼ C.
dA2

6∼ (X) =

Denote B = Crlx

A , the relaxation of C over A, and D = C g

, the relaxed sym-
metrization of C over A2. Denote the common universe of B and D by B. By the
above lemma, D ∈ Cg and A2 6g D.

22

OMER MERMELSTEIN

By the ﬁrst two items of the above lemma and Lemma 3.5.4.iii, we have dB

6∼(X) =
dD
∼(X) for all X ⊆ B. Thus, B and D along with the identity map are the structures
sought for.
(cid:3)

Theorem 4.2.10. The pregeometry associated with M6∼ is isomorphic to the pre-
geometry associated with Mg, for every g ≤ Sn.
(cid:3)

5. Reduction relations between the structures Mg

For this section we let n ∈ N≥3 be ﬁxed. We will prove that for any h, g ≤ Sn,

the structure Mg is isomorphic to a proper reduct of Mh.

5.1. Proper reduction of Mh to Mg. Fix some subgroups h, g ≤ Sn such that
h ≤ g. Consider the LH -formula

ϕRg(x1, . . . , xn) := _

Rh(xσ(1), . . . , xσ(n))

σ∈g

For an Lh-structure M with age(M) ⊆ Ch, let M+ be the deﬁnable expansion of
M to Lh ∪ Lg where

M+ |= ∀x1, . . . , xn(Rg(x1, . . . , xn) ↔ ϕRg (x1, . . . , xn))

and denote MRg = M+ ↾ Lg. Note that age(M) ⊆ Cg
We will show that Mg ∼= (Mh)Rg and that h (cid:8) g implies (Mh)Rg is a proper reduct.
For the remainder of this subsection we use the deﬁnitions and results of Subsection
3.6 with respect to our choice of ϕRg .

0 by deﬁnition of ϕRg .

Observation 5.1.1. If A ⊆ M for some structure with age(M) ⊆ Ch, then
AMRg = ARg . In particular, 6h encloses reducts. (Deﬁnition 3.6.1)

Lemma 5.1.2. For any A ∈ Ch, d0h(A) ≤ d0g (ARg ).

Proof. Explicitly, ARg is the structure with universe A and

Rg[ARg ] = {[x1, . . . , xn]g | [x1, . . . , xn]h ∈ Rh[A]}

Thus by deﬁnition, rh(A) ≥ rg(ARg ) and the lemma is evident.

(cid:3)

Corollary 5.1.3. Ch reduces to Cg (Deﬁnition 3.6.2)
Proof. Let A ∈ Ch. We have already noted that ARg ∈ Cg
lemma, 0 ≤ d0h (A) ≤ d0g(ARg ). So ARg ∈ Cg.

0, and by the above
(cid:3)

Lemma 5.1.4. (Ch, d0h) has a mixed amalgam with (Cg, d0g ). (Deﬁnition 3.6.6)
Proof. Let A ∈ Ch and let B ∈ Cg with ARg 6∼ B. Choose some section S ⊆
S Rg[B/ARg] such that |S ∩ [a1, . . . , an]g| = 1 for each [a1, . . . , an]g ∈ Rg[B/ARg].

Let C be the structure:

C := B

Rh[C] := Rh[A] ∪ {[a1, . . . , an]h | (a1, . . . , an) ∈ S}

Just as in Lemma 4.2.4 and the short discussion preceding it, because ARg 6g B,
we have A 6h C and C ∈ Ch. By construction, it is clear that CRg = B and in
particular B 6∼ CRg.
(cid:3)

Lemma 5.1.5. If h (cid:8) g, then (Ch, d0h) is benign towards (Cg, d0g ). (Deﬁnition
3.6.8)
Proof. Let F ∈ Ch. Let a1, . . . , an /∈ F be distinct new elements. Let σ ∈ g \ h.
Deﬁne the structure A with

A = F ∪ {a1, . . . , an}

Rh[A] = Rh[F ] ∪ [a1, . . . , an]h

Deﬁne the structure B with

B = F ∪ {a1, . . . , an}

Rh[B] = Rh[F ] ∪ {[a1, . . . , an]h, [aσ(1), . . . , aσ(n)]h}

Clearly A and B fulﬁl the requirements in the deﬁnition.
Theorem 5.1.6. If h ≤ g, then the structure Mg is isomorphic to a reduct of Mh.
If in addition h (cid:20) g, then Mg is isomorphic to a proper reduct of Mh.
Proof. All conditions of Proposition 3.6.7 hold with respect to (Ch, d0h) and (Cg, d0g).
Thus, (Mh)Rg

∼= Mg.

(cid:3)

If additionally h (cid:8) g, then the conditions of Lemma 3.6.9 also hold and (Mh)Rg
(cid:3)

is a proper reduct of Mh.
5.2. Exquisite formulas. In this subsection and the next, we construct a formula
which will allow us to reduce from M∼ to M6∼.
Notation 5.2.1. For a tuple ¯a = (a1, . . . , am) we write s(¯a) for the set of elements
appearing in ¯a. i.e. s(¯a) = {a1, . . . , am}.

Recall that n is the arity of R∼. We limit our discussion to the class of L∼-

structures whose age is partial to C∼
0 .
Deﬁnition 5.2.2. Let q(¯x; ¯y) be a complete L∼ atomic type of ¯x¯y. For a tuple ¯a¯b
with |¯a¯b| = ¯x¯y we deﬁne

Gq(¯a; ¯b) = {[c1, . . . , cn] | q(¯a; ¯b) |= R∼(c1, . . . , cn)}

We denote dq = |¯a¯b| − |Gq(¯a; ¯b)|.

Deﬁnition 5.2.3. Let q(¯x; ¯y) be a complete L∼ atomic type of ¯x¯y

i. We say that q is nice if q(¯x; ¯y) implies that the elements of ¯x¯y are pairwise

distinct, |¯x| = n, |¯y| ≥ 2n, q(¯x; ¯y) =⇒ ¬R∼(¯x) and dq = n − 1.

ii. We say that q is intertwined if d0∼ (s(¯a¯b)/X) < 0 whenever q(¯a; ¯b) holds, X ⊂

s(¯a¯b), and |X| > n.

iii. We say that q is without symmetry if q(¯x; ¯y) = q(¯u; ¯v) implies ¯x¯y = ¯u¯v.
iv. We say that q is exquisite if it is nice, intertwined and without symmetry.

Observation 5.2.4. For q(¯x; ¯y) nice, |Gq(¯x; ¯y)| = |y| + 1 > 2n

Notation 5.2.5. For q(¯x; ¯y) a complete L∼ atomic type of ¯x¯y, denote by q+(¯x; ¯y)
the formula

q+(¯x; ¯y) :=

R∼(z1, . . . , zn)

Observation 5.2.6. If p(¯x, ¯y) is a complete L∼ atomic type implying q+(¯x; ¯y) for
some q(¯x; ¯y) intertwined, then p(¯x, ¯y) is intertwined.

Notation 5.2.7. For q(¯x; ¯y), a complete atomic type of ¯x¯y, denote by ψq(¯x; ¯y)
the formula stating that for every ¯u¯v such that q+(¯u; ¯v) holds, if ¯x¯y 6= ¯u¯v, then
| s(¯x¯y) ∩ s(¯u¯v)| ≤ n.

For q an atomic type, we denote bq(¯x; ¯y) = q(¯x; ¯y) ∧ ψq(¯x; ¯y). When we say that

bq is an exquisite formula, we mean that q is exquisite.

Until the end of this subsection, let q(¯x; ¯y) be some ﬁxed exquisite atomic type.

Deﬁnition 5.2.8.

i. For R a set of symmetric n-tuples we say that ¯a¯b is adjacent to R if bq(¯a; ¯b)
holds and Gq(¯a; ¯b) ∩ R 6= ∅.
ii. We say that ¯a¯b and ¯c ¯d distinct are adjacent if bq(¯a; ¯b) and bq(¯c; ¯d) hold, and
Gq(¯a; ¯b) ∩ Gq(¯c; ¯d) 6= ∅.
iii. We say that bq is asocial if |Gq(¯a; ¯b)∩Gq(¯c; ¯d)| = 1 whenever ¯a¯b, ¯c ¯d are adjacent.
Observation 5.2.9. An exquisite formula bq(¯x; ¯y) is asocial.
Deﬁnition 5.2.10. For R, a set of symmetric n-tuples, call a sequence of distinct
tuples (¯a1¯b1, . . . , ¯ak¯bk) an R-adjacency-chain if

• ¯a1¯b1 is adjacent to R
• ¯ai¯bi is adjacent to ¯ai+1¯bi+1 for 1 ≤ i < k.

Deﬁnition 5.2.11. For R, a set of symmetric n-tuples, call an R-adjacency-chain
(¯a1¯b1, . . . , ¯ak¯bk) an R-adjacency-loop if

• If k = 1, then |R ∩ Gq(¯ak; ¯bk)| ≥ 2
• If k > 1, denoting the unique symmetric tuple in Gq(¯ak−1; ¯bk−1)∩Gq(¯ak; ¯bk)
by r, we have that ¯ak¯bk is adjacent to (R ∪ Sk−2

i=1 Gq( ¯ai; ¯bi)) \ {r}

We say that (¯a1¯b1, . . . , ¯ak¯bk) is proper if in addition Gq(¯ak; ¯bk) * R
Lemma 5.2.12. Let M be an L∼-structure with age(M) ⊆ C∼

i=1 s(¯ai¯bi)| − |R ∪Sk

i=1 Gq(¯ai; ¯bi)| ≤ |B| − |R|

0 . Let B ⊆ M be

Proof.

i. We prove by induction on k:
k = 1: If s(¯a1¯b1) ⊆ B then the statement is clear, assume this is not the case. We
have R ∩ Gq(¯a1; ¯b1) 6= ∅, which implies |B ∩ s(¯a1¯b1)| ≥ n. Let x ∈ s(¯a1¯b1) \ B, then
because q is intertwined, s(¯a1¯b1) is in the self-suﬃcient closure of (Bx∩s(¯a1¯b1)) and,
moreover, | s(¯a1¯b1)\Bx|−|Gq (¯a1; ¯b1)\R| < 0. Since | s(¯a1¯b1)\B| = | s(¯a1¯b1)\Bx|+1,
this gives us | s(¯a1¯b1) \ B| − |Gq(¯a1; ¯b1) \ R| ≤ 0 and thus the statement.

k > 1: Denote B1 = B ∪ s(¯a1¯b1) and R1 = R ∪ Gq(¯a1; ¯b1). By the previous
case, since (¯a1¯b1) is an R-adjacency-chain, we have that |B1| − |R1| ≤ |B| − |R|.
Now, (¯a2¯b2, . . . , ¯ak¯bk) is an R1-adjacency-chain of length k − 1, so by induction
hypothesis |B1 ∪Sk
i=2 Gq(¯ai; ¯bi)| ≤ |B1| − |R1|. The statement

i=2 s(¯ai¯bi)| − |R1 ∪Sk

immediately follows.

ii. Assume ﬁrst that |R ∩ Gq(¯ak; ¯bk)| ≥ 2. Then | s(¯ak¯bk) ∩ B| > n. Since q
is intertwined and Gq(¯ak; ¯bk) * R, we have | s(¯ak¯bk) \ B| − |Gq(¯ak; ¯bk) \ R| < 0.
Denoting Bk = B ∪s(¯ak¯bk) and Rk = R∪Gq(¯ak; ¯bk), we have |Bk|−|Rk| < |B|−|R|.

If k = 1, then we are done. Otherwise, note that (¯a1¯b1, . . . , ¯ak−1¯bk−1) is an Rk-
adjacency-chain, so by what we proved |Bk ∪Sk−1
i=1 Gq(¯ai; ¯bi)| ≤
|Bk| − |Rk|, and we are done.

i=1 s(¯ai¯bi)|−|Rk ∪Sk−1

We can now prove the general statement inductively.
If k = 1, then |R ∩ Gq(¯ak; ¯bk)| ≥ 2 and we just proved the statement for this

case. So we may assume k > 1 and |R ∩ Gq(¯ak; ¯bk)| < 2.
Denote B1 = B ∪ s(¯a1¯b1) and R1 = R ∪ Gq(¯a1; ¯b1), then as before |B1| − |R1| ≤
|B|−|R|. It is clear that (¯a2¯b2, . . . , ¯ak¯bk) is an R1-adjacency-loop. Since bq is asocial,
|Gq(¯a1; ¯b1)∩Gq(¯ak; ¯bk)| ≤ 1. By deﬁnition of R1, we thus have |R1 ∩Gq(¯ak; ¯bk)| ≤ 2.
Since |Gq(¯ak; ¯bk)| ≥ 3, this means Gq(¯ak; ¯bk) * R1 and so (¯a2¯b2, . . . , ¯ak¯bk) is proper.
By induction hypothesis, |B1 ∪ Sk
i=2 Gq(¯ai; ¯bi)| < |B1| − |R1|
(cid:3)

i=2 s(¯ai¯bi)| − |R1 ∪ Sk

and the proof is complete.

Deﬁnition 5.2.13. Let M be some L∼-structure with age(M) ⊆ C∼
0 .

Say that (¯a¯b, ¯c ¯d) is a collision in M if ¯a¯b is adjacent to ¯c ¯d. Deﬁne cM to be the

number of collisions in M.

Say that (¯a¯b, ¯c ¯d) is a weak-collision in M if M |= q+(¯a; ¯b)∧q+(¯c; ¯d) and Gq(¯a; ¯b)∩

Gq(¯c; ¯d) 6= ∅. Deﬁne wM to be the number of weak-collisions in M.

Deﬁnition 5.2.14. Let M be some L∼-structure with age(M) ⊆ C∼
that r ∈ R∼[M] is bq-unique in M if

• There exists a unique tuple ¯ar ¯br ∈ M such that M |= bq( ¯ar; ¯br) and r ∈
Gq( ¯ar; ¯br).
• The tuple ¯ar ¯br appears in a collision in M.

0 . We say

For N an L∼-structure with N ⊆ M and R∼[N ] ⊆ R∼[M], we say that r ∈

R∼[N ] is bq[M]-unique in N if

• There exists a unique tuple ¯ar ¯br ∈ N such that M |= bq( ¯ar; ¯br), r ∈
Gq( ¯ar; ¯br) and Gq( ¯ar; ¯br) ⊆ R∼[N ].
• The tuple ¯ar ¯br appears in a collision in M.

R∼

Lemma 5.2.15. Let A ∈ C∼ be such that cA > 0, then there is some r ∈ R∼[A]
which is bq-unique in A.
Proof. Assume that the statement is false. Let A ∈ C∼ be such that cA > 0 and
there is no bq-unique tuple in A.

Claim. Consider any L∼-structure B with universe B ⊆ A and R∼[B] = RB ⊆
If there is some ¯a¯b ∈ B with Gq(¯a; ¯b) ⊆ RB and some r1 ∈ Gq(¯a; ¯b)
A[B].
bq[A]-unique in B, then there is in A a proper RB-adjacency-loop (¯a1¯b1, . . . , ¯ak¯bk)
with r1 ∈ Gq(¯a1; ¯b1) and ¯a1¯b1 6= ¯a¯b.
Proof. Since r1 is not bq-unique in A, there is in A some ¯a1¯b1 adjacent to ¯a¯b such
that r1 ∈ Gq(¯a1; ¯b1). Let r2 ∈ Gq(¯a1; ¯b1) \ {r1}. Since r2 is not bq-unique in A,
there is in A some ¯a2¯b2 adjacent to ¯a1¯b1 with r2 ∈ Gq(¯a2; ¯b2). Continuing in this
manner, choosing ri ∈ Gq(¯ai; ¯bi) \ {ri−1}, for every k we have that (¯a1¯b1, . . . , ¯ak¯bk)
is an RB-adjacency-chain. Since A is ﬁnite, there is some large enough l such
that ¯al¯bl = ¯am¯bm for some m < l. So by construction, (¯a1¯b1, . . . , ¯al−1¯bl−1) is an
RB-adjacency-loop.

Now let k be minimal such that (¯a1¯b1, . . . , ¯ak¯bk) is an RB-adjacency-loop. Since
r1 is bq[A]-unique in B, it must be that Gq(¯a1; ¯b1) * RB. If, however Gq(¯ak; ¯bk) ⊆

26

OMER MERMELSTEIN

RB, then (¯a1¯b1, . . . , ¯ak−1¯bk−1) is an RB-adjacency-loop in contradiction to the min-
imality of k. So Gq(¯ak; ¯bk) * RB and so (¯a1¯b1, . . . , ¯ak¯bk) is proper.

and Ai+1 the structure with universe Xi+1 and R∼[Ai+1] = Ri+1.

i=1 s(¯ai¯bi), Ri+1 = Ri ∪Sk

Let i < n and assume that Xi ⊆ A and R0 ⊆ Ri ⊆ R∼

In order to proceed with the inductive construction, we only need to show that

Now, ﬁx some ¯a¯b ∈ A such that ¯a¯b appears in a collision in A. Denote tq =
|Gq(¯a; ¯b)|. We describe an inductive process. Denote X0 = s(¯a¯b), R0 = Gq(¯a; ¯b) =
{r1, . . . , rtq } and let A0 be the L∼-structure with universe X0 and R∼[A0] = R0.
Note that at least (2n + 1) of {r1, . . . , rtq } are bq[A]-unique in A0.
A[Xi] are given and
that, in the structure Ai with universe Xi and R∼[Ai] = Ri, at least (2(n − i) + 1)
elements of {r1, . . . , rtq } are bq[A]-unique in Ai.
By the claim, choose some proper Ri-adjacency-loop (¯a1¯b1, . . . , ¯ak¯bk) with k
minimal, such that ¯a1¯b1 6= ¯a¯b, and rj ∈ Gq(¯a1; ¯b1) for some 1 ≤ j ≤ tq such that rj
is bq[A]-unique in Ai. Deﬁne Xi+1 = Xi ∪Sk
i=1 Gq(¯ai; ¯bi)
at least (2(n − i − 1) + 1) elements of {r1, . . . , rtq } are bq[A]-unique in Ai+1. We
show that if m 6= j is such that rm is bq[A]-unique in Ai but not in Ai+1, then
rm ∈ Gq(¯ak; ¯bk).
Let ¯c ¯d be such that rm ∈ Gq(¯c; ¯d) and Gq(¯c; ¯d) ⊆ Ri+1, but Gq(¯c; ¯d) * Ri.
Assume ¯c ¯d 6= ¯ak¯bk. By minimality of k, also ¯c ¯d 6= ¯ai¯bi for every i < k. If Gq(¯c; ¯d) ∩
Ri = {rm}, then because Gq(¯c; ¯d) ⊆ Ri+1, by asociality of bq, it must be that ¯c ¯d is
adjacent to tq − 1 many tuples of (¯a1¯b1, . . . , ¯ak¯bk) in contradiction to the minimality
of k. So (¯c ¯d) is a proper Ri-adjacency-loop.
Let l be minimal such that (¯c ¯d) is a proper Rl-adjacency-loop and note that
l ≤ i and |Gq(¯c; ¯d) ∩ Rl| = 2. Since at each stage of the construction we choose
a proper adjacency-loop of minimal length, we have that for every l ≤ s ≤ i,
in the s-th stage we have chosen a proper adjacency-loop of length 1, say ( ¯cs ¯ds).
Therefore, by asociality of bq, if ¯c ¯d 6= ¯cs ¯ds, then |Gq(¯c; ¯d) ∩ (Rs+1 \ Rs)| ≤ 1.
We know that Gq(¯c; ¯d) * Ri, thus ¯c ¯d 6= ¯cs ¯ds for all s < i, and consequently
|Gq(¯c; ¯d) ∩ Ri| ≤ (i − l) + 2 ≤ (n − 1) + 2 < tq − 1. Now, noting that ¯ci ¯di = ¯ak¯bk,
as |Gq(¯c; ¯d) ∩ Ri+1| = tq, it must be that |Gq(¯c; ¯d) ∩ Gq(¯ak; ¯bk)| ≥ 2. By asociality,
this is a contradiction and so ¯c ¯d = ¯ak¯bk, and rm ∈ Gq(¯ak; ¯bk).
Now, by asociality of bq, we have |Gq(¯ak; ¯bk) ∩ Gq(¯a; ¯b)| ≤ 1. Thus, m is uniquely
determined and any symmetric tuple r ∈ {r1, . . . , rtq } \ {rj, rm} which was bq[A]-
unique in Ai is also bq[A]-unique in Ai+1, in particular, at least (2(n − i − 1) + 1)
So we are able to construct this way A0, . . . , An. By construction and Lemma
5.2.12, we have |Xi+1| − |Ri+1| < |Xi| − |Ri| which is exactly d0∼ (Ai+1) < d0∼ (Ai).
Inductively this gives us d0∼ (An) ≤ d0∼(A0) − n.
It is only left to recall that
d0∼(A0) = dq < n and then

elements.

dA
0∼(Xn) ≤ d0∼(An) ≤ d0∼ (A0) − n < 0

So A /∈ C∼ in contradiction to its choice. We conclude that there must be some
bq-unique symmetric tuple in any A ∈ C∼ with cA > 0.

Proof. Assume that the statement is false and let D with ¯a¯b ∈ D be a counter
example. Denote X = s(¯a¯b).

Let T = R∼

D[X] \ Gq(¯a; ¯b), and consider the structure D′ with universe D and
R∼[D′] = R∼[D] \ T . The structure D′ with the tuple ¯a¯b is also a counter example
to the statement of the lemma, so we may assume that D |= q(¯a; ¯b) to begin with.
Denote X0 = X ∩ A, note that |X0| ≤ n. Let i be such that X ∩ Bi * X0. By

assumption, X \ Bi 6= ∅. Denote X1 = X ∩ Bi and X2 = (X \ Bi) ∪ X0.

Since |X| > 2n, either |X1| > n or |X2| > n. Without loss of generality assume
|X1| > n. By the properties of D as a simple amalgam and the fact q is intertwined,
d0∼(X2/X0) = dD
0∼ (X0) ≤ |X0|. Choose arbitrar-
ily some Y ⊆ X1 \ X0 with |Y | = (n − |X0|), then dD
0∼ (X2Y ) < |X0| + |Y | = n.
As |X2Y | > n and q is intertwined, dD
0∼(X) ≤ n − 2 in
contradiction to dD
0∼ (X) = dq = n − 1.

0∼ (X/X2Y ) < 0. Thus, dD

0∼(X2/X1) < 0. So dD

0∼(X2) < dD

every ¯a ∈ A.

Proposition 5.2.17. Let A ∈ C∼ with cA > 0. Then there exists some B ∈ C∼
with A ⊆ B, wB < wA and such that if A |= ∃¯ybq(¯a; ¯y), then B |= ∃¯ybq(¯a; ¯y), for
Proof. Let A ∈ C∼ with cA > 0. By Lemma 5.2.15 there exists some bq-unique
r ∈ R∼[A]. Let ¯a¯b ∈ A be the unique tuple such that r ∈ Gq(¯a; ¯b). Let ¯w be a
tuple of new elements with |¯b| = | ¯w|. We deﬁne a new L∼-structure B as follows:

B = A ∪ s( ¯w)

R∼[B] = (R∼[A] \ {r}) ∪ Gq(¯a; ¯w)

Note that B is a simple amalgam of AB and s(¯a ¯w)B over s(¯a)B.
First we show B ∈ C∼. Assume the contrary, then there is some X ⊆ B such that
0∼(X) < 0. Choose X to be such that dB
dB
0∼ (X) is minimal. If X ⊆ A, then by
construction dB
0∼ (X) ≥ 0. So it must be X * A. Let c ∈ X ∩ s( ¯w), since
B[X] in which c appears.
dB
0∼(X) is minimal, there is some symmetric tuple in R∼
In particular, by construction, |X ∩ s(¯a ¯w)| ≥ n, and so dB
0∼(s(¯a ¯w)/X) ≤ 0. Thus,
we may assume s(¯a ¯w) ⊆ X.

0∼ (X) ≥ dA

Because dB

0∼ (X) < 0, we have dB

0∼ (s(¯a ¯w)) = n − 1 and dB

0∼ (X/ s(¯a ¯w)) < 1 − n.
As B is a simple amalgam, dB
0∼(X ∩ A) ≤
0∼(X ∩ A) ≤ 0. If s(¯b) ⊆ X then by construction dA
dB
0∼ (X ∩ A) ≤ 0
which is impossible, so s(¯b) * X. But s(¯b) is in the self-suﬃcient closure of s(¯a) in
A, so X ∩ A is not self-suﬃcient in A, which is a contradiction to dA
0∼(X ∩ A) ≤ 0.
We conclude that dB

0∼ (X ∩ A/ s(¯a)) < 1 − n and therefore dA

0∼(X) ≥ 0 for any X ⊆ B and B ∈ C∼.

0∼(X ∩ A) < dB

Let ¯c ¯d be such that B |= q+(¯c; ¯d). By Lemma 5.2.16 either s(¯c ¯d) ⊆ s(¯a ¯w) or
If s(¯c ¯d) ⊆ s(¯a ¯w), then since q is without symmetry, ¯c ¯d = ¯a ¯w. By

s(¯c ¯d) ⊆ A.
construction of B, if s(¯c ¯d) ⊆ A, then already A |= q+(¯c; ¯d).

Now, we show that wB < wA. Let ( ¯c1 ¯d1, ¯c2 ¯d2) be a weak-collision in B.

If
s( ¯ci ¯di) ⊆ A for i ∈ {1, 2}, then by what we showed this is already a weak collision
in A. Otherwise, it must be that one of the tuples in the weak-collision is ¯a ¯w and
so s( ¯c1 ¯d1) ∩ s( ¯c2 ¯d2) ⊆ s(¯a). This, however, cannot be, because B |= ¬R∼(¯a). So we
have wB ≤ wA. Now, since r is bq-unique in A, it was involved in a collision, which
no longer exists in B because B |= ¬q+(¯a; ¯b). We conclude that wB < wA.
It remains to show that for ¯c ∈ A, if A |= ∃¯ybq(¯c; ¯y), then B |= ∃¯ybq(¯c; ¯y).

28

OMER MERMELSTEIN

For ¯a, we have that B |= q(¯a; ¯w) and we’ve shown that if B |= q+(¯u; ¯v) for

¯u¯v 6= ¯a ¯w, then | s(¯u¯v) ∩ s(¯a ¯w)| ≤ n, so B |= bq(¯a; ¯w) by deﬁnition.
Let ¯c ¯d ∈ A with ¯c 6= ¯a and such that A |= bq(¯c; ¯d). Assume that B |= ¬bq(¯c; ¯d).
Since r was bq-unique, it is still the case that B |= q(¯c; ¯d). So it must be that
B |= q+(¯u; ¯v) for some ¯u¯v ∈ A with | s(¯c ¯d) ∩ s(¯u¯v)| > n. But we’ve seen that in that
case, also A |= q+(¯u; ¯v) which implies A |= ¬bq(¯c; ¯d) in contradiction. So it must be
B |= bq(¯c; ¯d). This concludes the proof.

5.3. Constructing an exquisite formula. In this subsection, we prove the ex-
istence of an exquisite formula which is suitable for our needs. We do this by
inducting on the arity of the relation R∼. Therefore, we denote by Lk
∼} the
language of a symmetric k-ary relation.

∼ = {Rk

(cid:3)

Lemma 5.3.1. If for k ∈ N≥3 there exists an exquisite Lk
exists some exquisite Lk+1

∼ -formula.
Proof. Let bq(¯x; ¯y) be an exquisite Lk
∼ formula. Denote ¯a = (a1, . . . , ak), |¯y| = l,
∼-structure with universe s(¯a¯b) such that
and ¯b = (b1, . . . , bl). Let A be the Lk
A |= q(¯a; ¯b). Fix some r ∈ Rk
∼[A], say r = [t1, . . . , tk]. Since l > 2k, there are
some j1, . . . , jk+1 distinct such that for each 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1, the element bji does not
appear in r. By reordering ¯y, we may assume ji = i, hence, bi does not appear in
r for 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1.

∼-formula, then there

Let ak+1, c1, . . . , ck+1 be new elements. Deﬁne

Γ1 = {[c1, x1, . . . , xk] | [x1, . . . , xk] ∈ Rk

∼[A] \ {r}}

Γ2 = {[ak+1, bi, ci, . . . , ci+(k−1)] | 1 ≤ i ≤ +1}

where for i > (k + 1) or i < 0, we let ci = ci(mod k+1).
Consider the Lk+1

∼ -structure B deﬁned as follows:

B = {a1, . . . , ak+1, b1, . . . , bl, c1, . . . , ck+1}

Rk+1

∼ [B] = Γ1 ∪ {[c2, t1, . . . , tk]} ∪ Γ2

Claim 1. The structure B has no non-trivial automorphisms.

Proof. The element c1 is deﬁnable by virtue of being the unique element appearing
in at least |Rk
∼ [B]. This is due to bi not being such that
it appears in all relations in Rk

∼[A]| + 1 relations in Rk+1

∼[A], for any i < (k + 1).

Now, ak+1 is deﬁnable as the unique element appearing in exactly k + 1 distinct
symmetric tuples in Rk+1
∼ [B], with two of these tuples not containing c1. Hence,
the set {c1, . . . , ck+1} is deﬁnable as the set of elements appearing with ak+1 in at
least two symmetric tuples in Rk+1

So s(¯a¯b) is deﬁnable as the complement of {ak+1, c1, . . . , ck+1}, and any auto-
morphism of B induces a bijection on s(¯a¯b), which will be an automorphism of A.
Since q(¯x; ¯y) is without symmetry, A has no non-trivial automorphism. Thus, any
automorphism of B ﬁxes s(¯a¯b) pointwise.

∼ [B].

Each element of the set {c2, . . . , ck+1} is deﬁnable over {b1, . . . , bk+1}, since
we can tell apart the relations in Γ2 using the bi’s. We’ve seen that the set
{b1, . . . , bk+1} is ﬁxed pointwise by any automorphism of B, and thus so is the set
{c2, . . . , ck+1}. We conclude that the only automorphism of B is the identity. (cid:3)

Claim 2. If X ⊂ B with |X| > k + 1, then dB

0∼(B/X) < 0.

Proof. Let X 6∼ B with |X| > k + 1 be of minimal size. Showing that X = B will
∼ [X B]. Note that d0∼ (B) = dq + 1 = k. This
prove the claim. Denote RX = Rk+1
implies dB

0∼ (X) ≤ k and therefore |RX | ≥ 2.

First we show that it cannot be that RX ⊆ Γ1. Assume the contrary and denote
X ′ = X \ {c1}. By minimality of X, it must be that X ′ ⊆ s(¯a¯b). If X ′ = s(¯a¯b), then
0∼ (X) = dq + 2. If X ′ 6= s(¯a¯b), then since |X ′| > k and q(¯x; ¯y) is
by construction dB
0∼(X ′). Thus, in
intertwined, dA
any case dB

0∼ (X ′) > dq. By construction, we have dB

0∼ (X) > dq + 1 in contradiction to the self-suﬃciency of X.

0∼(X) > dA

Now we show that |X| > k + 2. Assume |X| = k + 2 to the contrary. Let
r1, r2 ∈ RX be distinct and arbitrary, then by the pigeon-hole principle r1 and
r2 have exactly k elements in common. By construction, this cannot occur unless
RX ⊆ Γ1 which we proved is impossible. So |X| > k + 2.

Now, observe that for any x ∈ X, the element x must appear in at least two
distinct symmetric tuples in RX , or else X\{x} is self-suﬃcient in B with |X\{x}| >
k + 1, in contradiction to the minimality of X.

If [c2, t1, . . . , tk] /∈ RX , then because RX * Γ1, we have RX ∩ Γ2 6= ∅.

If
[c2, t1, . . . , tk] ∈ RX , then there must be some r2 ∈ RX \ {r1} in which c2 appears.
In particular, r2 ∈ RX ∩ Γ2 and again RX ∩ Γ2 6= ∅.

In any case, it must be that ak+1 ∈ X. So there must be at least two symmetric
tuples in RX in which ak+1 appears. By construction, this means there is at most
a unique 1 ≤ j ≤ k + 1 such that cj /∈ X. Assume such a j exists. If 1 < j < k + 1,
then cj+1 ∈ X and so there are at least two symmetric tuples in RX in which cj+1
appears. There is only one symmetric tuple in B in which cj+1 appears and cj does
not, so it must be that cj appears in some tuple in RX and, therefore, cj ∈ X. If
j = 1 or j = k + 1, then the same argument applied to j − 1 shows that cj ∈ X.
We conclude that {ak+1, c1, . . . , ck+1} ⊆ X.

Since c1, c2 ∈ X, by construction, dB
Γ2, then a simple check shows that dB
0∼(X) ≥ k + 2. Thus, there must be at least
two distinct symmetric tuples in RX \ Γ2. This implies that |X ∩ s(¯a¯b)| > k. Since
0∼ (s(¯a¯b)/X ∩ s(¯a¯b)) < 0. But this cannot

We conclude that B ⊆ X.

Denote ¯c = (c1, . . . , ck+1). Let p(¯x, xk+1, ¯y, z1, . . . , zk+1) be the complete atomic
type of (¯a, ak+1, ¯b, ¯c) in B. Then p is nice by construction, without symmetry by
Claim 1, and intertwined by Claim 2. Thus, bp is an exquisite Lk+1

Lemma 5.3.2. There exists an exquisite L3

∼ formula.

Proof. Let A = {a1, a2, a3, b1, . . . , b8}. Deﬁne R as follows:

R = {[a1, b1, b2], [a2, b2, b3], [a3, b1, b7],
[a1, b3, b4], [a2, b4, b5], [a3, b8, b3],
[a1, b5, b6], [a2, b6, b7],
[a1, b7, b8]

Claim 1. The structure A has no non-trivial automorphisms.

OMER MERMELSTEIN

Proof. The element a1 is deﬁnable as it is the only element present in four distinct
tuples in R. Then, a2 and a3 are deﬁnable for not being with a1 in the same tuple
in R, and being present in two and three tuples in R, respectively.

The set {b1, b8} is now deﬁnable by the property of not being in a tuple with a2
in R. Thus, b7 is deﬁnable as the unique element sharing a tuple in R both with
b1 and with b8. Clearly all other elements are deﬁnable over a1, a2, a3, b7. Since all
the elements of A are deﬁnable, any automorphism of A is trivial.
(cid:3)

Claim 2. If X ⊂ A with |X| > 3, then dA

0∼(A/X) < 0.

Proof. Let X 6∼ A with |X| > 3 and such that X is of minimal size. Showing that
∼[X A]. A brief examination shows
X = A will prove the claim. Denote RX = R3
that it must be that |X| > 4. Thus, any x ∈ X is present in at least two tuples in
RX , or else (X \ {x}) 6∼ A in contradiction to the minimality of X.

By this reasoning, we have

a3 /∈ X =⇒ b1, b8 /∈ X =⇒ b2, b7 /∈ X =⇒ a2 /∈ X =⇒ b4, b5, b6 /∈ X

so it must be that a3 ∈ X. As explained, both tuples in R involving a3 are in
RX , and consequently b1, b3, b7, b8 ∈ X. Again, since b1 ∈ X it must be that
[a1, b1, b2] ∈ RX implying a1, b2 ∈ X. Because b2 ∈ X, it must be [a2, b2, b3] ∈ RX
and a2 ∈ X. We have so far A \ {b4, b5, b6} ⊆ X ⊆ A. A brief calculation shows
that if X 6= A, then dA
0∼(X) > 2. As d0∼ (A) = 2 and X 6∼ A, this cannot be. (cid:3)
Denote ¯a = (a1, a2, a3), ¯b = (b1, . . . , b8). Let q(¯x; ¯y) be the complete atomic type

Corollary 5.3.3. Let k ∈ N≥3. There exists an exquisite Lk

∼ formula bq(¯x; ¯y).

Proof. The proof is by induction on k. For the base case k = 3, the previous

then exactly Lemma 5.3.1.

Lemma guarantees the existence of such a formula bq(¯x; ¯y). The induction step is

of M to L∼ ∪ L6∼ where

M+ |= ∀¯x(R6∼(¯x) ↔ ∃¯ybq(¯x; ¯y))

and denote M(bq) = M+ ↾ L6∼.
We will show that M6∼ ∼= M∼
(bq) is a proper reduct of M∼. For the
remainder of this section we use the deﬁnitions and results of Subsection 3.6 with

(bq) and that M∼

respect to our choice of bq.
Lemma 5.4.1. The relation 6∼ encloses reducts.
Proof. Let A 6∼ M where age(M) ⊆ C∼. Let ¯a ∈ A be arbitrary.
0∼ (s(¯b)/ s(¯a)) = −1, there is
Assume ¯b ∈ M is such that M |= bq(¯a; ¯b). Because dM
some b ∈ s(¯b) in the self-suﬃcient closure of s(¯a) in M. Since q is intertwined we
have that s(¯a¯b) is in the self-suﬃcient closure of s(¯ab), and thus in the self-suﬃcient
closure of s(¯a). Since s(¯a) ⊆ A, we get s(¯b) ⊆ A. Clearly, M |= ψq(¯a; ¯b) implies
A |= ψq(¯a; ¯b), so A |= bq(¯a; ¯b).

Now assume ¯b ∈ A such that A |= bq(¯a; ¯b). Clearly M |= q(¯a; ¯b), so we only need
to show M |= ψq(¯a; ¯b). Assume not, let ¯c ¯d ∈ M be such that ¯a¯b 6= ¯c ¯d, M |= q(¯c; ¯d)
and | s(¯a¯b) ∩ s(¯c ¯d)| > n. Since q is intertwined, s(¯c ¯d) is in the self-suﬃcient closure
of s(¯a¯b), and so in A. So A |= ¬ψq(¯a; ¯b) in contradiction. So our assumption was
wrong, and M |= bq(¯a; ¯b).

We conclude that A(bq) |= R6∼(¯a) if and only if M(bq) |= R6∼(¯a).

(cid:3)

Lemma 5.4.2. If A ∈ C∼ then A(bq) ∈ C6∼.

Proof. Assume that the statement is false. So there exists some A, an L∼-structure
with A ∈ C∼ and A(bq) /∈ C6∼. Choose A such that wA is minimal. We claim that
cA = 0. If not, then by Lemma 5.2.17 there is some B ∈ C∼ with wB < wA and
R6∼(A(bq)) ⊆ R6∼(B(bq)). Clearly, since A(bq) /∈ C6∼, also B(bq) /∈ C6∼ in contradiction to
the minimality condition on A.
06∼ (X) < 0. Denote T = {¯a¯b | ¯a ∈ X, A |= bq(¯a; ¯b)}
and let ¯X = X ∪ S¯a¯b∈T s(¯b). Since there are no collisions in A, if ¯a¯b and ¯c ¯d are
distinct with A |= bq(¯a; ¯b) ∧ bq(¯c; ¯d), then Gq(¯a; ¯b) and Gq(¯c; ¯d) are disjoint. We thus

This contradicts our assumption that A ∈ C∼. Since we proved that a structure
such as A cannot exist, the statement of the lemma holds.
(cid:3)

Lemma 5.4.3. (C∼, d0∼) has a mixed amalgam with (C6∼, d06∼).

Proof. Let A ∈ C∼ and let B ∈ C6∼ with A(bq) 66∼ B. Denote T = R6∼(B/A(bq)). For
each ¯a ∈ T let ¯w¯a be a tuple of distinct elements not appearing in B. Consider the
L∼-structure C with

C = B ∪ [
R∼[C] = R∼[A] ∪ [

First we would like to assert that A 6∼ C. Let X 6∼ C be arbitrary, denote
0∼(X) ≥ 0. Note that for
0∼(s(¯a ¯w¯a)/X) ≤ 0, so we may assume

XA = X ∩ A, XB = X ∩ B. We will show that dC
any ¯a ∈ T , if | s(¯a ¯w¯a) ∩ X| ≥ n, then dC

06∼ (XB/XA) ≥ 0

Combining this with the fact dC
0∼(X) ≥ 0. So
A 6∼ C and by transitivity of 6∼, also C ∈ C∼. We only have left to show that
B 66∼ C(bq).

0∼ (XA) ≥ 0 we get dC

0∼ (XA) = dA

Let ¯c ¯d ∈ C be such that C |= q+(¯c; ¯d). We show that either ¯c ∈ T and ¯d = ¯w¯c, or
s(¯c ¯d) ⊆ A. Assume that the latter is false, then Gq(¯c; ¯d) * R∼[A]. By construction,
this must mean that s(¯c ¯d) intersects s( ¯w¯a) for some ¯a ∈ T . As C is a simple
amalgam of (C \ s( ¯w¯a))C and s(¯a ¯w¯a)C over s(¯a)C, by Lemma 5.2.16, it must be that
s(¯c ¯d) ⊆ s(¯a ¯w¯a). Since q is without symmetry, ¯c ¯d = ¯a ¯w¯a.
It is immediate from the above paragraph that R6∼

C( bq) (C/A) ⊆ R6∼(B). Addi-
C( bq) (A) and ¯b is such that C |= bq(¯a; ¯b), then already
A |= bq(¯a; ¯b), meaning ¯a ∈ R6∼(B). We have shown that s(¯b) ⊆ A must be, and
then it is clear that A |= q(¯a; ¯b). Our claim follows from the observation that, by
construction, A |= ¬ψq(¯a; ¯b) implies C |= ¬ψq(¯a; ¯b). Thus, R6∼(C(bq)) ⊆ R6∼(B).

tionally, we claim that if ¯a ∈ R6∼

Now, showing R6∼(B) ⊆ R6∼(C(bq)) gives us B ⊆ C(bq) and thereby B 66∼ C(bq). If
¯a ∈ T , it is clear by what we’ve shown that C |= bq(¯a; ¯w¯a) and therefore ¯a ∈ R6∼(C(bq)).
Thus, let ¯a ∈ R6∼(A(bq)), and let ¯b ∈ A be such that A |= bq(¯a; ¯b). By construction,
C |= q(¯a; ¯b).
If ¯cd ∈ C is such that | s(¯a¯b) ∩ s(¯c ¯d)| > n and C |= q+(¯c; ¯d), then
as we’ve seen s(¯c ¯d) ⊆ A, but by construction this would mean A |= q+(¯c; ¯d), in
contradiction to A |= ψq(¯a; ¯b). So no such ¯c ¯d exist and therefore C |= bq(¯a; ¯b). In

particular, ¯a ∈ R6∼(C(bq)). So we have shown R6∼(B) ⊆ R6∼(C(bq)).

We proved A 6∼ C and B 66∼ C(bq), so C is a structure as required in the deﬁnition
(cid:3)

of a mixed amalgam.
Lemma 5.4.4. (C∼, d0∼) is benign towards (C6∼, d06∼).
Proof. Let F ∈ C∼. Let ¯a be an n-tuple of distinct elements not in F and let
A = F ∪ s(¯a). Deﬁne R1 = R∼[F ] and R2 = R∼[F ] ∪ {[¯a]}. Let Ai be the
L∼-structure with universe A and R∼[Ai] = Ri. Clearly F 6∼ Ai for i ∈ {1, 2}
and A1 is not isomorphic to A2 over F . Since Ai is a simple amalgam of F and
s(¯a)Ai over the empty set, by Lemma 5.2.16, if Ai |= q+(¯c; ¯d), then s(¯c ¯d) ⊆ F . So
R6∼(Ai(bq)) = R6∼(F(bq)) for i ∈ {1, 2} and therefore A1(bq) = A2(bq). In particular,
A1(bq) is isomorphic to A2(bq) over F . So A1 and A2 are as required by the deﬁnition
of benignity.
(cid:3)
Theorem 5.4.5. The structure M6∼ is isomorphic to a proper reduct of M∼.
Proof. All conditions of Proposition 3.6.7 and Lemma 3.6.9 hold with respect to
(C∼, d0∼) and (C6∼, d06∼ ). Thus, M∼
(cid:3)
Corollary 5.4.6. For any g, h ≤ Sn, the structure Mg is isomorphic to a proper
reduct of Mh.
Proof. By Theorem 5.1.6, Mg is isomorphic to a reduct of M∼. By Theorem 5.4.5,
M∼ is isomorphic to a proper reduct of M6∼. By Theorem 5.1.6 again, M6∼ is
isomorphic to a reduct of Mh.
(cid:3)

(bq) is a proper reduct and M6∼ ∼= M∼
(bq).
