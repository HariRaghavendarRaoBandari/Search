Abstract

It has been proposed that during the early steps in the origin of life, small droplets could have formed

via the segregation of molecules from complex mixtures by phase separation. These droplets could have

provided chemical reaction centers. However, whether these droplets could divide and propagate is un-

clear. Here we examine the behavior of droplets in systems that are maintained away from thermodynamic

equilibrium by an external supply of energy. In these systems, droplets grow by the addition of droplet

material generated by chemical reactions. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that chemically driven droplet growth can

lead to shape instabilities that trigger the division of droplets into two smaller daughters. Therefore, chemi-

cally active droplets can exhibit cycles of growth and division that resemble the proliferation of living cells.

Dividing active droplets could serve as a model for prebiotic protocells, where chemical reactions in the

droplet play the role of a prebiotic metabolism.

Introduction Living systems consist of cells that can grow and divide. Cells take up matter
from the outside world to grow, they release waste products, and they are able to divide, creating
more cells. A fundamental question is to understand how cells arose early in evolution. Early in the
origin of life, chemical reaction centers or chemical micro reactors had to form in order to organize
chemical reactions in space. These micro reactors had to exchange material with the outside and
they had to propagate. Recently, the idea of Oparin and Haldane1,2 that small droplets, which they
called coacervates, could organize molecules in micro reactors has resurfaced to prominence3–8.
Such droplets are liquid-like aggregates that concentrate molecules that have separated from a
complex mixture.

Liquid droplets are self-organized structures that coexist with a surrounding ﬂuid7,9. The inter-
face separating the two coexisting phases provides them with a well deﬁned surface. The associ-
ated surface tension forces them into a spherical shape. Furthermore, many substances can diffuse
across the interface. The segregation of components into a droplet concentrates material in a con-
ﬁned volume, which may facilitate speciﬁc chemical reactions. Thus droplets provide containers
in which chemical reactions can be spatially organized. Although the thermodynamics of phase
transitions can explain how liquid drops can form, it is unclear how such droplets could propagate
by division and subsequent growth, an ability that would be key at the origin of life.

Droplets grow by taking up material from a supersaturated environment or by Ostwald ripen-
ing9–13. Ostwald ripening describes the exchange of material between droplets by diffusion, usu-
ally leading to growth of large droplets while small droplets shrink. Furthermore, droplets can
increase in size by fusion of two droplets into a larger one. These processes lead to the formation
of droplets of increasing size while the droplet number decreases with time. This behavior is op-
posite to that of cells which have a characteristic size and increase their number by division. How
could droplets divide and propagate?

We have recently shown that droplets that are maintained away from thermodynamic equilib-
rium by a chemical fuel can have unusual properties14,15. In particular, in the presence of chemical
reactions, Ostwald ripening can be suppressed15 and multiple droplets can stably coexist, with a
characteristic size set by the reaction rates15–18. Here, we show that surprisingly, spherical droplets
subject to chemical reactions spontaneously split in two smaller daughter droplets of equal size.
Therefore, chemically active droplets can grow and subsequently divide and thereby propagate by
using up the inﬂowing material as a fuel. We conclude that droplets can indeed behave similarly
to cells in the presence of chemical reactions that are driven by an external fuel reservoir. Such

2

active droplets could represent models for growing and dividing protocells with a rudimentary
metabolism which is represented by simple chemical reactions that are maintained by an external
fuel.

Division of active droplets Droplets can serve as small compartments to spatially organize
chemical reactions. The emergence of droplets requires phase separation into two coexisting liq-
uid phases of different composition. Phase separation is driven by molecular interactions, where
molecules with an afﬁnity for each other lower their energy if they come closely together. A ﬂuid
can demix if the energy decrease associated with molecular interactions overcomes the effects of
entropy increase by mixing19,20. If those interactions are strong, a sharp interface separates the
coexisting phases.

Droplets can become chemically active if the material of the droplet is produced and destroyed
by chemical reactions. An example that resembles a simple protocell is shown schematically in
Fig. 1A. The droplet is formed by a droplet material D that is generated inside the droplet from a
high energy precursor N, which plays the role of a nutrient. Droplet material can degrade into a
lower energy component W that plays the role of a waste, which leaves the droplet by diffusion.
The droplet can survive if N is continuously supplied and W is continuously removed. This can
be achieved by recycling N using an external energy source such as a fuel or radiation.

Inspired by Oparin21, we discuss the physics of such active droplets using a minimal model
with only two components A and B, see Fig. 1B. The droplet material B phase separates from the
solvent. It can spontaneously be degraded by a chemical reaction

B → A

(1)

into molecules of type A that are soluble in the background ﬂuid and leave the droplet. The
backward reaction A → B is not proceeding spontaneously because B is of higher energy than A.
New droplet material B can be produced by the second reaction

A + C → B + C(cid:48) ,

(2)

that is coupled to a fuel C. Here C(cid:48) is the low energy reaction product of the fuel molecules. The
chemical potential difference ∆µC = µC − µC(cid:48) > 0 provided by the fuel powers the production
of high energy B from low energy A. The difference ∆µC can be maintained constant if the
concentrations of C and C(cid:48) are set by an external reservoir. In this case, the system is kept away
from a thermodynamic equilibrium, see Box 1.

Inside the droplet, N is transformed to D by chemical reactions. Droplet material D is degraded chemically

into low energy waste W that leaves the droplet. B) Minimal model, with droplet material B and soluble

equations of a continuum model corresponding to the situation shown in B) were solved numerically. The

droplet shapes are shown as equal concentration contours (black). Parameter values are ν−t0/∆c = 7·10−3,
ν+t0/∆c = 1.9 · 10−3, and k±t0 = 10−2, where t0 is a characteristic time of the continuum model (see
supplementary information). Indicated times are given in units of 102 t0.

The combination of phase separation and non-equilibrium chemical reactions can be studied in
a continuum model15–17, see supplemental information. Using this model, we ﬁnd that spherical
droplets that are chemically active can undergo a shape instability and split in two smaller droplets,
despite their surface tension, see Fig. 1C. A droplet ﬁrst grows until it reaches its stationary size15.
Then, the droplet starts to elongate and forms a dumbbell shape. This dumbbell splits in two
smaller droplets of equal size. The resulting smaller droplets grow again until a new division may

In order to investigate the stability of spherical droplets, we study the droplet shape by an
effective droplet model described in Box 215. Fig. 2A shows the behavior of the stationary droplet
radius in this model as a function of the supersaturation . This supersaturation is the excess
concentration of droplet material far from the droplet, generated by the chemical reaction (2). For
 > 0, material diffuses to the droplet and is incorporated. Fig. 2A shows that for a given turnover
ν− of droplet material inside the droplet (see Box 2), stationary droplets only exist for sufﬁciently
large supersaturation. Beyond this threshold, droplets smaller than the critical radius (Fig. 2A,
black dotted lines) shrink, while larger droplets grow toward the stationary radius (Fig. 2A, black
solid line)15. At this stationary radius, the inﬂux of B due to supersaturation outside is balanced
by the efﬂux of material A produced inside the droplet. Thus a larger turnover leads to smaller
droplets (Fig. 2A).

Droplet division occurs when a spherical droplet becomes unstable and elongates. We per-
formed a linear stability analysis of spherical droplets at their stationary radius in the effective
droplet model, see supplemental material. We ﬁnd that for increasing supersaturation , a spher-
ical droplet with surface tension undergoes a shape instability when its radius reaches a critical
value Rdiv that depends on the reaction rates and droplet parameters, see Fig. 2A. Beyond the ra-
dius Rdiv, the spherical shape is unstable and any small shape deformation triggers the elongation
of the droplet shape along one axis.

The stability analysis of the effective droplet model can be represented in a state diagram, see
Fig. 2B. We ﬁnd three different regions as a function of supersaturation  and turnover of droplet
material ν−. A region where droplets do not exist (white), a region in which spherical droplets are
stable (blue), and a region in which spherical droplets are unstable (red).

In order to study how the shape instability leads to droplet division, we investigated the droplet
dynamics beyond the linearized analysis using the continuum model. This model can capture the
topological changes of the droplet surface that occur during division. Numerical calculations of
the continuum model (see supplemental information) conﬁrm the results of the stability analysis.
An example of droplet division is shown in Fig. 1C. The state diagram for the continuum model
is shown in Fig. 2C. Comparing the state diagrams Fig. 2B and Fig. 2C reveals that both models
exhibit qualitatively the same behaviors. Note that due to simpliﬁcations in the effective droplet
model, the parameters are different in both models (see supplemental information) and the regions
in both diagrams differ slightly. While Fig. 2B only shows where droplets become unstable (red

line), Fig. 2C reveals the behaviors of droplets in the unstable region. We ﬁnd that droplets typ-
ically divide into two daughters (red circles). However, for some parameter values they divide
into three droplets (red triangles). Our calculations show that droplets typically divide after they
become unstable. However, in some cases division was not seen during the time of calculations
(red rectangles). In these cases droplets elongated until they reaches the size of the simulation box.
It is unclear whether they would divide in a larger box.

Fig. 3A and supplemental movie. After a ﬁrst division, the smaller daughters grow until they di-
vide again when they reach the radius Rdiv. Interestingly, the division axes are not independent of
each other, see Fig. 3A. In the absence of system boundaries, the division axes of both daughters
are perpendicular to the ﬁrst division axis, see Fig. 3B. Similarly, when the four granddaughters
divide, their division axes are perpendicular to both the division axes of the ﬁrst and the second
division. The division axes in subsequent droplet divisions are determined by droplet interac-
tions via the concentration ﬁelds surrounding the droplets. The two growing daughter droplets
effectively compete for droplet material, leading to the depletion of droplet material in the space
between them. Therefore, diffusion ﬂuxes and growth rates are larger along axes perpendicular to
the previous division axis, see Fig. 3C. This bias due to droplet interactions determines the divi-
sion axes. In our numerical calculations, boundary conditions also inﬂuence the droplet divisions
and slightly modify the division axes, see Fig. 3A.

Discussion The question how life ﬁrst arose on earth has fascinated both scientists and non-
scientists since it was understood that modern life emerged by evolution from early precursors.
While evolution can be reconstructed to a large extend both from fossil records and from the phy-
logenetic analysis of todays genomes, the structure and nature of early life forms remain quite
unclear22. How did the ﬁrst replicating cells emerge from prebiotic precursors? Since replication
involves speciﬁc chemical reactions, early replicators had to spatially organize chemistry and to
concentrate certain molecules to facilitate reactions that would be unlikely in dilute or disorganized
situations. Therefore, protocells as containers for chemical reactions had to appear.

Alexander Oparin pioneered the idea that macromolecular aggregation could lead to the forma-
tion of ’coacervates’, liquid droplets that could organize chemistry and provide microreactors in
which selected molecules were concentrated for prebiotic chemistry1,23. What types of molecules
could have formed such droplets? It is interesting to note that modern day cells possess a number
of chemical compartments that are not separated by a membrane from the cell cytoplasm but that
form by phase separation from the cytoplasm3,7,24,25. Many of these compartments are liquid and
consist of RNA molecules and RNA binding proteins26–29. The RNA world hypothesis suggests
that at the origin of life, RNA was both the carrier of genetic information and could have acted as
early enzymes30,31. Folded RNA molecules called ribozymes can be catalysts for many reactions
including RNA processing32. Combining RNA with other molecules such as simple peptides may
have been sufﬁcient to organize RNA in liquid droplets4.

8

The steps from chemically active droplets to the ﬁrst dividing cells with membranes pose a big
challenge to the understanding of early evolution. While it has been suggested that ribozymes that
replicate RNA could have formed by molecular evolution31,33, it is unclear how a cell membrane
and cell division could have emerged34–37.

The possibility that droplets may spontaneously divide has been discussed in the context of
either negative surface tension38,39 or in active nematic droplets40. Here we show that simply
adding a proto-metabolism to droplets formed by classical phase separation can naturally lead to
droplet division despite their surface tension. Membranes or surfactants are therefore not required
to achieve division of prebiotic cells. Active droplets are natural systems to organize the chemistry
of replicators and to form protocells. Such droplets can in principle form spontaneously by a rare
nucleation event. Once they exist, they grow and divide. They provide a container for chemical
reactions and they concentrate selected molecules that have an afﬁnity to the droplet phase. The
liquid and dynamic nature of active droplets implies that components in the droplet can mix and
chemical reactions are facilitated. Protocells formed by active droplets require a constant energy
supply, which could have been provided by a chemical fuel, by tides, or by temperature gradients,
e.g. in hydrothermal vents on the sea ﬂoor2,41–43. The chemical reactions by which new droplet
material is formed and subsequently degraded represents an early metabolism.

The fact that active droplets tend to become unstable and divide is a very unusual behavior of
droplets. Usually, droplets maintain their spherical shape because surface tension tends to reduce
the surface area. An instability of the droplet shape requires non-equilibrium conditions. In our
models, the chemically driven diffusion ﬂuxes associated with stationary droplets trigger the shape
instability. In the absence of chemical reactions and stationary ﬂuxes, the shape instability does
not occur. This is reminiscent of other well known shape instabilities of moving interfaces. The
droplet instability discussed here that triggers droplet division is related to the Mullins-Sekerka
instability often discussed in the context of crystal growth44. In the case of the Mullins-Sekerka
instability, an interface advances because of a diffusive inﬂux. Beyond a critical interface velocity,
a ﬂat interface becomes unstable with respect to growing spikes called dendrites. The Mullins-
Sekerka instability occurs for a moving interface in the absence of chemical reactions, while the
active droplet instability discussed here requires reactions but no interface motion. In the limit
of large characteristic length scales introduced by the chemical reactions, the conditions for both
instabilities become the same (supplemental information).

We propose that active droplets that are maintained away from thermodynamic equilibrium by

9

a constant inﬂux of nutrients and a constant efﬂux of waste are a simple model of membraneless
protocells. One can speculate that such droplets could have concentrated RNA molecules together
with other molecular species to form early replicators with an early metabolism. It is interesting to
envision early ecosystems in which droplets of different type may have had symbiotic relationships
if one produces the nutrient of the other. Alternatively one can ﬁnd predator-prey relationships
when a droplet fuses with a different one to harvests its resources.

Finally, the possibility that early protocells were active droplets suggest possible scenarios
by which cell membranes and cells with a more modern architecture could have emerged. The
droplet surface is an interface that will in general attract amphiphilic molecules. Such molecules
have neither an afﬁnity for the droplet phase nor for the surrounding ﬂuid. As a result, selected
molecules populate the droplet surface and surface chemical reactions could be established. Such
surface modiﬁcations could improve the resistance of droplets to varying environmental conditions
and provide speciﬁc surface properties. If lipids were available in the outside ﬂuid, lipid bilayers
could be attracted to the speciﬁc droplet surface chemistry. Our work shows that active droplets
can naturally divide. Therefore protocells could have obtained their membranes long after the ﬁrst
dividing cells had appeared on earth.

Growth and Division of Active Droplets: A Model for Protocells

I. CONTINUUM MODEL FOR ACTIVE DROPLETS

A. Free energy function and chemical rates

We consider an incompressible ﬂuid containing two components: a component A that forms
the background ﬂuid and a droplet material B that forms droplets by phase separation. Chemical
reactions convert the two components into each other.

The concentration of the droplet material B is denoted by c(r, t) where r is the position and t
denotes time. The concentration of the second component can be determined from c using the in-
compressibility condition. Therefore, the free energy density f only depends on the concentration
c. We use the following double-well free energy function

f (c) =

(S.1)

where we have deﬁned ∆c =(cid:12)(cid:12)c(0)− − c(0)

interactions and entropic contributions. This free energy describes the segregation of the ﬂuid in
two coexisting phases46: one phase rich in droplet material with c ≈ c(0)− and a diluted phase with
c ≈ c(0)
+ .

The state of the system is characterized by the free energy

(S.2)

where the integral is over the system volume. Here, the coefﬁcient κ is related to surface tension
and the interface width47. The chemical potential ¯µ = δF [c]/δc, which governs demixing, reads

¯µ =

The dynamics of the concentration ﬁeld is described by the reaction-diffusion equation17,48

∂tc = m∇2 ¯µ + s(c) .

(S.3)

(S.4)

Here, m is a mobility coefﬁcient of the droplet material. The source term s(c) describes chemical
reactions.

We choose the function s(c) to be linear in the phases outside and inside the droplet. We

connect these linear behaviors by a cubic interpolating polynomial:

The reaction ﬂux given in Eq. (S.5) describes a situation where an external energy source drives
the system away from equilibrium, see Box 1. Eqs. (S.3)–(S.5) deﬁne the continuum model of
active droplets.

B. Relation with the effective droplet model

The model described by Eq. (S.4) typically forms distinct phases, which are separated by an
interface. Considering a ﬂat interface between two phases with bulk concentrations c = c(0)− and
c = c(0)

+ , the free energy F given in Eq. (S.2) is minimized by the concentration proﬁle

√κb .

(S.8)

Two different bulk concentrations c− and c+ coexist across the interface for which the chemical
potential is equal on both sides. For a curved interface the pressure difference between the inside

17

and outside of the droplet is the Laplace pressure 2γH, where H is the mean curvature of the
interface. These two equilibrium conditions read

0 = ¯µ(c−) − ¯µ(c+)
0 = (c− − c+)¯µ(c−) + f (c+) − f (c−) − 2γH ,

(S.9a)

(S.9b)

where c− and c+ denote the concentration at the interface inside and outside the droplet, respec-
tively. Using the free energy density as deﬁned in Eq. (S.1), the concentrations that obey Eqs. (S.9)
can be expressed to ﬁrst order in H as

c− ≈ c(0)− + βγH
c+ ≈ c(0)
+ + βγH ,

(S.10a)

(S.10b)

which is valid for small surface tension, γ (cid:28) R∆c/β. Here, the coefﬁcient β = 2/(b∆c) describes
the effect of Laplace pressure on the concentration at the interface. Note that γβ deﬁnes a length
scale, which is related to the interface width by γβ = w∆c/6. Linearizing Eq. (S.4) at the values
c(0)
+ and c(0)− outside and inside the droplet gives the linear reaction-diffusion equation deﬁned in
Box 2, with diffusivity D = mb.

We thus can relate the parameters b, κ, and m of the continuous theory to the parameters γ, β±,

and D± of the effective droplet model. In particular, β+ = β− = β, and D+ = D− = D.

C. Numerical methods

We solved Eq. (S.4) with (S.5) and (S.3) numerically using the xmds2 software package (ver-
sion 2.2.2)49 using an adaptive Runge-Kutta scheme of order 4/5, with tolerance 10−5. The Laplace
operator was evaluated by a spectral method, while the chemical rates were evaluated directly. Nu-
merical calculations were performed in a ﬁnite volume with no ﬂux boundary conditions.

We normalize concentration, length and time by ∆c = c(0)− − c(0)

+ , w and t0 = w2/D, re-
spectively, where the characteristic length scale is w = 2(κ/b)1/2. The relevant dimensionless
model parameters are c(0)± /∆c, k±t0, ν±t0/∆c and c±
c /∆c. In all numerical calculations, we chose
+ /∆c = 0, c(0)− /∆c = 1 and k±t0 = 10−2.

Stability diagram

Using three dimensional calculations in Cartesian coordinates, we observed that droplet con-
ﬁgurations during the division of isolated single droplets were approximately axisymmetric. To
determine the stability diagram shown in Fig. 2C we therefore performed calculations in cylindri-
cal coordinates imposing axisymmetry. We used an axisymmetric cylindrical box with length 60w
and radius 30w, discretized with 120 and 60 points, respectively.

The initial conditions were given by a concentration proﬁle that corresponded to a droplet
geometry of a slightly prolate ellipsoid with unequal half axes with length R/w − 0.1 and R/w +
0.1, centered at the box center. The initial droplet size was chosen close to the stationary size in
the continuum model. As an estimate for the stationary size we typically chose R/w = 0.9 ¯Rs/ ˆw.
Here, ¯Rs is the stationary radius calculated in the effective droplet model and ˆw = 6β+γ/∆c, see
Section I B. The concentration ﬁeld at positions r was initialized by the function

(S.11)

where d(r) is the oriented distance of r to the nearest point on the ellipsoid. The value of d(r) is
negative for points inside the droplet and positive for points outside. The concentration far from
the droplet is c∞ = ν+/k+ + c(0)
+ .

We calculated the dynamics of the concentration ﬁeld over a time interval T /t0 = 104, for
different values of ν±t0/∆c. The parameters c±
related to the chemical reaction in Eq. (S.5)
c /∆c = 0.75. Because close to the shape instability the
were chosen as c+
dynamics slows down, we may slightly overestimate the region of stability, since we cannot detect
the exact instability with the ﬁnite time intervals simulated. Contours shown in Fig. 1C correspond
to c/∆c = 0.5.

c /∆c = 0.25 and c−

2. Calculations for multiple divisions

Several subsequent divisions break cylindrical symmetry. The calculations shown in Fig. 3A
were therefore performed in three dimensions using cartesian coordinates. We chose a cubic box
with side length L = 50w and an equidistant discretization of 100 points along each dimension.

Initial conditions corresponded to a spherical droplet centered at r = (L/4, L/4, L/4). The
concentration ﬁeld was initialized with c = c(0)− inside the droplet and c = c∞ outside. The

19

parameters for the calculations were ν−t0/∆c = 7 · 10−3, ν+t0/∆c = 2 · 10−3 and c+

c /∆c = 0.5. Surfaces shown in Fig. 3A correspond to c/∆c = 0.5.

II. EFFECTIVE MODEL FOR ACTIVE DROPLETS

Using the effective droplet model deﬁned in Box 2, we discuss steady state droplets and perform
a linear stability analysis of the spherical droplet shape. We determine conditions for a shape
instability towards an elongated shape.

A. Droplet dynamics in spherical coordinates

Using spherical coordinates r, θ, φ centered on the droplet, the interface deﬁning the droplet
surface is positioned at radial distance r = R(θ, φ). Away from the interface, the concentration
ﬁeld c(r, θ, φ) obeys the reaction-diffusion equation

∂tc = D±∇2c + s .

(S.12)

Here, t denotes time and D+, D− are the diffusion coefﬁcients outside (r > R(θ, φ)) and inside
(r < R(θ, φ)) the droplet, respectively. The reaction ﬂux s is given by

s =

ν+ − k+(c+ − c(0)
+ )
−ν− − k−(c − c(0)− )

for

r > R

for

r < R

.

(S.13)

Here, reaction rates inside and outside the droplet are denoted by k±, c(0)± denote the equilibrium
bulk concentrations of coexisting phases near a planar interface. The reaction ﬂuxes at equilibrium
concentrations are denoted by ν±. For the concentration c = c0, with c0 = −ν−/k− + c(0)− , the
reaction ﬂux inside the droplet vanishes, while for c = c∞ with c∞ = ν+/k+ + c(0)
+ the reaction
ﬂux outside the droplet vanishes.

At the interface at r = R(θ, φ) we impose boundary conditions for the concentration:

c(R±) = c(0)± + β±γH(θ, φ) .

(S.14)

This boundary condition describes a concentration jump at the interface. It corresponds to local
thermodynamic equilibrium at a curved interface with surface tension γ. Here, R± denote the

20

limits of approaching the interface at radial distance R(θ, φ) from the outside or the inside, re-
spectively. The mean curvature of the interface is denoted H and the coefﬁcients β± describe the
change of the equilibrium concentration at the interface due to Laplace pressure 2γH.

The normal velocity vn of the interface is proportional to the difference of normal ﬂuxes inside

and outside9,

vn = n ·

j− − j+

c(R−) − c(R+)

with ﬂux j± = −D±∇c(R±) and unit vector n normal to the interface. The droplet shape

R(θ, φ) = R(θ, φ)er, where er denotes the unit vector in radial direction, can be parameterized
using the angles θ and φ. The interface velocity can be written as

,

(S.15)

∂R(θ, φ, t)

∂t

= vθe1 + vφe2 + vnn ,

(S.16)

where e1 = ∂R/∂θ and e2 = ∂R/∂φ are the two basis vectors of the tangential plane. Using
∂R/∂t = (∂R/∂t)er, the velocity components vθ and vφ can be obtained from the conditions
(∂R/∂t)eθ = 0 and (∂R/∂t)eφ = 0. Here, eθ and eφ are the local normalized basis vectors cor-
responding to θ and φ in spherical coordinates. The radial interface velocity ∂R/∂t = (∂R/∂t)·er
then reads

= vn(cid:34)1 +(cid:18)∂θR

vn and the droplet radius R in a quasi-static limit. Steady state droplets exist for radii R = ¯R for
which dR/dt vanishes. These stationary radii thus obey

j+( ¯R) = j−( ¯R) .

(S.22)

Fig. S1 shows an example of dR/dt as a function of R in the presence (red line) and absence
(blue line) of chemical reactions. If chemical reactions are present, two steady state radii denoted
¯Rc (white circle) and ¯Rs (black circle) exist, corresponding to a critical nucleation radius and a
stationary droplet radius, respectively. Both stationary radii are shown in Fig. 2A in the main text.

The critical radius estimated by Eq. (S.23) is closely related to the classical expression for the
critical nucleation radius of passive droplets. In the case of active droplets, the supersaturation
 = (c∞ − c(0)
+ )/∆c is determined by chemical reactions instead of the amount of material pro-
vided. The stationary droplet radius given in Eq. (S.24) describes an inherently non-equilibrium
stationary state that is maintained by opposing ﬂuxes15.

C. Stability analysis of the spherical droplet shape

To analyze the linear stability of the stationary droplets, we linearize the dynamic equations in
the vicinity of the stationary state and identify the dynamic eigenmodes. The stationary state is
unstable with respect to a dynamic mode if the corresponding growth rate is positive.

1. Linearization at the stationary solution

We linearize the dynamic equations (S.12)–(S.15) and (S.17) around a stationary solution ¯c(r),
which obeys Eqs. (S.18)–(S.22). Introducing small perturbations δc and δR of the concentration

23

ﬁeld and the droplet shape, respectively, we write

and

c(r, θ, ϕ, t) = ¯c(r) + δc(r, θ, ϕ, t) ,

R(θ, ϕ, t) = ¯R + δR(θ, ϕ, t) .

The concentration perturbation then obeys

The boundary conditions (S.14) become

∂tδc = D±∇2δc − k±δc .

δc( ¯R±) = β±γδH − ¯c(cid:48)( ¯R±)δR ,

(S.25)

(S.26)

(S.27)

(S.28)

where δH = H( ¯R + δR) − H( ¯R). Using Eqs. (S.15) and (S.17), the time dependence of the
droplet shape perturbation is described to linear order by

(c(0)− − c(0)

+ )∂tδR = D+∂rδc( ¯R+) − D−∂rδc( ¯R−) +(cid:2)D+¯c(cid:48)(cid:48)( ¯R+) − D−¯c(cid:48)(cid:48)( ¯R−)(cid:3) δR .

(S.29)

2. Dynamic modes and relaxation spectrum

The linearized dynamics of droplet perturbations near the steady state deﬁnes a linear operator

L by

The operator L has eigenfunctions (ci, Ri)(cid:124) with corresponding eigenvalues µi, where i is the
mode index. These modes obey

The linear droplet dynamics can thus be decomposed in eigenmodes with amplitude Ai as

where the sum is over all eigenmodes. Thus, the eigenfunctions of L correspond to dynamic
modes of the system. For µi < 0, the values −µi are relaxation rates. The steady state is stable if
all µi < 0.

where Ylm are spherical harmonics and the corresponding eigenvalues will be denoted µnl. Using

Using λ±
nl = ((k± + µnl)/D±)1/2, Eq. (S.42) becomes an implicit equation for the unknown eigen-
values µnl. This equation typically has either no solution or one solution. We identify the largest
eigenvalue for given l with n = 1.

In order to determine the full spectrum µnl of eigenmodes, we have to consider the case
µnl < −k±. We then deﬁne (λ±
nl)2 = −(k± + µnl)/D± and the solutions to Eq. (S.34) are of
the form C±
nlyl(λ±
nlr), where jl(z) and yl(z) denote spherical Bessel functions, and
the coefﬁcients Cnl and Dnl are determined by boundary conditions. The functions jl(z) and yl(z)
behave for large r as jl(z) ∼ z−1 sin(z − lπ/2) and yl(z) ∼ z−1 cos(z − lπ/2). Eq. (S.39) now
has an inﬁnite set of solutions µnl for n > 1, which we order such that µnl > µn+1,l. In an inﬁnite
system, the set µnl approaches a continuous spectrum.

Instability of stationary spherical droplets

The droplet shape is unstable if at least one mode with µ1l > 0 exists. We can obtain a criterion

for this instability by using µnl = 0 in Eq. (S.42). This leads to

deformation characterized by l.

FIG. S2. Eigenvalues µ1l as a function of supersaturation . At the onset of the instability (red dot) the

second mode becomes unstable, leading to droplet division. For larger values of , higher modes become

unstable as well. The same parameters as in Fig. 2A (main text), with ν−/ν0 = 1. Stationary and stable

radii were used (µ10 < 0).

Different modes l can become unstable. The case l = 0 corresponds to changes of the radius. A
droplet with µ10 < 0 has a stable radius ¯R. For l = 1 there always exists one marginal mode with
µ1m = 0, which corresponds to a translation of the steady state and does not lead to an instability.
The ﬁrst mode that becomes unstable and changes the droplet shape is the elongation mode l = 2.
Fig. S2 shows numerically determined values of the largest relaxation rate µ1l for l = 0, 1, 2
and 3 as a function of supersaturation  far from the droplet. The ﬁgure reveals that µ12 changes
sign and becomes positive as  is increased, indicating the shape instability.

Eq. (S.42) can be solved numerically. An approximation of the eigenvalues that is valid in the
