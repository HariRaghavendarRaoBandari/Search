Accumulation layers with very large concentrations of electrons where many subbands are
ﬁlled became recently available due to ionic liquid and other new methods of gating. The low
temperature mobility in such layers is limited by the surface roughness scattering. However theories
of roughness scattering so far dealt only with the small-density single subband two-dimensional
electron gas (2DEG). Here we develop a theory of roughness-scattering limited mobility for the
multisubband large concentration case. We show that with growing 2D electron concentration n
the surface dimensionless conductivity σ/(2e2/h) ﬁrst decreases as ∝ n−6/5 and then saturates as
∼ (daB/∆2) (cid:29) 1, where d and ∆ are the characteristic length and height of the surface roughness,
aB is the eﬀective Bohr radius. This means that in spite of the shrinkage of the 2DEG width and the
related increase of the scattering rate, the 2DEG remains a good metal. Thus, there is no re-entrant
metal-insulator transition at high concentrations conjectured by Das Sarma and Hwang [PRB 89,
121413 (2014)].

I.

INTRODUCTION

The electron mobility is a very important parameter of
electronic devices. In heavily doped bulk semiconductors,
the low temperature mobility is determined by the
electron scattering on ionized donors and is relatively
small.
Larger low temperature mobilities can be
achieved near the surface of a lightly doped say n-type
semiconductor, where the electron accumulation layer
is induced by the applied surface electric ﬁeld.
In
such devices the mobility becomes sensitive to the
semiconductor surface roughness, which can be imagined
as a collection of atomic-size steps of total height ∆
and characteristic size d (cid:29) ∆ along the surface. The
roughness scattering dominates at high electric ﬁelds E
when electrons are squeezed closer to the surface. In this
case1–6 the mobility µ limited by the surface roughness
scattering behaves as µ ∝ 1/E2. For a large enough ﬁeld
E the two-dimensional (2D) concentration of electrons
n ∝ E so that µ ∝ 1/n2 and the surface conductivity
σ = neµ ∝ 1/n. This result holds for an inversion
layer in a lightly doped p-type semiconductor when the
electric ﬁeld E is larger than the electric ﬁeld of the
depletion layer. The low temperature mobility was also
extensively studied in quantum wells, where it is limited
by the surface roughness of both interfaces. This mobility
strongly depends on the width of the quantum well7–9.

Because of the interest in higher mobilities,

the
surface roughness scattering was studied theoretically
only for relatively small concentrations n, when only
the ﬁrst energy quantization subband is ﬁlled at low
temperatures2–9. Also, it was diﬃcult to induce large
electron concentrations n (higher than 1013 cm−2 in
Si). So the the roughness scattering in the case of large
concentrations n when many subbands are ﬁlled at low
temperatures has remained unexplored.

The last decade, however, witnessed growing interest in
accumulation layers with large n which allow to achieve
qualitatively new properties of the electron gas, such as

superconductivity or magnetism. New methods to create
large electron concentrations were developed. One of
them is based on ion gating with help of an electrolyte
or a room temperature ionic liquid, which does not need
an insulator layer and, therefore, makes a double layer
with a very large capacitance.
In Si concentrations
n ∼ 5 · 1013 cm−2 were achieved using gating by an
electrolyte10 and by an ionic liquid11. Even larger
concentrations ∼ 1014 cm−2 were induced in ZnO12,
MoS2

14,15 with this method.

13 and SrTiO3

Another important method is based on heterojunctions
of polar and nonpolar perovskites such as GdTiO3 and
SrTiO3, which accumulate 3 · 1014 cm−2 electrons16.
Concentrations n up to 1015 cm−2 were obtained
combining this eﬀect with the electron spill-out for a
special band alignment17. Similar physics takes place in
GaN-based heterojunctions where concentrations up to
4.4 × 1013 cm−2 were achieved18–20.

At such large concentrations n the dimensionless
parameter na2
B > 1 and many electron subbands are
ﬁlled. Here aB = κ2/m∗e2 is the eﬀective Bohr radius,
κ is the dielectric constant, m∗ is the eﬀective electron
mass. In the cases of ZnO and MoS2 mentioned above
na2
B reaches 5. In semiconductors with relatively large
aB such as GaAs, InAs, InSb, and PbTe, it should be
easy to reach na2

B (cid:29) 1.

As we said above the roughness scattering limited
mobility for
the multisubband case has not been
theoretically studied. In this paper, we ﬁll this gap and
study the low temperature mobility limited by surface
roughness in an accumulation layer with large n. Our
result for the dimensionless conductivity σ(n)/(2e2/h)
1 as a function of
at d < aB is shown on Fig.

model of roughness21 by the thick solid line (black). The

quasi-classical interpretation of our mobility results for
the exponential roughness.
In Sec. V, we introduce
the more formal quantum-mechanical approach starting
from the case of a single subband connecting to previous
studies. In Sec. VI, we discuss the multisubband case,
take into account the scattering of electrons between
diﬀerent subbands, and give the ﬁnal scattering rate and
mobility. We conclude in Sec. VII. In the main text of
the paper we use the scaling approach and drop numerical
coeﬃcients. In Appendix A we estimate the coeﬃcients
of the conductivity for the exponential roughness.

II. ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE OF AN

ACCUMULATION LAYER

The accumulation layer is created near the surface of
an n-type semiconductor when the orthogonal-to-surface
electric ﬁeld E induces a large 2D concentration of
excessive surface electrons n = E/4πe in the layer of
width ∼ L. We assume that n/L is much larger than the
bulk concentration of electrons N in the semiconductor.
This means that the bulk Fermi level at low temperatures
is either below the conduction band bottom or slightly
above it. In Fig. 2 illustrating the accumulation layer
we actually assumed that the bulk Fermi level coincides
with the conduction band bottom, which in this paper
serves as the reference point of the electron energy.
Our description of the electron accumulation layer is
applicable also to an inversion layer in the very lightly
doped p-type semiconductor, where the 2D concentration
ndepl of ionized acceptors forming the depletion layer
is much smaller than the 2D concentration n of the
electrons so that we can still use n = E/4πe.

In this paper we are focused on large E and n cases
when the one-dimensional potential well created by the
electric ﬁeld E along the z-axis (which is deﬁned as
normal to the surface towards the accumulation layer)
is so deep that it has several quantized levels (see
Fig. 2). Each of such levels forms a subband with a
two-dimensional (2D) Fermi gas moving freely parallel to
the surface. At large n all these 2D gases with the same
Fermi level form a three-dimensional (3D) degenerate
gas, which can be described in the Thomas-Fermi
approximation neglecting the discreteness of subbands.
The nonlinear screening of the electric ﬁeld E by such
a gas was studied by solving the Poisson-Thomas-Fermi
equation for the self-consistent potential ϕ(z) and the 3D
electron density N (z) by Frenkel24. The result is24,25

F

We see that with growing n our conductivity at ﬁrst
approximately continues the single subband dependence
1/n, but then saturates. The saturation happens when
the electron wavelength k−1
is equal to the size d of
the roughness. Before this point, the roughness felt
by electrons is averaged over all
irregularities within
the region of size k−1
F . As the concentration increases,
kF increases and fewer irregularities are averaged over
making the surface “rougher” for electrons. When k−1
gets below d, the electron “hits” only a single irregularity
and the level of “roughness” is ﬁxed leading to the
saturation of the conductivity.

F

Our results contradict to the conjecture22 that the
single subband result3 can be extrapolated to the
large-concentration multisubband case (see the thin
dashed line (red) in Fig.
1). This conjecture led
to the dramatic prediction22 that the dimensionless
conductivity could become smaller than unity implying
the re-entrant metal-insulator transition with growing
n. Our results show that at large n the accumulation
layer remains metallic. This agrees with decent mobilities
observed in Refs. 10, 12, 13, and 23.

The organization of our paper is as follows.

Two main models of roughness are used in literature.
One is Gaussian

W (q) =π∆2d2e−q2d2/4,

(6)

where d, ∆ are the characteristic size and height of the
roughness, ∆ (cid:28) d, L. This is the model widely used in
earlier studies such as for the single subband mobility2–8.
However, later experimental observations found that
the spacial correlations are more likely to follow an
exponential behavior21,26

The surface roughness is a random shift of the interface
∆((cid:126)r) from z = 0 so that < ∆((cid:126)r) >= 0, where (cid:126)r = (x, y)
is the coordinate in z = 0 interface plane (see Fig. 3).
The roughness is described by the height correlator and

The important diﬀerence from the Gaussian case is that
here W (q) decays much slower as q−3 at large q. This
leads to a stronger scattering at large n. One way
to envision this kind of roughness is to think about

randomly distributed ﬂat islands of an additional lattice
layer with typical size d on the top of the last complete
layer of the crystal. These islands may, for example
occupy half of the surface area, so that ∆((cid:126)r) = ±∆
appear with equal probability where 2∆ = a is the lattice
constant. Whenever two survey points (cid:126)r and (cid:126)r(cid:48) fall within
the same island, ∆((cid:126)r)∆((cid:126)r(cid:48)) is ∆2. This typically happens
when points are close, i.e., |(cid:126)r − (cid:126)r(cid:48)| (cid:28) d. When one of
the points misses this island ∆((cid:126)r)∆((cid:126)r(cid:48)) is −∆2. The
probability of falling into diﬀerent islands at |(cid:126)r − (cid:126)r(cid:48)| (cid:28) d
is ∝ |(cid:126)r − (cid:126)r(cid:48)|/d. So W ((cid:126)r − (cid:126)r(cid:48)) ∼ ∆2(1 − |(cid:126)r − (cid:126)r(cid:48)|/d).
Such a behavior at small distances determines the large
q asymptote of the Fourier transform W (q) as ∼ 1/q3,
which is the result obtained at large q from Eq.
(7).
Our calculations of the roughness-limited mobility for
accumulation layers are focused on this type of surface
roughness. However, to make a connection with earlier
studies2–8, we will also calculate the mobility for the
Gaussian model and compare the results of these two
models.

Inspired by Ref. 6, in this section we start from an
intuitive quasi-classical picture of the electron scattering
by the surface roughness and get the scaling result shown
in Fig. 1.

Electrons are scattered when they hit the rough
“hard wall” surface. The time between two consecutive
collisions of electrons with the surface is ∼ L/vF ∼
m∗L/kF . For each bounce, the reﬂection is specular
with respect to the tangential plane of the hitting point
and therefore adds a random angle α to the direction of
the reﬂected momentum. Due to this angular diﬀusion,
the total relaxation of the momentum direction requires
α−2 times collisions. Thus the relaxation time is

τ =

m∗L
kF α2 .

(8)

Below we are going to investigate the deviation angle α
at diﬀerent values of kF and thus ﬁnd τ .

For the exponential surface roughness, one can imagine
the irregularities as islands going up or down. Each island
is ﬂat on a scale d and drops or rises abruptly by a
height ∆ on the edges. An electron can be regarded as a
particle only on length scales larger than the wavelength
F . At d (cid:28) k−1
or 1/d (cid:29) kF , electrons can only

Due to the randomness of the distribution of these
islands, the resulting height or depth has a magnitude ∼
F d2 = ∆kF d. Such a height/depth on a length
scale k−1
F eﬀectively results in α = ∆kF d/k−1
F = ∆dk2

when electrons hit the ﬂat middle plane of the island,
there is no momentum relaxation. Only when electrons
happen to hit the sharp edges can they get a “scattering”
reﬂection. Since only on a scale k−1
can electrons be
seen as quasi-classical particles, the scattering edge is
then estimated to be of height ∆ and size k−1

gives rise to α = ∆kF (see Fig. 3b). The probability

One should note that the 2D conductivity saturation

much larger than unity as d, aB (cid:29) ∆ and implies
that the accumulation layer remains metallic at large
concentrations.

V. SINGLE SUBBAND CASE

In previous section, we have employed a quasi-classical
perspective to understand the electron scattering oﬀ the
surface roughness. Now we turn to the more formal
quantum-mechanical approach.

Fermi wavenumber, θ(cid:48) is the angle between initial and
ﬁnal electron momenta and q is the magnitude of the
projection of the transferred momentum (cid:126)q = (cid:126)k − (cid:126)k(cid:48)
in the x − y plane. Due to the electronic screening
inside a single subband, the Fourier transform of the
scattering potential U (q) is reduced by the dielectric
function (q) (cid:39) 1+2/aBq according to the Thomas-Fermi
screening27.

To keep the analysis simple, we start from the single
subband case where the scattering occurs within the
same subband and q = 2kF sin(θ(cid:48)/2).
Let us ﬁrst
check the scattering potential resulting from the surface
roughness. We know that electrons are conﬁned near
the interface and thus have a quantization kinetic energy
z/2m∗ where kz is a multiple of π/L (for
Ez = 2k2
the ﬁrst subband, kz = π/L). Due to the surface
roughness, the conﬁnement width L ﬂuctuates by ∆((cid:126)r)
at position r.
The kinetic energy then varies by
(dEz/dL)∆((cid:126)r) ∼ Ez∆((cid:126)r)/L. These ﬂuctuations of the
quantization kinetic energy act as a ﬂuctuating potential
U ((cid:126)r) for the 2-dimensional motion of conﬁned electrons.
Its scattering matrix element for 2D Bloch states U (q)
within a given subband then satisﬁes

|U (q)|2 =

W (q)δ(kz − π/L),

As a result we get for the scattering rate the following

roughness with d < aB. The case d < aB was studied
for silicon inversion layers in Ref. 3 and discussed in
Introduction above. For the 2D inversion layers, the
width L is determined by the applied electric ﬁeld as
L ∝ E−1/3 and one gets2,3,6 µ ∝ 1/E2. As the electron
concentration increases, the interfacial electric ﬁeld E ∝
n and mobility µ ∝ 1/n2.
Such a dependence was
obtained in Ref. 3 and used in Ref. 22 for extrapolation
to the multisubband case as shown in Fig. 1. Note that
for the 2D quantum wells, the width L of the electron
gas is the same as the well width so that Eq. (17) agrees
with the well known result of Ref. 7.

However, if d > aB, for the single subband case, there
is also a range of concentrations that satisﬁes kF d (cid:29) 1.
The results of two roughness models are diﬀerent. For the
Gaussian case, the typical q is ∼ 1/d and the typical θ(cid:48) is
∼ q/kF ∼ 1/kF d, W (q) ∼ ∆2d2, (q) ∼ 1+d/aB ∼ d/aB.

not only have recovered the results for the Gaussian type
of roughness obtained by previous studies but also have
got the results for the relatively unexplored exponential
roughness. For multisubband accumulation layers, the
situation is diﬀerent from the single subband case. First,
kz is not ∼ 1/L but typically is ∼ kF , where kF =
(n/L)1/3 is the 3D Fermi wavenumber of the electron
gas. Second, in addition to the intrasubband scattering,
there is also intersubband scattering.

Typically, the intersubband scattering rate is of the
same order of the intrasubband scattering. Therefore,
the ﬁnal scattering rate is approximately the product
of the typical intrasubband scattering rate as obtained
in previous section and the total number of subbands
which the initial electron can be scattered into. It is easy
to check that the typical transferred momentum in the
z-direction is of the same order as the typical transferred
momentum q in the x − y plane. At 1/d (cid:29) kF where
q ∼ kF , all subbands “communicate” with each other
and the total number is kF L. Multiplying by kF L the
intrasubband result Eq. (16) with kz ∼ kF , we arrive
at the ﬁnal scattering rate given by Eq.
(9). This
is a universal result for both Gaussian and exponential
models. At 1/d (cid:28) kF , for the exponential roughness,
the typical transferred momentum is q ∼ 1/d for the
small-angle scattering and q ∼ kF for the large-angle
the number of subbands
one.
involved in the scattering process is ∼ L/d, much smaller
than the number kF L for the latter. Therefore, the
large-angle scattering mechanism dominates. Using the
intrasubband scattering rate as given by Eq. (20) and
kz ∼ kF , we arrive at the total scattering rate at
kF d (cid:29) 1 for the exponential roughness given by Eq. (10).
Thereby, we get the same expressions for the mobility
as in Eq. (11). The corresponding 2D conductivity at
large n saturates as σ/(2e2/h) ∼ daB/∆2 (see Fig. 1),
which means that there is no re-entrant metal-insulator
transition. More careful check of this statement requires
accurate evaluations of the numerical coeﬃcients which
are done in Appendix A and conﬁrm our argument that
the saturation value of the conductivity is much larger
than the critical value 2e2/h.

So for the former,

Compared to the simple and neat result in the
exponential case, the mobility for the Gaussian type of
roughness is more complicated. At kF d (cid:29) 1, since for
accumulation layers na2
B > 1, d < aB is possible in this
range. At this value of d, the intrasubband scattering is
unscreened for the Gaussian case and the rate becomes
the same as the unscreened result of the exponential
roughness given by Eq.
(20). The typical momentum
transfer is q ∼ 1/d, so only a few subbands whose
number is ∼ q/L−1 = L/d out of all participate in the
intersubband scattering. The total scattering rate is then
the scattering rate in Eq. (20) times L/d. At even larger
d (cid:29) L (cid:29) k−1
F , the typical momentum transferred 1/d
is smaller than the z-direction momentum quantization
1/L. No intersubband scattering is possible and the total
scattering rate is given by Eq.
(20). This situation

resembles the single subband case and is natural since
when L (cid:28) d we actually are dealing with a 2D system.
When d exceeds the 2D screening radius aB (cid:29) L, not
only the scattering is restricted within the same subband
but also the potential is screened. One should then use
Eq.
(18) for the total (intrasubband) scattering. The

the obtained µ(n) dependence is

corresponding scaling behavior of the 2D conductivity σ

(aB/d)5 is much smaller than 1. Throughout the 3D
metallic range where na2
B > 1, there is only one result
for the Gaussian and exponential models respectively
as given by the last column in Table.
I. The smallest
conductivity for the exponential case is larger than 2e2/h
as mentioned above. For the Gaussian model, at d (cid:28) aB,
the smallest σ/(2e2/h) is also ∼ daB/∆2. Since in reality,
d > ∆, we get σ/(2e2/h) (cid:29) 1. At d (cid:29) aB, σ/(2e2/h) ≥
d3/aB∆2 (cid:29) 1. So, the smallest conductivity for the
Gaussian roughness is also always above the critical value
and no re-entrant metal-insulator transition will happen
in realistic situations.

In Sec. IV, we gave a quasi-classical explanation of the
mobility limited by the exponential surface roughness.
Inspired by Ref.

roughness results quasi-classically as well. Below we
again start from Eq.

In this paper, we have studied the surface-roughness
limited mobility
and multisubband
accumulation layers as a function of the 2D electron
concentration n for two models of the surface roughness
both quantum-mechanically and quasi-classically. For
the more realistic exponential roughness, the mobility
decreases as ∝ 1/n at large n and results in a 2D
conductivity saturation as σ/(2e2/h) (cid:39) 1.2daB/∆2 (cid:29) 1
since the characteristic roughness size d and the eﬀective
Bohr
than the characteristic
roughness height ∆ (cid:39) a/2 where a is the lattice constant.
For the Gaussian roughness which was widely used in
earlier studies, the minimum conductivity is found to be
larger than the critical value as well. So there is no reason
to expect the re-entrant metal-insulator transition22
at large concentrations.
Indeed, decent conductivities
were observed in large concentration accumulation
layers in Refs. 10, 12, 13, and 23. By measuring the
conductivity saturation value σ/(2e2/h) (cid:39) 1.2daB/∆2 of
the exponential roughness, one can probe the geometry
of the roughness obtaining values of d, similarly to
what was done for the Gaussian roughness in previous
works3,7.

In Eq. (3), it shows that about 90% of electrons are
located within a distance L/2 from the interface. So it is
a good approximation to assume that electrons inside the
accumulation layer are more accurately conﬁned within
a width of D = L/2. Then, the wave function of each
subband can be approximated as

roughness in diﬀerent situations. At kF d (cid:28) 1, the
roughness relief is averaged over the electron wavelength
and the resulting relaxation time is the same as in the
F (cid:28) d (cid:28) L, the
exponential case given by Eq. (9). At k−1
wavelength k−1
F is smaller than the size of the roughness
hill. The electron then collides with a single hill (valley)
each time it hits the surface and the deviation angle α
is the slope of each single hill (valley) ∼ ∆/d (see Fig.
(22a). At
3a). The relaxation time is given by Eq.
L (cid:28) d (cid:28) aB, the size of each single hill is so large
that the electron can hit the same hill consecutively
for several times during which it has traveled back and
forth for ∼ d/L times within the accumulation layer.
Since these consecutive hits are on the same slope, the
scattered angle is the same and α accumulates, diﬀerent
from uncorrelated random collisions on diﬀerent hills
(valleys). After the electron ﬁnishes colliding with the
same slope, the accumulated angle is (∆/d)(d/L) =
(∆/L) (cid:28) 1 and the time of such a series of collisions is
∼ (L/kF )(d/L) = d/kF . One then gets the relaxation
(22b). At d (cid:29) aB, the electronic
time as in Eq.
screening changes the scattering potential by a factor
aB/d, which can eﬀectively be regarded as reducing
the roughness height from ∆ to ∆aB/d. The resulting
relaxation time grows and is given by Eq. (22c). Thus
we obtained quasi-classically the same scaling behavior
of the mobility limited by the Gaussian roughness as by
the quantum-mechanical approach.
