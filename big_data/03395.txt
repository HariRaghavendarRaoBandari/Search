Summary

The paper deals with the generic problem of two
waveguides coupled by perforations, which can be per-
forated tube muﬄers without or with partitions, pos-
sibly with absorbing materials. Other examples are
ducts with branched resonators of honeycomb cav-
ities, which can be coupled or not, and splitter si-
lencers. Assuming low frequencies, only one mode is
considered in each guide. The propagation in the two
waveguides can be very diﬀerent, thanks e.g. to the
presence of constrictions. The model is a discrete,
periodic one, based upon 4th-order impedance ma-
trices and their diagonalization. All the calculation
is analytical, thanks to the partition of the matrices
in 2nd-order matrices, and allows the treatment of
a very wide types of problems. Several aspects are
investigated: the local or non-local character of the
reaction of one guide to the other; the deﬁnition of
a coupling coeﬃcient; the eﬀect of ﬁnite size when a
lattice with n cells in inserted into an inﬁnite guide;
the relationship between the Insertion Loss and the
dispersion. The assumptions are as follows:
linear
acoustics, no mean ﬂow, rigid wall. However the ef-
fect of the series impedance of the perforations, which
is generally ignored, is taken into account, and is dis-
cussed. When there are no losses, it is shown that,
for symmetry reasons, the cutoﬀ frequencies depend
on either the series impedance or the shunt admit-
tance, and are the eigenfrequencies of the cells of the
lattice, with zero-pressure or zero-velocity at the ends
of the cells.

Introduction

The present paper describes an attempt of a generic
study of several problems that are now classical: per-
forated tube muﬄers without [1–5] or with parti-
tions [6]. They can be with absorbing materials
[7–9]. Related problems are tubes with branched
resonators, which can be uncoupled [10, 11] or cou-
pled [12], or with honeycomb cavities [13, 14]. Other
kind of systems are splitter silencers with perforated
facing [15–20]. This generic problem is that of a peri-
odic lattice of two waveguides coupled by perforations.

Figure 1: Sectional view of the type of lattice under
study :
lateral perforations (dark grey) couple two
waveguides periodically along the direction of propa-
gation. Each waveguide have its own acoustic proper-
ties. In Guide 2, diaphragms are periodically spaced
along the direction of propagation

Assuming low frequencies, only one mode is consid-
ered in each guide, therefore the system in study is a
system with two coupled modes. The propagation in
the two waveguides can be very diﬀerent, thanks to
the presence of constrictions, diaphragms, porous ma-
terial, partitions or other type of obstacles (see Figure
1). Following Sullivan [2], we use a discrete, periodic
model based on 4th-order transfer matrices. However
the product of these transfer matrices can lead to di-
verging products when evanescent modes are present,
and this can be avoided by combining a decoupling ap-
proach, i.e., a diagonalization, and then the transfor-
mation of a transfer matrix into an impedance matrix
for the ﬁnite-length lattice. The decoupling approach
was used also in a continuous modeling ( [4, 21], see
also [22] p 356).

The papers aims at showing that it is possible to
use an analytical formulation for a very wide class of
problems, with the illustration of basic examples of
coupled waveguides. Thanks to a discrete model, the
diagonalization of 4th-order transfer matrices can be
found analytically, by using the partition of these ma-
trices into 2nd-order matrices. The study of the cou-
pling between two guides especially involves an analy-
sis of the local or non-local character of the coupling.
Generally speaking, coupling is obviously strong when
the perforations are wide, but also when propagation
in the two guides is rather similar (i.e., the two prop-

1

agation constants are close). This analysis is done for
lattices of ﬁnite length, focusing on the behaviour re-
lationships between the Insertion Loss coeﬃcient and
the dispersion curves and frequency bands.

A major diﬃculty is the modeling of the perfo-
rations. Semi-empirical formulas are generally used
[2, 23–27], especially when there is a mean ﬂow. One
focus of the present paper is on the role of the series
impedance of the perforation [28], which can be ig-
nored in a continuous model, but not in a discrete
model. A priori this impedance, due to the anti-
symmetric ﬁeld in the perforation, must be accounted
for the case of wide and well spaced perforations. To
our knowledge, no paper used the complete model
found in the paper published in 1994 [28]. However
for a similar problem in musical acoustics, the eﬀect
of the series impedance of tone-holes of woodwind in-
struments, can be signiﬁcant [29–31].

The values of the perforation shunt admittance and
series impedance are not discussed in detail in this
paper, but the values given in [28] are suﬃcient for a
discussion (exact values were given for the 2D, rect-
angular case at low frequencies, but for the cylindrical
case, only approximate formulas were proposed).

Several papers are concerned with more general
systems with more than two guides, or with 2D si-
lencers, in particular for applications to metamateri-
als [10,32–38]. They are not discussed here. Concern-
ing a general view on 1D periodic structures, we refer
to classical references [39, 40].

The assumptions are as follows: linear acoustics, no
mean ﬂow, rigid walls. However the diagonalization
is done in a very wide, linear framework. The basic
geometry and the model used are described in Sec-
tion 2, with the deﬁnition of the transfer matrix of
a lattice cell. Section 3 derives the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of a cell, using the more general result
given in Appendix 7. For the case of lossless guides,
the cut-oﬀ frequencies are determined.

For a ﬁnite lattice of n cells, the impedance ma-
trix is derived by using the calculation of the transfer
matrix calculated given in Appendix A3. Finally the
insertion loss of the lattice into an inﬁnite waveguide
is derived. Section 5 proposes a theoretical analysis
of the coupling between the two guides, focusing on
the eﬀect of the series impedance; on a deﬁnition of a
coupling coeﬃcient; and on a derivation of a condition
for a local reaction. Finally numerical simulations of
application examples are presented in Section 6, with
an analysis of the insertion loss with respect to the
nature of the two modes.

2 Generic geometry; model and

notations

2.1 Geometry

The two guides are coupled by perforation, as shown
in Fig.
2. When their cross section is uniform,
the waves are planar at an axial distance from per-
forations larger that the transverse dimensions, so
that the evanescent modes due to perforations vanish.
When the cross section is not uniform, the change in
cross-section area needs to be suﬃciently far from the
perforation, i.e., at an axial distance larger than the
transverse dimension. The propagation in the guides
is characterized by the eﬀective density ρi and the
speed of sound ci (the subscript i = 1, 2). The change
in cross section allows various situations to be created,
as shown in Figure 3. When the propagation is identi-
cal is the two guides, the lattice is homogeneous, while
when diaphragms are present in one guide only, the
lattice is non-homogeneous. The case of branched res-
onators without longitudinal coupling between them
is a limit case, with a local reaction of Guide 2 on
Guide 1.

2.2 Model for a perforation

The general model, valid in harmonic regime, is devel-
oped in [28]. It is summarized hereafter, with similar
notations. Four basic quantities are chosen to be the
coeﬃcients p and v of the planar mode for the acoustic
pressure and velocity, respectively, in the two guides.

They build a 4th-order vector, V, as follows:

V =(cid:18) V1

vi(cid:19) ,
V2(cid:19) where Vi =(cid:18) pi

i = 1, 2. The following notations are chosen: calli-
graphic characters correspond to 4th-order matrices
and vectors, while bold characters correspond to 2nd-
order matrices and vectors (e.g. I and I are the iden-
tity matrices of order 4 and 2, respectively); other
quantities are scalar. For a periodic medium made
of asymmetric lattice cells, one perforation at xn is
followed by a portion of length 2ℓ of separated waveg-
uides (see Fig. 2). The vectors V are related by 4th-
order matrices.
For a perforation the following relationship is de-
rived in [28] (the subscripts L and R correspond to
the left side and right side of a perforation, respec-
tively):

VL = PF VR

S1,2 are the cross-section areas of the guides. This
model considers the eﬀect of a perforation as local-
ized at the abscissa of the perforation center, as ex-
plained in [41]. Za and Ys are the series impedance
and shunt admittance of the perforation, respectively
(these quantities are speciﬁc impedance and speciﬁc
admittance, i.e., ratios pressure/velocity and veloc-
ity/pressure, respectively). Both are acoustic masses
and correspond to the anti-symmetric and symmetric
pressure ﬁeld in the perforation, respectively. When
Za = 0, Ys produces a jump in velocity inside each
guide, from the left to the right of the perforation,
along the guide axis. In a dual way, when Ys = 0, Za
produces a jump in pressure inside each guide, from
the left to the right of the perforation. Reciprocity is
assumed, therefore the determinant of PF is unity.

2.3 Model for the propagation in the

For a non-perforated portion of the waveguides, be-
tween abscissas xn and xn+1, the following 4th-order

nuities and/or dissipation.

2.4 Model for the propagation with
and

asymmetric

perforations:
symmetric cells

For a periodic medium, two types of cells can be con-
sidered (see Fig. 2): i) an asymmetric cell, involving
a perforation followed by a portion of tubes of length
2ℓ; ii) a symmetric cell involving a portion of tubes of
length ℓ, then perforation, then a portion of tube of
length ℓ. The complete transfer matrix of an asym-
metric cell (see Fig.2) can be characterized by the
equation:

VL,n = PFT V L,n+1 .

(8)

The case of a symmetric cell is more particular, but
remains very general. It will be used for the diago-
nalization (see next section). For such a cell, between
abscissas xn + ℓ and xn+1 + ℓ, the transfer matrix

relationship is given by:

Vn−1 = (TLPFTR)Vn ,

(9)

where Vn =t (p1n, v1n, p2n, v2n), deﬁned in Equation
(1), is considered at mid-distance (abscissa xn + ℓ)
between two perforations. The transfer matrix T
(Equation (6)) describing the uncoupled propagation
over distance 2ℓ between two neighboring perforations
is therefore the product of the two transfer matrices:

T = TRTL,

(10)

where TL (resp.TR) describes the uncoupled propa-
gation over the distance ℓ situated on the left (resp.
right) of one perforation. Since T is block-diagonal
(Equation (6)), we can adopt the same decomposi-
tion for 2nd-order blocks, namely T1 = TR1TL1, and
T2 = TR2TL2. Moreover, in order for the cell to be
symmetric, we generalize the concept of reversed four-
terminal explained in [39]. The matrices TL (i = 1, 2)
need to be proportional to the invert of the matrices
TR, with a change in sign for the x-axis, and with the
same determinant δ. This means:

CL AL(cid:19) ,
CR DR(cid:19) =(cid:18) DL BL
(cid:18) AR BR

(11)

With this condition the matrix T is symmetric:

A = D = ALDL + BLCL; B = 2BLDL C = 2CLAL.
(12)
Moreover reciprocity is assumed (in particular no
ﬂow is present), i.e., the determinant is unity, as well
as the determinant of the 4th-order matrix T . More
general cases are investigated in Appendix 7.

3.1 Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

In this section, we are searching for the diagonal form
of the transfer matrix TLPFTR (Equation (9)) for an
elementary, symmetric cell (with reciprocity) of the
periodic lattice shown on Fig.(2):

Pachebat and Kergomard, p. 4

Appendix 7 for the most general case (no reciprocity
is required). Since for the perforation matrix (Equa-
tion (2)), det PF = 1, the eigenvalues of the diagonal
matrix D (Equation (14)) can be grouped by inverse
pairs when reciprocity holds for the elementary cell

(cid:0)λ(1), λ(2)(cid:1) = (λ, 1/λ) and (cid:0)λ(3), λ(4)(cid:1) = (λ′, 1/λ′)

(see [28]). Each pair corresponds to opposite prop-
agation directions of an eigenmode along the lattice
axis. They are denoted λ = exp(Γ) and λ′ = exp(Γ′).
This leads to te following dispersion equation for the
unknowns Γ and Γ ′:

det T0 = A0D0 − B0C0 = 0,

(16)

where

A0 = D0 = − sinh Γ [γ2/Q1 + γ1/Q2]

Similar expressions can be found for h2 and z2. For h′

and z ′
0, and similarly

1, Γ is changed in Γ′ and w0 in w′

for the quantities with subscript 2. The matrix eD−1/2

corresponds to a shift of an eigenvector by one half-
cell. v0 is an arbitrary constant with the dimension of
a velocity. Notice that because the eigenvectors are
deﬁned apart from a multiplicative constant, three
quantities deﬁne an eigenvector. Coming back to the
deﬁnition of the physical-quantity vectors (see Equa-
tion (1)), we deduce the following interpretations:

• The ratio z1/h1 is the (speciﬁc) characteristic
impedance in Guide 1 for the ﬁrst propagation
constant Γ;

• Because the second eigenvalue corresponds to
a change in sign of the propagation constant
Γ, the corresponding characteristic impedance is
−z1/h1, as expected;

• Similar remarks hold for subscript 2 and super-

script ’;

λ(i) are the eigenvalues and W (i) (i = 1..4) are the
eigenvectors. The detailed calculation is derived in

• With the two characteristic impedances, the last
quantity deﬁning an eigenvector is the velocity
ratio −h1/h2; this ratio is identical for the two
waves with opposite propagation constants.

In order to calculate the constant Γ, Equation (16)
can be re-written as a 2nd-order equation for the un-
known cosh(Γ). For this purpose the terms propor-
tional to γ2
2 can be rearranged by using the re-
lations γ1 + γ2 = 1 and sinh2 Γ− BiCi = cosh2 Γ− A2
i .
The following equation is obtained:

+A1A2 (1 + YsZa) + γ2A2E1 + γ1A1E2 = 0, (22)

where d12 = (A1 − A2)(γ2 − γ1)YsZa and Ei =
YsBi + ZaCi. Thanks to Equation (22), general solu-
tions cosh Γ and cosh Γ′, for the two modes Γ and Γ′
of the lattice can be written explicitly.

3.2 Reciprocity relationships

Reciprocity is related to the choice of matrices T1, T2
and M, with a determinant equal to unity. In order
to ﬁnd the consequences on the eigenvectors of a cell,
we start from the classical reciprocity equation valid
for guides without ﬂow. We write it on the surface Σ
of a cell (e.g., a symmetric cell):

ˆ ˆΣ(cid:18)p(i)−−→v(j) − p(j)−→v(i)(cid:19) d−→Σ = 0.

(23)

The superscripts i and j correspond to two diﬀerent
situations. For instance two situations where only
one eigenmode exists can be chosen. The integral
vanishes on all rigid walls, therefore it is limited to
the input and output of a cell. The term in paren-
thesis in Equation (23) is the same for the output
surface and the input surface, apart from the fac-
tor − exp(Γ(i)) exp(Γ(j)). Therefore it is possible to
factorize the term (cid:2)1 − exp(Γ(i)) exp(Γ(j))(cid:3), and for
the eigenmodes corresponding to Γ and −Γ, Equation
(23) is trivial because this term vanishes. It remains
to solve the following equation:

ˆ ˆS1+S2(cid:16)p−→v′ − p′−→v(cid:17) d−→Σ = 0

(24)

for the modes corresponding to Γ and Γ′, and to Γ and
−Γ′. Using the expressions (18) of the eigenvectors,
the following equations are obtained:

γ1z1h′

1 = −γ2z2h′

2 ; γ1z ′

1h1 = −γ2z ′

2h2.

(25)

A direct checking of these equations is heavy. Reci-
procity implies also the symmetry of the impedance
matrix, as shown in Section 4.1.

Pachebat and Kergomard, p. 5

3.3 Lossless lattices; cut-oﬀ frequen-

cies

Up to now the considered lattice is can be lossy, when
one of the coeﬃcients deﬁning a cell is complex. For
lossless waveguides, several types of waves can ex-
ist [28]. When reciprocity holds, each of the two
modes with propagation constant Γ and Γ′ can be
either propagating or evanescent. In the case of two
evanescent waves the possibility for the propagation
constant to be complex was found: the energy ﬂux
in each guide decreases exponentially, but is not zero
(its sign is opposite in the two guides, ensuring the
energy conservation).

Ref. [28] studied the particular case of an homoge-
nous lattice, i.e., a lattice with identical transfer ma-
trices T in the two guides. This happens for example
when the guides are straight guides with the same
sound speed and density.
In this case, there is at
least one propagating wave, and the decomposition of
the propagation into two modes (one is planar, the
other one is called the “ﬂute” mode) is valid even for
a lattice with irregular perforations.

The cut-oﬀ frequencies are given by coshΓ = ±1,
i.e., Γ = 0 or Γ = jπ. Therefore, according to Equa-
tions (17), A0 = D0 = 0, and the dispersion equa-
tion (16) implies either B0 = 0 or C0 = 0. Writing
cosh Γ = ±1 in Equation (17), and using Equations
(11,12) with the property det(TL) = 1, the cut-oﬀ fre-
quencies are given by one of the four following equa-
tions:

Γ = 0; B0 = 0; ⇒

Γ = 0; C0 = 0; ⇒

Γ = jπ; B0 = 0; ⇒

Γ=jπ; C0=0;⇒

The characteristic impedances of the two guides, zi/hi
(see Equations.(19,20), are found to be either inﬁ-
nite ou zero.
It is interesting to interpret these re-
sults. Consider the example of Equation (26). Be-
cause Γ = 0, for an inﬁnite lattice, pn = pn+1 in each
guide, and because the characteristic impedance is in-
ﬁnite, the velocity vanishes at the extremities of the
cell. Consequently, if there is a opening at the ex-
tremity of the cell, this cut-oﬀ does not depend on
the opening.
It can be checked that this equation
gives the eigenfrequency of the cell when it is closed
at their extremities (inﬁnite impedance). The second
and the third terms of Equation (26) correspond to
the impedance in Guide 1 and 2, respectively, at the
abscissa of the perforation, calculated by projecting
the inﬁnite impedance at the end of the cell to the
perforation abscissa. Moreover the pressure ﬁeld in
the cell being symmetrical, the series impedance Za

does not intervene.

Similar interpretation can be done for the three
other equations, using the duality pressure/velocity.

In order to derive the (acoustic) impedance matrix
of a lattice of n cells, the vector V (Equation (1)) is

if gi = Sihi. This acoustic impedance matrix is di-
rectly derived from this transfer matrix.
It is cho-
sen for two reasons: i) the impedance matrix avoids
numerical diﬃculties that appear using transfer ma-
trix products, for strongly evanescent eigenmodes and
a large number of cells;
ii) the impedance matrix
makes easy the boundary conditions to be introduced
at each end of the lattice. Consider two 4th-order

vectors t(cid:0) P0 U0(cid:1) and t(cid:0) Pn Un(cid:1) related by a (gen-

eral) matrix as follows:

where A, B, C and D are 2nd order-matrices. This

Actually, because of the diﬀerent sign before S−1

the second diagonal, this impedance matrix is anti-
symmetric (with a change in the orientation of the
velocities at the extremity n, the impedance matrix
would become symmetric). Notice that the matrix
Z has the dimension of a speciﬁc impedance, while
the matrix G has the dimension of the inverse of an
area. Furthermore, for evanescent modes (real Γ) the
ratios coshΓ/sinhΓ and 1/sinhΓ do no diverge when n
tends to inﬁnity, unlike the coeﬃcients of the transfer
matrix.

4.2 Lattice of ﬁnite length inserted

into an inﬁnite waveguide

We consider the geometry shown in Figure 4. A lattice
of ﬁnite length, with n cells, is inserted into an inﬁnite
waveguide so as to act as an acoustic wall treatment.
By closing Guide 2 at each end of the lattice (Equation
(38)) by an impedance condition (Figure 4), the 4th-
order impedance matrix (Equation (37)) is reduced
to a 2nd-order one, and the Insertion Loss [22] of the
ﬁnite lattice can be obtained.

Simple boundary conditions are chosen. Guide 2
is closed at each end by setting u2,0 = u2,n = 0 into
Equation (37). The 2nd-order impedance matrix of
the ﬁnite lattice can be derived:

(cid:18) p1,0

= h ˆZ/ sinh nΓ + ˆZ ′/ sinh nΓ′i ,

(39)

(40)

where the impedances ˆZ and ˆZ ′ associated to each
mode result from Equation (34) as follows:

ˆZ = z1g′

2/(det G) and

ˆZ ′ = z ′

1g2/(det G).

(41)

Recall that these impedances are acoustic impedances
(ratio pressure/ﬂow rate). This particular case of lat-
tice is built as the combination of two four-terminals
with their extremities in series, each four-terminal
corresponding to a propagation mode with constant
Γ and Γ′. Expression (38) is then written in form of
a transfer matrix:

Let us consider an inﬁnite waveguide with charac-

and incoming plane wave have the amplitudes p+
1 =
(p1 + ¯zc1u1)/2 and p−
1 = (p1 − ¯zc1u1)/2, respectively.
Once the ﬁnite lattice of Fig.(4) is inserted, the trans-

(44)

The insertion loss is deﬁned as the ratio of the sound
power of the incident plane wave to that of the trans-
mitted one across the ﬁnite lattice with characteristic
impedance ¯zc1 at its both ends. It is equal to:

We notice from Expressions (44,45) that when ZB = 0
(Equation (40)), i.e., when:

ˆZ/ sinh nΓ + ˆZ ′/ sinh nΓ′ = 0 ,

(46)

the transmission coeﬃcient is zero, and the associated
insertion loss is inﬁnite (in practice it is limited by
losses).

5 Analysis of the coupling ef-
fect; local vs non-local reac-
tion

5.1 Eﬀect of the series impedance on

the coupling

The respective roles of the series impedance Za and
the shunt admittance Ys can be discussed qualita-
tively at the zero-frequency limit. Exact values are
known for the 2D, rectangular case. For the cylindri-
cal case, we use approximate values for two guides
with radii a1and a2 and the same ﬂuid density ρ,
which exhibit the dependence on the parameters [28]:

Y −1
s ≃ jω

ρ
rp

S1; Za ≃ −jω0.57ρr2

pa1/S1,

(47)

where j = (−1)2, ω is the angular frequency. rp is
the radius of the perforation, and a2 is assumed to be
larger than a1. A ﬁrst observation is that the prod-
uct YsZa is independent of the frequency and is very
small, because it is proportional to (rp/a1)3. As a con-
sequence, at a ﬁrst approximation, Equation (22) can
be simpliﬁed in:

(cosh Γ − A1 − γ2E1)(cosh Γ − A2 − γ1E2)

= γ1γ2E1E2.

(48)

The inﬂuence of the series impedance can be esti-
mated by considering the expression of the quantities
Ei. Considering the low frequency case, the guides
are reduced to lumped elements, Bi = 2jωρℓ is a
mass and Ci = 2jωℓ/ρc2 is a compliance (c is the
sound speed). It turns out that YsBi is a ratio of two
masses, while ZaCi is proportional to ω2: therefore
the eﬀect of the series impedance Za can be neglected
at low frequency. This justiﬁes the following analysis
of the coupling of the two guides with Za = 0. This
approximation will be done from here until to the end
of the paper.

5.2 Eigenvalues and eigenvectors for

the simpliﬁed model

What are the conditions for reducing the number of
guided modes form 2 to 1?

If Za = 0, the perforation matrix (Equation (4))
connects the two guides through one coupling quan-
tity only, the shunt admittance Ys. The dispersion
Equation (16 or 22) reduces to Equation (48), with
Ei = YsBi. This equation is obtained for the choice of
speciﬁc admittances and impedances, corresponding
to the choice of acoustic pressure and velocity (of the
planar mode) as basic quantities for the considered 4-
ports. This choice is convenient for the description of
the perforation eﬀects, but when the series impedance
Za is ignored, it is easier to use ﬂow rates instead of

where B1 = B1/S1 B2 = B2/S2 and the acoustic
admittance ¯Yp is given by:

Ys =

For the calculation of the eigenvectors, we make the

The mode Γ′ is obtained by exchanging the subscripts
1 and 2. For a very weak coupling, the solution (57)
can be interpreted, at the ﬁrst order of C, as follows:
the medium 2 acts as an equivalent impedance Zeq =
¯Y −1
on the medium 1. The pressure becomes very
p
small in the medium 2.

5.3.2 The strong coupling limit; locally react-

ing impedance

Strong coupling occurs when the media are not very
diﬀerent or when the perforation eﬀect is strong (large
opening of the perforation and/or low frequencies).
The solutions cosh Γ and cosh Γ′ of Equation (49) can
be written as a series expansion with respect to C −1:

admittances need to be modiﬁed, and Equation (48)
becomes:

5.3 Deﬁnition of the coupling coeﬃ-

+

cient

The discriminant ∆ of the quadratic equation in
cosh Γ (Equation (49)) can be written by exhibiting a
coupling coeﬃcient C, as follows:

∆ = (A1 − A2)2(cid:20)1 + 2

B1 − B2

B1 + B2 C + C2 ,(cid:21)(55)

where

C =

1
2

¯Yp

B1 + B2
A1 − A2

.

(56)

The coupling coeﬃcient C is proportional to the per-
foration admittance ¯Yp, and inversely proportional to
the diﬀerence between the coeﬃcients A1 and A2 of
the two guides, which are characteristic of the propa-
gation into each guide separately. For identical guides,
C is inﬁnite; at low frequencies, the admittance is
large, so is C. Two extreme cases can therefore be
distinguished.

The mode Γ is an average value of the two propaga-
tion constants given by cosh Γ = A1 and cosh Γ = A2.
The mode Γ′ is a generalization of the ﬂute mode
(see [28]): it is strongly evanescent at low frequencies
and for large perforations (large ¯Yp ). This mode was
also given by Pierce [22] for the continuous case of
a perforated tube muﬄer. The pressure ratios corre-
sponding to the two modes Γ and Γ′ are:

p2(cid:21) = 1 +

The ﬁrst solution corresponds to a modiﬁed planar

case where the mode Γ′ is strongly evanescent, only
the ﬁrst mode can be taken into account, and the
eﬀect of the second medium on the ﬁrst one (or vice-
versa) can be represented by an equivalent impedance
Zeq, the second one being equivalent to a locally re-
acting medium. This impedance can be found from
the following dispersion equation:

cosh Γ = A1 +

(62)

odic medium built with a cell described by the follow-
ing transfer matrix:

From Equations (59,62), the following equivalent
impedance Zeq is found to be:

. (63)

Obviously this concept of equivalent impedance is es-
pecially interesting if it does not depend on the ﬁrst
medium: this situation occurs if B1 << B2, and
A1 << A2. As expected, it can be checked that these
conditions of local reaction are fulﬁlled in particular
when the cells of the second medium are uncoupled,
e.g. thanks to closed walls between them.
If these
conditions are satisﬁed the equivalent impedance is
the sum of the perforation impedance and the half of
the input impedance of a cell of the second medium,
closed by a rigid wall:

and corresponds to Helmholtz resonators branched

on Guide 1.

6 Application examples of lat-

tices with ﬁnite length

6.1 Deﬁnition of the geometries con-

sidered

We consider the geometries of ﬁnite length lattices
shown in Figure 3. In particular we focus on parame-
ters (see Table 1) that correspond to the strong cou-
pling case (see Section 5.3.2). Therefore Guide 2 is
strongly coupled to Guide 1 and acts as an acoustic
wall treatment on Guide 1.

If the series impedance of the perforation is ignored,
the perforation matrix (Equation (4)) is completely
deﬁned by choosing the speciﬁc shunt admittance Ys.
A simple formula, suﬃcient for our purpose is chosen

(65)

where R = 2√2ηρω is a small resistive term [42]
describing viscous losses near the perforation and η
is the shear viscosity of the ﬂuid. This allows lim-
iting the resonance heights. Equation (65) is valid
for small perforations, and also for a length between
perforations suﬃciently large in comparison with the
transverse dimensions of the guide. This issue, which
is important for the understanding of the transition
between discrete and continuous descriptions, is dis-
cussed in [28]. For the sake of simplicity we consider
here that an equivalent radius exists (see e.g. [43]).
We deﬁne the radius rp of the perforation thanks to its
open area ratio in one cell of Guide 1 σp = πr2
p/(2ℓa1).
The shunt admittance ¯Yp vanishes when the perfora-
tion is closed.

If propagation losses are ignored, Zc = ρc and k = ω/c
are the characteristic impedance and wavenumber of
the medium (air) ﬁlling the guides 1 and 2. For Guide
1, the transfer matrix along length ℓ is: T1R = T1L =
T, and T1 = T2 for the length 2ℓ (Equation (7)).
Inside Guide 2, we write for the length ℓ on the left of
a perforation T2L = Dd T, and T2R = T Dd on the
right. Therefore T2= TD2
d T for the length 2ℓ . The
matrix

corresponds to the presence of a diaphragm within
Guide 2, and introduces the non-homogeneity be-
tween the two guides. For the sake of simplicity, the

(acoustic) impedance is ¯Zd = jωρS2/2rd (cid:0)1 − √σd(cid:1),

where rd is the opening radius of a diaphragm with-
out thickness, and σd = (rd/a2)2 is its open area ratio.
This is a crude simpliﬁcation of Fock’s formula [44].

6.2 From homogeneous

to slightly

non-homogeneous lattices

Consider the homogeneous lattice shown in Figure 3c,
where the same medium ﬁlls the waveguides 1 and 2.
No diaphragm is placed in Waveguide 2. The lattice is
said to be homogeneous. The wavenumber and char-
acteristic impedance are identical for the two waveg-
uides, and A1 = A2 = A = cos(2kℓ). Equation (52)
gives the planar mode with constant Γ and the ﬂute
mode with constant Γ′:

They correspond to the ﬁrst term of Equations (59)
and (60), respectively (the coupling coeﬃcient C is
inﬁnite). Their variation with frequency is shown in
Figure 5 (top and center). The planar mode, with

Γ = 2jkℓ, is not dispersive and is unaﬀected by the
perforation admittance ¯Yp. The ﬂute mode, with con-
stant Γ′,
is evanescent at low frequencies, because
¯Yp is high, yielding cosh Γ′ > 1 (or Re(Γ) > 0 and
Im(Γ) = 0). The mode Γ′ is cut on at f = 247 Hz.
Above this frequency the two modes propagate within
the lattice.

Looking at frequencies below 797 Hz (this limit is
explained later on), the Insertion Loss obtained for
the homogeneous lattice (Figure 5 (bottom) is similar
to the results presented in [1] (Figure 12). The In-
sertion Loss curve exhibits a low frequency behaviour
similar to that of an expansion chamber (driven by the
expansion ratio S1/S2). At higher frequencies, high
Insertion Loss peaks, limited by losses, are observed.
As a ﬁrst result of the present analysis, this be-
haviour change in Insertion Loss can be associated to
the number of propagating modes (here 1 or 2) within
the lattice. A second result is that the frequencies at
which the Insertion Loss is maximum are given by
Equation (46). It can be shown that the maximum
for Insertion Loss is resonant (limited by losses) only
if the two terms of Equation (46) have the same order
of magnitude and if the lattice length is ﬁnite.

Above 797 Hz, a stop band of Bragg type appears
for the ﬂute mode Γ′, with a high Insertion Loss (Fig-
ure 5, bottom).
In a Bragg stop band (or Bragg
resonance due to spatial periodicity) we have Im(Γ)
is a constant nπ, where n is an integer and Re(Γ)
is positive but remains ﬁnite [40]. Unlike Figure 5,
this behaviour is not reported in [1], presumably be-
cause the spatial periodicity of the lattice that [1] used
makes the Bragg stop band out of the frequency band
presented (unfortunately this periodicity is not men-
tioned in [1]).

Let us now consider a slightly non-homogeneous lat-
tice. The diaphragms are now slightly closed (σd =
(rd/a2)2 ≃ 0.98). The solution of the dispersion
Equation (52) for the mode Γ of the non-homogenous
lattice is:

cosh Γ =

1

2(cid:18)A1 + A2 +

1
2

¯Yp(cid:2)B1 + B2(cid:3) −

√∆(cid:19) ,

(69)
where ∆ is given by Equation (55). The second so-
lution for the mode Γ′ is given by the same result,

changing the sign before ∆. The mode Γ′ is not re-
ally aﬀected by the added mass. In particular, its ﬁrst
cut-oﬀ frequency remains unchanged at 247 Hz, like
for the homogeneous lattice (the cut-oﬀ frequencies
for the slightly non-homogeneous lattice are given in
Table 2). This is explained by symmetry properties
discussed in Section 3.3, which imply that the veloc-
ity within the diaphragms vanishes at that particular
frequency.
However

the mass added by the diaphragms
strongly modiﬁes the mode Γ: the mode is now disper-
sive, with a phase velocity lower than that the planar
mode of the homogeneous lattice (see Figure 5, cen-
ter). This slowdown of the mode Γ explains why the
resonant peaks of the Insertion Loss are shifted to-
wards the low frequencies, compared to those of the
homogeneous lattice. A Bragg stop band also appears
for the mode Γ between 509 and 797 Hz (see Figure 5,
top): only the mode Γ′ propagates and the Insertion
Loss curve does not exhibit resonant peaks because
the mode Γ is evanescent. For the mode Γ′, the width
of the the Bragg stop band is reduced to the interval
[797, 839] Hz, where the Insertion Loss vanishes. This
issue could be further investigated.

In these simulations the number of cells of the lat-
tice is limited to n = 5 for the sake of readability of
the Insertion Loss curves.
Indeed, increasing n in-
creases the number of resonant peaks, according to
Equation (46). But it can be checked the computa-
tion does not encounter numerical diﬃculties even for
high n (and/or highly evanescent modes), thanks to
the impedance matrix formalism.

Summarizing the eﬀect of the non-homogeneity in-
duced by the diaphragms, the width of frequency
bands where two modes propagate is reduced, and
therefore the possibility of resonant Insertion Loss as
well.

“Helmholtz stop band”. This band is a resonance stop

that the mode Γ′ (σd = (rd/a2)2 ≈ 0.03), is cut oﬀ
exactly at the upper bound of the Helmholtz stop
band f h
2 . The cut-oﬀ frequencies for the strongly
non-homogeneous lattice are given in Table 3. The
mode Γ propagates at low frequencies and is evanes-
cent for f lying within [284, 797] Hz. This implies
that even a small opening of the diaphragms between
resonators entails that the stop band of the branched
Helmholtz resonators disappears.
In particular, the
singularity of Re(Γh) at fr, which is a characteristic
of the Helmholtz stop band, is lost.

Summarizing the eﬀect of the coupling of the
branched resonators, the two modes have very diﬀer-
ent behaviours for all the frequencies considered. This
tends to limit the Insertion Loss of the strongly non-
homogeneous lattice compared to that of branched
resonators.

7 Conclusion

The analytical approach proposed is able to describe
a wide variety of periodically coupled waveguides.
For two classical examples of applications (homoge-
neous lattices and branched Helmholtz resonators),
the model shows how the frequency behaviour of the
Insertion Loss, can be attributed either to the prop-
erties of the medium (dispersion within the lattice),
or to the boundary conditions and the ﬁnite length.
Moreover, the introduction of a non-homogeneity
within the lattice, by means of an added mass in one of
the waveguides, illustrates how the properties (disper-
sion and Insertion Loss) of the two classical examples
are modiﬁed, and how this can be interpreted.

A coupling coeﬃcient is useful for the study of the
transition between local and non-local reaction of one
waveguide to the other. In practice, the model have
shown that a very small coupling between (locally re-
acting) Helmholtz resonators is suﬃcient to obtain a
lattice where the local reaction vanishes. A particular
situation is encountered when an interaction between
Bragg and Helmholtz stop bands occurs. How this
could be combined with ﬁnite length eﬀects for sound
attenuation purpose could be further investigated.

Other types of non-homogeneity, like the presence

Pachebat and Kergomard, p. 12

of dissipative media (porous materials described as
equivalent ﬂuids) or varying cross sections are in the
scope of the method, provided that coupling of the
evanescent modes created by two singularities does
not occur, i.e., perforations are suﬃciently spaced.

Arguments can be found for ignoring the series
impedance of the perforation, but this restricts ap-
plications to cases where the frequency is low and the
perforation radius is small compared to the waveg-
uides radii. The knowledge of appropriated expres-
sions for series impedance and shunt admittance of
the perforation would be required for practical appli-
cation of the model to a particular geometry. An issue
of interest could be the eﬀects of the series impedance
Za on the properties of a ﬁnite lattice at higher fre-
quencies. Precise values of the perforation admittance
and impedance remain a topic of further investigation,
in particular when the frequency increases. This can
be done either with numerical methods or with mea-
surements.

Application can be done to diﬀerent kind of devices,
such a silencers or sample of 1D metamaterials of ﬁ-
nite length. To a certain extent, it could be possible
to divide their design in two steps: ﬁrst an optimiza-
tion of the Insertion Loss with respect to given values
of the perforation parameters, then a determination
of the geometry corresponding to these parameters.

With the same model, further investigation could
be done on dissipation eﬀects, either in the perfora-
tions or in the waveguides. Mean ﬂow or nonlinear
eﬀects would require diﬀerent models.

Appendix A : Derivation of the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
the transfer matrix

A1 Eigenvalues, dispersion equation

For the sake of simplicity, the eigenvalues λ and eigen-
vectors, denoted WL, are ﬁrst sought for a generic,
asymmetric cell. They are solutions of the 4th-order
equation:

(PFT − λI)W L=O,

(A1)
where O is the zero matrix of 4th-order. Using Equa-
tions (2) and (7), and a calculation based upon sub-
matrices, Equation (A1) can be rewritten as follows:

([(γ1 + γ2M) T1 − λI] WL1 + γ2(I − M)T2WL2 = 0 ,

γ1(I − M)T1WL1 + [(γ2 + γ1M) T2 − λI] WL2 = 0

(A2)

def

= t(cid:0) WL1 WL2(cid:1) .

if WL
Subtracting the two Equations (A2) leads to a new
equation:

(A3)

(MT1 − λI)WL1 = (MT2 − λI)WL2.

(A4)

Then, multiplying in System (A2) the ﬁrst equation
by γ1 and the second equation by γ2, and adding
the resulting equations, the following equation is ob-
tained:

γ1(T1− λI)WL1 = −γ2(T2− λI)WL2
Then, writing for i = 1 and 2:

def
= W0. (A5)

MTi − λI = M(Ti − λI) + λ(M − I) ,

and substituting in Equation (A4) the values of W0
given by Equation (A5), Equation (A4) can be written
as follows:

(M − I) + I+

λ(M − I)(cid:2)γ2(T1 − λI)−1 + γ1(T2 − λI)−1(cid:3) W0 = 0.
Finally, multiplying Equation (A6) by the matrix
2(M − I)−1 = K − I, where K is given by Equa-
tion (4), it is found that the 4th-order Equation (A1)
is equivalent to the following 2nd-order equation:

(A6)

T0W0 = 0 where

(A7)

T0= I + K+2λ(cid:2)γ2(T1 − λI)−1 + γ1(T2 − λI)−1(cid:3)(A8)

Consequently, each eigenvalue λ(i) (i = 1..4) is solu-
tion of the general dispersion equation:

det T0 = A0D0 − B0C0 = 0.

(A9)

Here the coeﬃcients of the matrix T0 are denoted A0,
B0, C0, D0. Equation (A8) gives their expression,
which depends on the eigenvalue λ:

A0 = 1 + 2λ(cid:20) γ2(D1 − λ)

and where
∆1,2 = det(T1,2−λI) = λ2−λ(A1,2 +D1,2)+det T1,2.
(A14)
Equation (A9) is a simpliﬁcation of the dispersion
equation given in [28] (see Equation of this reference).
In the same reference, the expression of the 4th-order
equation for the unknown λ is given (see Equation
(43) of this reference).

A2 Eigenvectors for an asymmetric

cell

The eigenvectors of the matrix PFT (see Equation
(15)) can be obtained thanks to Equation (A5) by de-
termining the 2nd-order vector W0 (Equation (A7)).
For each eigenvalue, this vector is deﬁned apart from
a constant multiplicative value. The following general
form is chosen:

W(i)

0 = v0(cid:18) w(i)

−1 (cid:19) , (i = 1..4)

0

(A15)

where v0 is an arbitrary constant having the dimen-
sion of a velocity, and w(i)
are impedances associ-
0
ated to eigenvalues λ(i). By construction, Expression
(A15) fulﬁlls Equation (A7), which means that for
each eigenvalues λ(i) we have:

w(i)

0 =

B(i)
0
A(i)
0

=

D(i)
0
C(i)

(i = 1..4)).

(A16)

Introducing the general form of W0 (Equation (A15))
into Expression (A5) gives the eigenvectors of an
asymmetric cell of the lattice. For the upper and
lower rows, each column i (i = 1..4) of the matrix
EL (Equation (15)) can be written as:

W(i)

L1 =

W(i)

L2 = −

γ2∆2  w(i)
0 (cid:2)D2 − λ(i)(cid:3) + B2

Finally each column i (i = 1..4) of the matrix EL is
obtained by assembling the 2nd-order vectors W(i)
L1
and W(i)

L2 by Equation (A3).

A3 Eigenvectors for a symmetric cell

The dispersion equation (A9) and the expression
(A17,A18)) of the eigenvectors are general. A more
useful expression can be obtained if the propagation
matrix T is spltted into two matrices in order to get
a symmetric cell (see Section 2.4 and Figure 2). Con-
sequently A0 = D0.

The transfer matrix of a symmetric cell (Equa-
tion (9)) is written in the diagonal form (Equation
(13)):comparing this equation and Equation (13), the
columns of the eigenvector matrix E (Equation (15))
can be obtained from the eigenvectors of the anti-
symmetric cell W (i)

L (Equations (A17,A18)) by:

W (i) =  W(i)

W(i)

2 ! = TLW (i)

with δ1 = det(TL1) = det(TR1). A similar expression
holds for the guide 2, with a sign − before v0. When
the determinants are unity, the eigenvectors are given
by Equation (18).

trix of E (Equation (18)), it is convenient to write its
ﬁrst up-left quarter in the form of a matrix product:

where ui = Sivi (i = 1, 2) are the ﬂow rates. Consid-
ering the eigenvector matrix E (Equation (18)), a per-
mutation of the second and third rows and columns is
required, as well as a permutation of the second and
