Abstract

We study a variable-coeﬃcient nonlinear Schr¨odinger (vc-NLS) equation with higher-

order eﬀects. We show that the breather solution can be converted into four types of

nonlinear waves on constant backgrounds including the multi-peak solitons, antidark soli-

ton, periodic wave and W-shaped soliton. The transition condition requiring the group

velocity dispersion (GVD) and third-order dispersion (TOD) to scale linearly is obtained

analytically. We display several kinds of elastic interactions between the transformed non-

linear waves. We discuss the dispersion management of multi-peak soliton, which indicates

that the GVD coeﬃcient controls the number of peaks of the wave while the TOD coeﬃcient

has compression eﬀect. The gain or loss has inﬂuence on the amplitudes of the multi-peak

soliton. We further derive the breather multiple births by using multiple compression points

of Akhmediev breathers in optical ﬁber systems with periodic dispersion. The number of

ABs depends on the amplitude of the modulation but not on its wavelength, which aﬀects

their separation distance. In the limiting case, the breather multiple births reduce to the

Peregrine combs. We discuss the eﬀects of TOD coeﬃcient on the spatiotemporal char-

acteristics of Peregrine combs. When the amplitude of the modulation is equal to 1, the

Peregrine comb is converted into a Peregrine wall that can be seen as intermediate state

between rogue wave and W-shaped soliton. We ﬁnally ﬁnd that the modulational stabil-

ity regions with zero growth rate coincide with the transition condition using rogue wave

eigenvalues. Our results could be useful for the experimental control and manipulation of

the formation of generalized Peregrine rogue waves in diverse physical systems modeled by

vc-NLS equation with higher-order eﬀects.

1. Introduction

Breathers have gotten a lot of attention due to their interactions and energy exchange with
a constant background [1]. Diﬀerent from the usual soliton dynamics, their interactions can
generate unique behaviors. Breathers can be classiﬁed into two kinds: Kuznetsov-Ma breathers
(KMBs) [2] and Akhmediev breathers (ABs) [3]. KMBs are periodic in space and localized in
time while ABs are periodic in time and localized in space. Taking the period of both breather
solutions to inﬁnity produces a Peregrine soliton (PS) solution [4], which is localized both in
space and time and serves as a prototype of a rogue wave [5]. This wave, which has a peak
amplitude generally more than twice the signiﬁcant wave height, appear from nowhere and
disappear without a trace [6]. It appears as a result of the modulation instability (MI) [7, 8] of a
weakly modulated plane wave. And more speciﬁcally, rogue-wave formation is related to a special
kind of MI, namely, the baseband MI whose bandwidth includes arbitrarily small frequencies [9].
Experimentally, rogue waves have been observed in optical ﬁbers [10], water-wave tanks [11], and
plasmas [12]. In spite of many integrable equations have been shown to admit the rogue wave
solutions, in theory, the standard nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS) equation is seen as a basic model
for the dynamics of rogue waves, both in water and optics.

In optical communications, there always exist some nonuniformities due to various factors
that include the imperfection of manufacture, variation in the lattice parameters of the ﬁber
media and ﬂuctuation of the ﬁber diameters [13]. Those nonuniformities often lead to such ef-
fects as the ﬁber gain or loss, phase modulation, and variable dispersion [14]. The inclusion
of the variable coeﬃcients into the NLS equations is currently an eﬀective way to reﬂect the
inhomogeneous eﬀects of the nonlinear optical pulses [15]. On the other hand, if the dispersion
and nonlinear eﬀect in a mode-locked ﬁber laser is very strong, the pulse parameters such as the
width, chirp, phase and position will change signiﬁcantly from their initial values [16]. Thus,
the concept of soliton dispersion management and soliton control in a ﬁber, which is used to
address this problem, has been recently proposed. The dispersion management of soliton is often
modeled by the NLS equations with varying dispersion and nonlinear coeﬃcients along with a
gain or loss coeﬃcient [17]. Compared with a conventional soliton, this type of soliton can not
only be accelerated but also be ampliﬁed preserving its shape and elastic character, which makes
it more suitable for diverse physical applications [16]. Diﬀerent from the nonlinear evolution
equations with constant coeﬃcients, the rogue waves and breather in variable-coeﬃcient ones
can show some novel features such as the nonlinear tunneling eﬀect, recurrence, annihilation and
sustainment [18–20], to name a few. Recent studies have also reported the breather evolution,
ampliﬁcation and compression, Talbot-like eﬀects and composite rogue wave structures in some
variable-coeﬃcient nonlinear evolution equations [21]. Moreover, Tiofack et al. have demon-
strated a novel multiple compression points structure in periodically modulated NLS equations,
which is termed as Peregrine comb [22]. Additionally, the studies of the control and manipulation
of the rogue waves in variable-coeﬃcient models may help to manage them experimentally in

3

inhomogeneous optical ﬁbers [20, 23] and Bose-Einstein condensates [18, 24], and also provide a
good ﬁt between the theoretical analysis and real applications in future spatial observations and
laboratory plasma experiments [25].

The propagation of a picosecond optical pulse is usually described by the standard NLS
equation. However, for the propagation of a subpicosecond or femtosecond pulse, the higher-
order eﬀects such as the third order dispersion, self-steepening, and delayed nonlinear response
should be taken into account [26], which makes the modiﬁcation of the NLS equation as a more
accurate prototype of the wave evolution in the real world. These eﬀects may add qualitatively
certain new properties to the wave propagation phenomena, e.g., to breathers, rogue waves and
MI. Akhmediev et al. have shown that a breather solution of the third- and ﬁfth-order NLS
equations can be converted into a nonpulsating soliton solution on a background, which does
not exist in the standard NLS equation [27, 28]. Wang et al. have discovered that the breather
solutions in the NLS equation with four-order dispersion and nonlinear terms can be transformed
into diﬀerent types of nonlinear waves and the interactions between these waves are elastic [29].
Such transitions have also been reported in the higher-order coupled systems including the Hirota-
Maxwell-Bloch (HMB) system [30] and NLS and NLS-MB system with four-order eﬀects [31]. He
et al. have found that the higher-order terms control compression eﬀects of the breather and
rogue waves [32]. With such higher-order perturbation terms as the TOD and delayed nonlinear
response term, Liu et al. have found that the MI growth rate shows a nonuniform distribution
characteristic in the low perturbation frequency region, which opens up a stability region as the
background frequency changes [33]. They have further exhibited an intriguing transition between
bright-dark rogue waves and W-shaped-anti-W-shaped solitons, which occurs as a result of the
attenuation of MI growth rate to vanishing in the zerofrequency perturbation region [34].

In this paper, we consider a variable-coeﬃcient NLS (vc-NLS) equation with higher-order

eﬀects as follows [35–37]

where z is the propagation variable, t is the retarded time in a moving frame with the group
velocity, and q(z, t) is the slowly varying envelope of the wave ﬁeld. The coeﬃcients d2(z), R(z),
d3(z), γ(z) and Γ(z) represent the GVD eﬀect, Kerr nonlinear eﬀect, TOD eﬀect, the time-delay
correlation to the cubic term and the gain or loss eﬀect respectively. Liu et al. have studied
the two-soliton interactions of Eq. (1) analytically and numerically, and discussed the higher-
order-eﬀects management of soliton interactions [36]. He et al. have investigated the control and
manipulation of the rogue waves of Eq. (1) [37].

Our goals here are twofold: (1) the breather transition dynamics and nonlinear wave manage-
ment; (2) the breather multiple births and the Peregrine combs/walls. We ﬁrst present intriguing
diﬀerent kinds of nonlinear localized and periodic waves, including the multi-peak soliton, W-
shaped soliton and periodic wave. With the multi-peak soliton, for example, we discuss the
eﬀects of GVD coeﬃcient, TOD coeﬃcient and gain or loss coeﬃcient. We further reveal the
relation between such transition and MI characteristics. On the other hand, considering periodic
modulation, we display three types of multiple compression points structures, the breather mul-
tiple births, Peregrine combs and Peregrine walls whose spatiotemporal characteristics are also
analyzed analytically.

The arrangement of the paper is as follows: In Sec. 2, we will present diﬀerent types of
transformed nonlinear waves of Eq. (1), show their interactions, and analyze the eﬀects of variable
coeﬃcients. In addition, the transition condition will be given analytically. The relation between
the MI growth rate and transition condition will be revealed in Sec. 3. The Peregrine comb/wall
structures as well as their spatiotemporal characteristics will be studied in Sec. 4. Finally, Sec.
5 will be the conclusions of this paper.

In this section, we mainly study the breather transition dynamics for Eq. (1). By virtue of

and R(z) − I (z)hI

From the above expression, one can ﬁnd that the breather solution (3) is composed of the hyper-
bolic functions sinh(z VT + t hI) (cosh(z VT + t hI)) and trigonometric functions sin(z VH + t hR)
(cos(z VH + t hR)), where R(z) + I (z)hR
are the corresponding velocities.
The hyperbolic functions and trigonometric functions describe the localization and periodicity
of the transverse distribution t of those waves, respectively. The nonlinear wave described by
the solution (3) could be seen as a nonlinear superposition of a soliton and a periodic wave. The
period of the breather along t-coordinate axis is determined by π
which is related to the eigen-
hR
value λ = α + β i. Compared with the Hirota equation with constant coeﬃcients, the breather
solution (3) of the inhomogeneous Hirota equation (1) includes the variable dispersion (d2(z)),
nonlinearity (R(z)), higher-order eﬀects (d3(z) and γ(z)) and gain or loss (Γ(z)). More speciﬁ-
2Γ(z)), which
cally, the intensity of the breather is controlled by c(z) =
means that we can manipulate the intensity by adjusting the gain or loss coeﬃcient or the ratio
of dispersion and nonlinearity. In addition, it is observed that VT and VH are associated with
the GVD eﬀect d2(z) and TOD eﬀect d3(z) that aﬀect the velocity of the breather. Thus, we
will study the dynamics of the breather described by the solution (3) depending on the above
parameters.

ABs with |β| < 1, the KMBs with |β| > 1, and the PS with |β| = 1. Those solutions have been
obtained via the similarity transformation [37].

Conversely, if I(z) = 0, the soliton and periodic wave in the solution (3) have the same

i.e.,

The condition (4) indicates that the extrema of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions in the
solution (3) is located along the same straight lines in the (z, t)-plane, which leads to the trans-
formation of the breather into diﬀerent types of nonlinear waves on constant backgrounds. The
equivalent form of the condition (4), namely Eq. (5), involves four parameters: the frequency of
plane wave n, the real part of the eigenvalue α, and the GVD eﬀect d2(z) and TOD eﬀect d3(z).
When d2(z) is proportional to d3(z) (d2(z) = k d3(z), k (cid:54)= 0), Eq. (5) has solutions. However,
if d2(z) = k(z) d3(z) (k(z) is a function of z), Eq. (5) has no solution. This means that the
constraint d2(z) = k d3(z) is the necessary conditions for the existence of transformed nonlinear

waves. For a ﬁxed n, increasing the value of d2(z)
Fig. 1.

d3(z) results in an decrease of α. This is plotted in

Figure 1: Solutions of Eq. (5) on a plane of (n, α).

Under the transition condition (5), we exhibit four kinds of transformed nonlinear waves on
constant backgrounds including the multi-peak solitons [Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)], antidark soliton
(Fig. 2(c)), periodic wave [Fig. 2(d)] and W-shaped soliton [Fig. 2(e)]. These types of nonlinear
waves have been found not only in the scalar equations including Hirota equation [27], four-order
NLS equation [29], ﬁfth-order NLS equation [28], but also in the coupled systems such as the
NLS-MB system [38], HMB system [30] and AB system [39]. The diﬀerence between Fig. 2(a)
and Fig. 2(b) is that the former shows the single main peak while the latter displays the double
main peaks. In order to more clearly reveal the regularity of transformation between these two
zz as a control variable. The maximum amplitude of |q(z, t)|2 at (0, 0)
waves, we consider |q(0, 0)|2
can be presented analytically [in Fig. 2(a)],

|q(0, 0)|2 = exp(Γ(z))(2 β + 1)2 ,

(6)

which is related to the imaginary part of eigenvalue β and gain/loss Γ(z). Unfortunately, due
to the complexity of |q(0, 0)|2
zz, it’s diﬃcult to give it’s expression analytically. Thus, we only
demonstrate the eﬀect of β on |q(0, 0)|2
zz numerically. As shown in Fig. 3, the green line (−1.28 <
β < 0) corresponds to the case |q(0, 0)|2
zz > 0 that means the ordinate origin (0, 0) is a minimum
and the soliton has two main peaks with identical amplitude. Nevertheless, if the value of β
exceeds a certain range, i.e., β > 0 or β < −1.28, the value of |q(0, 0)|2
zz is less than zero, which
results in the formation of one main peak. Consequently, the transition between these two kinds
of waves can be governed by the imaginary part of eigenvalue β.

Next, we display two special nonlinear wave structures from the solution (3), i.e., the an-
tidark soliton and periodic wave. The former exists in isolation when hR vanishes, while the
latter independently exists when hI vanishes. Therefore, the antidark soliton and periodic wave
are shown in forms of exponential and trigonometric functions respectively. Speciﬁcally, the
analytical expressions read as, for the soliton,

The antidark soliton was ﬁrstly reported in the scalar NLS system with the third-order dispersion
[40]. Recently, the similar structures have also been found in such coupled models as NLS-MB
system [38], HMB system [30] and AB system [39]. The soliton depicted in Fig. 2(c) lies on a
plane-wave background with a peak c(z)2(1 + 2 β)2 and will become a standard bright soliton as
c(z) → 0. Fig. 2(d) shows the periodic wave with the period P = π
. Interestingly, in spite of
the same expression, the wave in Fig. 2(d) looks like a higher-order wave. When the period hR
is close to zero, namely, β → 1, the periodic wave will reduce to a W-shaped soliton, as shown
in Fig. 2(e). In this case, the solution (8) is transformed into

By using the solution (10) and transition condition (5), we can obtain various nonlinear in-
teractions among diﬀerent types of transformed nonlinear waves. For more detailed analysis of
these nonlinear interactions, one can refer to Refs. [29, 30, 34]. Hereby, we only exhibit a few
typical examples. Figs. 4(a)∼4(c) describe the interactions between two multi-peak solitons,
and between the periodic wave and antidark soliton. We note that the collisions are elastic,
i.e., the waves restore the original shapes, amplitudes and velocities after each collision with a
small phase shift. On the other hand, employing the semirational forms of the solution (10) and
transition condition (5), we have the interactions between the W-shpaed soliton and the antidark
soliton, and between two W-shaped soitons, which are depicted in Fig. 5.

B. Dispersion management and nonlinear management
We discuss the eﬀects of the variable coeﬃcients on the nonlinear waves, i.e., the dispersion
management and nonlinear management. Here we will pay our attention to the multi-peak soliton
with single main peak. We omit the results on other types of nonlinear waves, since the eﬀects
of the variable coeﬃcients on them are similar to the multi-peak soliton with the same initial
physical parameters. From the constraints (2), we note that ﬁve variable coeﬃcients d2(z), d3(z),
R(z), γ(z) and Γ(z) are not independent of each other. The ratio of d2(z) and R(z) must be
equal to that of d3(z) and γ(z). Additionally, Γ(z) should be expressed by d2(z) and R(z) (or
d3(z) and γ(z)). Therefore, we will consider dispersion management and nonlinear management
of the multi-peak soliton under the integrability condition (2).

We ﬁrst study the eﬀect of TOD coeﬃcient d3(z) and time-delay correlation to the cubic
term γ(z) on the multi-peak soliton. We ﬁx the values of d2(z) and R(z) while change the values
of d3(z) and γ(z). For simplicity, we set Γ(z) = 0. As shown in Fig. 6, we observe a compressed
eﬀect of the multi-peak soliton by increasing the values of d3(z) and γ(z).
In other words,
a further increase of the values of d3(z) and γ(z) leads to stronger localization and a smaller
oscillation period. However, the amplitudes of the multi-peak soliton including the maximum
and minimum ones do not change markedly, especially for the main peak. It’s worth pointing
out that we have to increase or decrease the values of d3(z) and γ(z) simultaneously to ensure
the integrability condition (2) to be true.

2 = 0.2 + 0.6 i.

Secondly, we investigate how the GVD coeﬃcient d2(z) and Kerr nonlinear coeﬃcient R(z)
inﬂuence on the multi-peak soliton. In this case, the values of d3(z) and γ(z) cannot be changed
and d2(z) and R(z) are various. From Fig. 7, we discover that increasing the values of d2(z)
and R(z) also results in stronger localization and a smaller oscillation period for the multi-peak
soliton. More interestingly, diﬀerent from the TOD eﬀects, the GVD coeﬃcient can aﬀect the
peak number of the multi-peak soliton. When d2(z) = R(z) = 1, the soliton has seven humps
(see the dotted line in Fig. 7). By raising the values of d2(z) and R(z), we can observe that the
humps of the soliton increase from seven to thirteen (see the solid line in Fig. 7). Further, by
compare with the main peak, the amplitudes of secondary ones increase obviously.

1, k2 = −1, λ1 = λ∗

2 = 0.2 + 0.6 i.

Thirdly, we discuss the eﬀects of the gain/loss coeﬃcient Γ(z). It should be pointed out that
the GVD coeﬃcient d2(z) and Kerr nonlinear coeﬃcient R(z) need to meet non-linear relation
(d2(z) = k(z) R(z), k(z) is a function of z) because the case d2(z) = k R(z) will lead to the
vanishing gain/loss eﬀect. Based on the fact that decreasing GVD in a ﬁber has been realized,
as an example, we consider an exponential dispersion decreasing ﬁber system with

d2(z) = δ1 exp(ξ z),

d3(z) = δ3 exp(ξ z),

R(z) = δ1,

γ(z) = δ3,

(12)

12

Γ(z) = ξ ,

(13)

where δ1 (δ3) is the parameter related to the Kerr nonlinear (TOD) and ξ denotes the constant
net gain or loss. Fig. 8 describes the propagation of a multi-peak soliton whose amplitudes,
background and velocity vary due to the nonvanishing gain or loss. From the expression (3),
we see that the amplitudes of the multi-peak soliton are determined by c(z) = exp(ξ t), and
the velocity is inﬂuenced by d2(z) = δ1 exp(ξ z), d3(z) = δ3 exp(ξ z). If ξ > 0, the amplitude of
this wave will increase exponentially whereas it will decrease exponentially. In addition, we ob-
serve that the multi-peak soliton is compressed during the propagation owing to the exponential
dispersion decreasing coeﬃcients. The cases ξ < 0 and ξ > 0, respectively, correspond to the
compression and ampliﬁcation.

Finally, we consider a soliton management system similar to that of Ref. [41], i.e., the

periodic distributed system

R(z) = δ1 sin(ξ z) ,

d2(z) = δ2 sin(ξ z) ,

d3(z) = δ3 sin(ξ z) ,

γ(z) =

δ1δ3
δ2

sin(ξ z) . (14)

Trigonometric functions are physically relevant because they provide for alternating regions of
positive and negative dispersion and nonlinearity, indicated in the improved stability of the
solitons [10]. The periodically accelerating or decelerating multi-peak soliton are shown in Fig .
9(a). The two solitons in Fig. 9(b) propagate with periodic oscillation along the time z, and
the separated solitons collide periodically.

3. MI characteristics

In this section, we reveal the explicit relation between the transition and the distribution
characteristics of MI growth rate for Eq. (1). Eq. (1) admits the following continuous wave
solutions,

(cid:115)

q(z, t) = c(z) ei (m(z)+n t) =

d2(z)
R(z)

ei (m(z)+n t) ,

(15)

(16)

where n are real parameters. A perturbed nonlinear background can be expressed as

into Eq. (1) yields the evolution equation for the perturbations as

(cid:16)
− i R(z)(cid:98)q d2(z)z + d2(z)2R(z)
− 6 i(cid:98)qt + 3 i n2(cid:98)qt + 3 n(cid:98)qtt − i(cid:98)qttt

(cid:1) + i(cid:0)(cid:98)q R(z)z + 2R(z)(cid:98)qz
Noting the linearity of Eq. (17) with respect to(cid:98)q, we introduce
(cid:98)q(z, t) = u c(z) ei (Q t−ω(z)) + v c(z) e−i (Q t−ω∗(z)) ,

(17)

(18)

which is characterized by the wave number ω and frequency Q. Using Eq. (18) into Eq. (17)
gives a linear homogeneous system of equations for u and v:

d2(z) − n Q d2(z) − 1
Q2 d2(z) + 6 n d3(z) + 6 Q d3(z)

d2(z) + 6 n d3(z) = 0.

(20)
From the determinant of the coeﬃcient matrix of Eqs. (19)∼(20), the dispersion relation for the
linearized disturbance can be determined as

nQd2(z)(cid:0)d3(z)(cid:0)Q3 − 6n2Q(cid:1) + 2ωz(z)(cid:1) + 2Qd3(z)(cid:0)3n2 + Q2 − 6(cid:1) ωz(z)

|Q|(cid:112)(d2(z) + 6 d3(z) n)2 (−4 + Q2). (22)

In this case, the wave number ω(z) becomes complex and the disturbance will grow with time
exponentially if and only if Q < Qc = 2, and the growth rate of the instability is given by

Solving the above equation, we have

ω(z) = Q

To obtain the maximum growth rate of the instability, we take the derivative of Eq. (23) with
2 and the following maximum growth
respect to Q, and set it to zero. Then, we obtain Qmax =
rate of the instability:

Ω(z)max =(cid:112)(d2(z) + 6 d3(z) n)2.

0.04. Here the dashed red lines represent the stability region in the perturbation frequency region −2 < Q < 2 ,
which is given as n = − d2(z)
6 d3(z) .

The eﬀects of the TOD coeﬃcient on the growth rate of instability is demonstrated in Fig.
10, from which we discover that the value of Ω(z) increases with the value of d3(z). Fig. 11
shows the characteristics of MI on the (Q, n) plane. It is found that the MI exists in the region
−2 < Q < 2. Hereby, we discover that the MI growth rate distribution is symmetric with respect
to

n = − d2(z)
6 d3(z)

,

(25)

i.e., The red dashed line in Fig. 11 corresponds to a modulational stability (MS) region where the
growth rate is vanishing in the low perturbation frequency region. More interestingly, using the
rogue wave eigenvalue, one can ﬁnd that the MS condition (25) is consistent with the condition
(5) which converts breathers into nonlinear waves on constant backgrounds. Our ﬁnding suggests
that the transition between breathers and nonlinear waves can occur in the MS region with the
low frequency perturbations. Further, by comparison with Fig. 11(a), we discover that the lower
value of d3(z) corresponds to the lower value of n. Therefore, the MS region moves down, which
is displayed in Fig. 11(b).

4. Breather multiple births and Peregrine combs/walls

In this section, we will study the breather solution (3) in detail, and describe its main

properties when the GVD coeﬃcient is of the form

d2(z) = c R(z) = −1 + dc cos(kc z) ,

(26)

where dc denotes the amplitude of modulation and kc is spatial frequency. Such periodic modu-
lations have realized experimentally in Ref. [42].

The spatiotemporal characteristics of the breather multiple births described by the solution
(3) are illustrated in Fig. 12, i.e., the triplets structure with dc = 2.5 and the septuplets structure

16

wtih dc = 8.5. These structures show multiple compression points, located at diﬀerent values of
z and t. The number of the ABs in the breather multiple births depends on the amplitude of
the modulation but not on its wavelength, which controls their separation distance. Increasing
the value of dc will lead to the formation of (3 + 4 k)-births for k = 2, 3, . . .. With the similar
modulation parameters selected, these multiple births structures have been also reported in the
vc-NLS equation, the vc-DNLS equation, and the vc-NLS-MB system. The diﬀerence is, however,
that the phase shifts of the ABs on the sides of the center occur along t-direction because of
the TOD eﬀect (for example, see Fig. 12(a)), which don’t exist in the vc-NLS equation without
higher-order eﬀect.

If λ = α + β i → − n

2 + i, we can obtain another type of multiple compression point
structure, namely the Peregrine combs that are the limiting case of the breather multiple births.
The Peregrine comb solution can be given by

qcomb(z, t) = eiρ(cid:16)

(cid:17)

1 + 4 Z 2

,

(27)

with

Zc = −z +

dc
kc

sin(kc z) , M = t + 6 z d3(z) .

From the above expression, we see that the Peregrine comb solution (27) includes the gain or
loss Γ(z) that controls the amplitude, and TOD coeﬃcient d3(z) that aﬀect the spatial-temporal
distribution. The Peregrine combs were ﬁrst found in the vc-NLS equation [22], and then were
also found in the vc-coupled Hirota equations [43]. These phenomena do not take place in the
standard AB or PS without variable dispersion, which contain only one compression point. The
maximum value of this wave’s amplitude is obtained at t = −6 d3(z)z and is given as follow

|qcomb|2

max(z) = |qcomb(z,−6 d3(z)z)|2 =

(1 − 4 Z 2

1 + 4 Z 2

+ c(z)2 + 4 ,

with

Zc = −z (1 − dc
kc z

sin(kc z)) .

(28)

(29)

The GVD coeﬃcient d2(z) or TOD coeﬃcient d3(z) has on eﬀect on the maximum intensity of
the Peregrine comb, which is related to the gain or loss coeﬃcient Γ(z). From the equation (39),
we ﬁnd that |qcomb|2
max(z) reaches its maximal value (c(z) + 2)2 at Zc = 0. This means that the
compression points of the Peregrine comb are located at z0 = 0, zi (i = 1, 2, . . .), where zi satisfy
the following equaiton

sin(kczi)

kczi

=

1
dc

.

(30)

Eq. (30) shows that the larger the value of dc is, the more compression points will be. For example,
Fig. 13(a) displays a Peregrine comb with triple tooth of Eq. (1) with dc = 2.5, and Fig. 13(c)
is plotted for a Peregrine comb with seven tooth with dc = 8.5. The detailed generation process
of Peregrine combs with seven tooth can refer to the explanations for the vc-NLS equation in
Ref. [22].

In order to explore the dynamics of the Peregrine comb, we calculate some physical quantities
of the Peregrine comb analytically. The maximum points, intersection angle θ and the distance
between A and B can be presented as follows

(33)

Bases on the above analytic expressions, we ﬁnd that the TOD eﬀect d3(z) plays an important
role in the spatiotemporal characteristics of the Peregrine comb. Increasing the values of d3(z)
will increase the distance between A and B while decrease the intersection angle θ, which is
shown in Fig. 14. If d3(z) is equal to zero, the Peregrine comb in Fig. 14 will degenerate into
the case in Ref. [22].

In order to reveal further the characteristics of the Peregrine comb, we introduce the energy

of light pulse against the plane-wave background with the form [22, 44]

∆ Ic(z, t) = |qP S(z, t)|2 − c(z)2 = 4

F+ F− − c(z) K+ K−

F+ = 4 t2 + 4 Z 2 + (1 + 12 z d3(z))2 + t(4 + 48 z d3(z)) ,
K− = −1 + 4 Z 2 + 4 (t + 6 z d3(z))2 ,
K+ = 1 + 4 Z 2 + 4 (t + 6 z d3(z))2 .

One can easily check

∆ Ic(z, t)dt = 0 ,

(36)

for all values of z. This implies that the energy of the pump is preserved along the ﬁber, in spite
of periodic modulation characteristics and TOD eﬀect added. In addition, Eq. (35) also reﬂects
the fact that the light intensity of the Peregrine comb will be sometimes higher and sometimes
lower than the background intensity, as shown in Fig. 15. Moreover, we can calculate the energy
of the Peregrine pulse

which indicates that the energy of the pulse is maximal at the compression points Zc = 0 (also
see Fig. 16).

Figure 16: Pulse energy Epulse(z) with kc = 2, dc = 2.5.

Next, we consider another special case of the generalized PS solution, namely the Peregrine
walls. From the equation (31), we note that the amplitude of modulation dc and spatial frequency
kc also aﬀect the positions of two of maximum points, i.e., (∓ arccos( 1

particular, we consider a special case in which the amplitude of modulation dc is set to be 1.
This will result in the case arccos( 1
) = 0. Thus, these two maximum points will be shifted to
dc
the origin and these three PSs will be aggregated together. In this case, the Peregrine comb
solution (37) turns into the form of

As depicted in Fig. 17, the Peregrine comb is converted into a Peregrine wall when the three
maximum points have the same coordinate (0, 0). Generally, the fusion of three PSs will produce
a second-order rogue wave with higher amplitude in the nonlinear equation of evolutions with
constant coeﬃcients. However, the variable coeﬃcients provide much richer patterns. The Pere-
grine wall can be seen as an intermediate state between the rogue wave and W-shaped soliton
because rogue wave has a shorter life while W-shaped soliton has a long one. Such structure
looks like a quasi-trapezoidal in shape. The values of the hump and valleys of the Peregrine wall,
respectively, are equal to (c(z) + 2)2 and 0. To illustrate the eﬀect of TOD coeﬃcient on the
Peregrine wall, we plot Fig. 18. It is observed that the length of the wave increases with growing
value of d3(z), and the depth and angle decreases. In fact, similar to the Peregrine comb, the
Peregrine wall can also be viewed as the limiting case of a breath-type wall that is described in
Fig. 19. On the other hand, to illustrate how to build a Peregrine wall from a PS, we plot Fig.
20 with diﬀerent values of dc. As dc increases, the lifetime of the PS gets much longer. When
dc is equal to 1, the PS eventually becomes a Peregrine wall. When dc is greater than 1, the PS
will show multiple compression points, i.e., it turns into the Peregrine comb [22].

It is well known that the Peregrine rogue wave spectrum features a triangular shape and
gets dramatically broadened at the maximally compressed peak. To end this section, we consider
the spectral property of the Peregrine combs and walls. From Fig. 21(a), we observe that the
rogue wave in Eq. (1) begin with narrow spectral components as the constant-coeﬃcient ones, but
spreads and shrinks during the evolution along the ﬁber, and eventually restore its initial shape.
Each nonlinear spreading in the spectrum is related to a corresponding maximal compression
point. Therefore, the number of spectral components increases with the amplitude of modulation,
which is displayed in Fig. 21(b). Fig. 21(c) shows the spectrum of the Peregrine wall. It is
observed that the width of nonlinear spreading are obviously greater than that of the Peregrine
comb.

5. Conclusions

We have carried out the analytical investigations on the vc-NLS equation with higher-order
eﬀects. The breathers solution have been shown that they can be converted into the multi-peak
solitons (single and double main peaks), antidark soliton, periodic wave and W-shaped soliton.
The transition condition depending on the eigenvalue, GVD coeﬃcient and TOD coeﬃcient has
been given analytically. We have demonstrated that diﬀerent types of nonlinear waves can coexist
and interact with each other elastically. We have further revealed the eﬀects of the variable
coeﬃcients on the multi-peak solitons: (1) The GVD coeﬃcient controls the number of peaks of
the wave; (2) The TOD coeﬃcient accounts for the compressed eﬀects of the wave; (3) The gain
or loss coeﬃcient is responsible for the amplitude of the wave. The transition between breathers
and nonlinear waves occurs in the MS region with the low frequency perturbations. We have
shown that, under the suitable periodic modulations, the Peregrine combs and Peregrine walls
are formed. We have discovered that the TOD coeﬃcient has inﬂuence on the spatiotemporal
characteristics of the Peregrine combs and Peregrine walls. Our results could provide certain
theoretical assistance to the experimental control and manipulation of generalized rogue wave
dynamics in inhomogeneous ﬁber.

λ is the spectral parameter and Φ is the eigenfunction. Through direct computations, it can be
veriﬁed that the equation Uz − Vt + [U, V ] = 0 exactly yields Eqs. (1).

By using the transformation Φ[n] = T Φ, we obtain the new Lax pair Φ[n]

t = U [n] Φ[n], U [n] =
z = V [n] Φ[n], V [n] = (Tz + T V )T −1, where T is a 2 × 2 matrix determined by

z − V [n]

t + [U [n], V [n]] = T (Uz − Vt + [U, V ])T −1.

(Tt + T U )T −1, Φ[n]
the above relations U [n]

This implies that, in order to keep Lax Pair (A1) invariant under the transformation, it is
crucial to seek a matrix T such that U [n] and V [n] have the same forms as those of U and V . In
addition, the old potentials q are mapped into new ones q[n].

Next, we shall construct the n-fold vc-modiﬁed Darboux transformation of Eqs. (1). Hereby,

we assume Matrix Tn be the form of

n(cid:88)

Tn = Tn(λ; λ1, λ2, ..., λ2n) =

Ml λn−l ,

(A3)

where Matrices Ml (l = 0, 1, 2, ..., n−1) are solved by Cramer’s rule, λk = αk+i β (k = 1, 2, ..., 2n)
denote the spectral parameters and Mn is an identity matrix.
