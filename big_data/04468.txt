Violations of CPT invariance can induce neutrino-to-antineutrino transitions. We study this
eﬀect for solar neutrinos and use the upper bound on the solar neutrino-to-antineutrino transition
probability from the KamLAND experiment to constrain CPT-symmetry-violating coeﬃcients of
the general Standard-Model Extension. The long propagation distance from the Sun to the Earth
allows us to improve existing limits by factors ranging from about a thousand to 1011.

INTRODUCTION

After escaping the Sun, neutrinos propagate in vac-
uum approximately 150 million km before reaching our
detectors on Earth [1–7]. Although solar neutrinos of all
three ﬂavors are expected to reach us due to ﬂavor mix-
ing, no antiparticle counterparts are expected. Borexino
[8], KamLAND [9, 10], SNO [11], and Super-Kamiokande
[12] have performed systematic searches for electron an-
tineutrinos (¯νe) coming from the Sun. The absence of a
positive signal has been used to constrain the parame-
ters of models beyond standard mass-ﬂavor mixing, that
could trigger the transition of a neutrino into an antineu-
trino.

Deviations from exact Lorentz invariance could pro-
duce several unconventional eﬀects in neutrino exper-
iments [13]. One interesting eﬀect is the mixing be-
tween neutrinos and antineutrinos triggered by Majorana
couplings in the Standard-Model Extension (SME) [14–
16]. This mixing can lead to diﬀerent experimental sig-
natures. Limits on some of the controlling coeﬃcients
have been obtained from neutrinoless double beta de-
cay experiments [17], and neutrino-antineutrino oscilla-
tions have been explored in accelerator and reactor ex-
periments [18, 19].

In this work, we use the results from solar-neutrino ex-
periments to determine the most stringent limits on the
coeﬃcients for Lorentz and CPT violation that would
produce νe → ¯νe oscillations. The long propagation dis-
tance makes solar neutrinos highly sensitive to minuscule
eﬀects that are enhanced by the baseline.

This paper is organized as follows.

II the
general theory of Lorentz-violating neutrinos is reviewed,
while the relevant transition probability is determined in
Sec. III. In Sec. IV the choice of reference frame is dis-
cussed so the theory can be applied in Sec. V. Section
VI concludes with a summary.

In Sec.

II. THEORY

Lorentz-violating neutrinos and antineutrinos in the
SME are eﬀectively described by the Lagrangian density
[20, 21]

L = 1

2 Ψ(cid:0)i/∂ − M + ˆQ(cid:1)Ψ + h.c.,

(1)

where the multiplet Ψ = (νe, νµ, ντ , νC
τ )T in-
cludes the states of three neutrinos and their charge con-
jugates, M is a mass matrix, and the generic operator
for Lorentz violation ˆQ can be decomposed in a basis of
Dirac matrices in the general form [21]

e , νC

µ , νC

ˆQ = ˆS + i ˆPγ5 + ˆV λγλ + ˆAλγ5γλ + 1

2

ˆT λησλη.

(2)

Each of the elements in this expansion are 6 × 6 matri-
ces, which can be further decomposed into 3 × 3 blocks
of Dirac and Majorana type [21]. Dirac components af-
fect neutrinos and antineutrinos independently, whereas
Majorana components induce neutrino-antineutrino mix-
ing. From the Lagrangian (1) an eﬀective Hamiltonian
can be constructed. A seesaw mechanism for neutrino
masses is then implemented, which suppresses the prop-
agation of sterile states. The full Hamiltonian incor-
porates a conventional Lorentz-invariant part and the
Lorentz-violating piece. The latter involves only the
Dirac part of the vector ˆV λ and axial vector ˆAλ compo-
nents as well as the Majorana part of the tensor compo-
nent ˆT λη; scalar ˆS and pseudoscalar ˆP components are
irrelevant at leading order [21]. The Dirac-type terms
modify the propagation and mixing of neutrinos and an-
tineutrinos independently in the form of two coeﬃcients
denoted (aL)λ and (cL)λη, which control CPT-odd and
CPT-even Lorentz violation, respectively. These coeﬃ-
cients have been studied in a variety of accelerator, atmo-
spheric, and reactor oscillation experiments [22–30] and
a recent study searched for key signatures in double beta
decay [31]. All experimental results are tabulated in Ref.
[32].

The relevant tensor component of the eﬀective Hamil-

tonian depends on two coeﬃcients denoted egλη and eH λ,

which control CPT-odd and CPT-even Lorentz viola-
tion, respectively. These coeﬃcients produce the mixing
of left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos,
leading to the possibility of neutrino-antineutrino oscilla-
tions. This experimental signature has been studied us-
ing accelerator neutrinos in the MINOS experiment [18]
and antineutrinos in the Double Chooz reactor experi-
ment [19].

We remark in passing that in realistic ﬁeld theories, op-
erators that break CPT invariance are a subset of those
that break Lorentz symmetry [33]. For this reason, here-
after when we refer to CPT violation it is understood
that Lorentz invariance is also broken.

The relevant Hamiltonian is given by [20, 34]

δH ¯αβ = i√2(ǫ+)∗

λ(cid:2) ˆpσEegλσ

¯αβ(cid:3),
¯αβ − eH λ

¯αβ and eH λ

where the generation indices ¯α ∈ {¯e, ¯µ, ¯τ}, β ∈ {e, µ, τ}
have been included in the coeﬃcients for Lorentz viola-
tion egλσ
¯αβ. The other quantities in this Hamil-
tonian are the neutrino energy E, (ǫ+)λ is a polariza-
tion 4-vector, and ˆpσ = (1,−ˆp) is a parametrization of
the neutrino direction of propagation. Due to the her-
miticity of the full 6 × 6 Hamiltonian and its transfor-
mation properties under charge conjugation, the coeﬃ-
cients for CPT-even Lorentz violation are antisymmetric
¯βα. Similarly, the
dimensionless coeﬃcients for CPT-odd Lorentz violation
¯βα [20].
These symmetry properties will play an important role
in the evaluation of the oscillation probability in Sec. III.
In fact, it will be shown that the oscillation probability
involves a symmetric combination of coeﬃcients, mak-
ing only the symmetric part of the Hamiltonian relevant.
In other words, the coeﬃcients eH α
¯αβ are unobservable in
the oscillation channel νj → ¯νe. For this reason, we will
rewrite the Lorentz-violating Hamiltonian (3) simply as
δH ¯αβ = i√2(ǫ+)∗

III. OSCILLATION PROBABILITY

The appearance of electron antineutrinos from the
Sun could be interpreted as caused by Lorentz violation,
which could make a left-handed electron neutrino oscil-
late into a right-handed antineutrino. The absence of a
signal of the transition νe → ¯νe over such a long propa-
gation distance implies that the relevant coeﬃcients for
Lorentz violation are very small.

The description of neutrinos moving through the Sun
requires the incorporation of matter eﬀects. For the ﬁrst
∼ 700.000 km, the propagation through a medium of
electron density ne(r) is dominated by the matter poten-
tial V (r) = √2 GF ne(r) that modiﬁes the mixing angles,
making them a function of the vacuum mixing angles, the
neutrino energy, and position through the matter poten-
tial. Given the existing constraints on the coeﬃcients
egλσ
¯αβ [18, 19], CPT-violating eﬀects in the propagation
through the solar interior can be safely neglected. The
role of egλσ
¯αβ is to produce unconventional transitions in
the vacuum propagation of neutrinos to Earth. There-
fore, the νe → ¯νe transition probability can be factorized
into two terms, one describing the neutrino propagation
from the solar core to the surface, and the other charac-
terizing the evolution in vacuum from the surface of the
Sun to Earth in the form

Pνe→¯νe =Xj

νe→νj P LV

νj →¯νe ,

where we have used that the sum over the three mass
eigenstates is incoherent due to averaging of fast oscilla-
tions. Each of the two terms in (5) are determined in the
next subsections.

A. From r = 0 to r = R⊙

Inside the Sun, the adiabatic evolution of the mass
eigenstate in matter νM
i guarantees that at r = 0 this
state coincides with the mass eigenstate evolved to the
solar surface r = R⊙, where the vacuum mixing is re-
covered νM
i = νi. This leads to the standard conversion

where the mixing matrix is evaluated at r = 0. This is an
approximation; however, an average within the produc-
tion region leaves our results unchanged so it is neglected.
Since V (0) ≪ ∆m2
31/E, the mixing angle θ13 is not en-
hanced by matter eﬀects and we can take θM
13 ≈ θ13 in
the expression above to write the relevant components of
the mixing matrix as

B. From r = R⊙ to r = L

After a neutrino state leaves the Sun,

its evolution
is solely controlled by vacuum oscillations. The full
Hamiltonian can be written as the sum of a conven-
tional Lorentz-invariant part and a small modiﬁcation
introduced by Lorentz violation in the form

H = H0 + δH.

(9)

Each term is a 6 × 6 matrix describing the evolution
of three left-handed neutrinos and three right-handed
antineutrinos. The Lorentz-invariant part has a block-
diagonal form, whereas in δH the Majorana part of the
tensor component appears in the oﬀ-diagonal 3× 3 block.
Since large Lorentz violation remains unobserved, any
deviation from exact Lorentz symmetry is expected to be
small. We use this argument to treat Lorentz violation

perturbatively. For the appropriate implementation of
perturbation theory, the unperturbed Hamiltonian must
be diagonalized ﬁrst. Since the unperturbed Hamilto-
nian corresponds to conventional vacuum oscillations, the
eigenenergies can be written as

E0

k = E0

¯k ≈ |ppp| +

,

m2
k
2|ppp|

(10)

where the index k ∈ {1, 2, 3} denotes neutrino states and
¯k ∈ {¯1, ¯2, ¯3} denotes antineutrino states. The CPT the-
orem implies that the Lorentz-invariant eigenenergies of
H0 are the same for neutrinos and antineutrinos [33]. The
mixing matrix U for the unperturbed system contains the
conventional PMNS matrix U as diagonal blocks

U =(cid:18)U 0

0 U ∗(cid:19) .

(11)

A perturbative series can now be implemented follow-
ing the procedure in Ref. [34]. The time-evolution oper-
ator takes the form

S(t) = e−iHt

= e−iHt eiH0tS(0)(t) = W (t) S(0)(t)
= S(0)(t) + S(1)(t) + S(2)(t) + ··· ,

(12)

where S(n)(t) is the term to order n-th in the perturba-
tion δH and we have used S(0)(t) = e−iH0t. The function
W (t) can be expressed as a Dyson series

W (t) = W (0) + W (1) + W (2) + ···

Using the mixing matrix (11) to relate the mass and ﬂa-

The long propagation distance compared to the rele-
vant oscillation length allows us to simplify some expres-
sions. This occurs due to the decoherence of the neutrino
wave packet, making some oscillatory terms average to
zero. The amplitude S(1)

components are of order O(10−6) or less. Using the CPT
theorem for relating neutrino and antineutrino indices,
the product of the exponential and the functions τ (1)

becomes a simple Kronecker delta δjk. Expression (22)

(25)

This transition probability together with the result in (6)
is what we need to construct the full transition probabil-
ity for νe → ¯νe deﬁned in (5). As mentioned at the end
of Sec. II, the oscillation probability involves a symmet-
ric combination of coeﬃcients, making the antisymmetric
coeﬃcients eH α
¯αβ unobservable in the oscillation channel
νj → ¯νe. For the explicit application of the probabil-
ity (25) we need to specify the reference frame in which
the Hamiltonian δH ¯αβ is expressed. These details are
described in the following section.

IV. REFERENCE FRAME

The appropriate application of the result (25) requires
a choice of reference frame. Even though Lorentz sym-
metry is broken, invariance under coordinate transfor-
mations, also known as observer Lorentz transforma-
tions, remains unchanged [13–15]. This means that any
observer frame is equally valid to express the relevant
Hamiltonian (3). In order to report experimental results
in a meaningful way, which can be used to compare with
other experiments, a convention is required for the frame
of reference in which measurements are made. The stan-
dard frame used is the Sun-centered equatorial frame
In this frame, the ˆX axis points towards the
[36–38].
vernal equinox from the Sun, while the axis of rotation
of the Earth determines the ˆZ axis. The ˆY axis com-
pletes the system as ˆY = ˆZ × ˆX. For experiments with
both source and detector on the surface of the Earth, the
neutrino propagation oscillates with sidereal frequency
ω⊕ ≃ 2π/(23 h 56 m). This oscillation is then used to
decompose the relevant observable in harmonics of the
sidereal phase ω⊕T⊕ [34, 39]. This technique has been
widely used in searches for Lorentz violation in oscillation
experiments [18, 22–29].

In the case of solar neutrinos, only the detector is on
the Earth, while the source is ﬁxed at the origin of the
coordinate system. A diﬀerent approach is then required

4

for an appropriate treatment of the oscillation probabil-
ity. The Sun continuously emits neutrinos in all direc-
tions; however, we are only interested in those neutrinos
emitted in the direction ˆp, deﬁned as the source-detector
orientation. As the Earth moves around the Sun, the
vector ˆp changes with respect to the ﬁxed coeﬃcients for
Lorentz violation, hence a time dependence of the oscil-
lation probability will arise. Instead of sidereal time, a
more reasonable time choice is the use of solar time. The
origin of the time coordinate in the Sun-centered equa-
torial frame is the vernal equinox in the year 2000 [32].
For this reason, time must be measured with respect to
this event that deﬁnes T = 0.

In the Sun-centered equatorial

frame, the source-

detector orientation is given by

ˆp =(cid:0)− cos Ω⊙T,− cos η sin Ω⊙T,− sin η sin Ω⊙T(cid:1), (26)
where Ω⊙ ≃ 2π/(365.25 d) is the annual frequency of
the Earth around the Sun and η ≃ 23.5◦ denotes the
inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the plane
of the celestial equator.
Introducing a spherical basis
with ˆer = ˆp, we can write the two vectors

ˆeθ = (cid:0) sin Ω⊙T,− cos η cos Ω⊙T,− sin η cos Ω⊙T(cid:1),
ˆeφ = (cid:0)0, sin η,− cos η(cid:1),

(27)

to form an orthonormal basis. The helicity vector in (4)
is given by (ǫ+)λ = (0,−~ǫ+) with

~ǫ+ =

1

√2(cid:0)ˆeθ + iˆeφ(cid:1).

(28)

The relevant 4-vectors in expression (4) in the Sun-
centered equatorial frame take the explicit form

(ǫ+)λ =

1

√2(cid:0)0,− sin Ω⊙T, cos η cos Ω⊙T − i sin η,

sin η cos Ω⊙T + i cos η(cid:1),

ˆpσ = (cid:0)1, cos Ω⊙T, cos η sin Ω⊙T, sin η sin Ω⊙T(cid:1). (29)

We can deﬁne the time-dependent functions

fλσ = i√2(ǫ+)∗

λ ˆpσ,

(30)

which take a deﬁnite form for each spacetime component
of the coeﬃcient of interest. The 12 nonvanishing com-

ponents are explicitly given by

fZT = i sin η cos Ω⊙T + cos η,

fXT = −i sin Ω⊙T,

where a = 1.50 × 108 km is the Earth semi-major axis,
e = 0.02 is the eccentricity of the orbit [40], and R⊙ =
6.96 × 105 km is the solar radius. The polar angle θ(T )
is measured from the perihelion, which in the year 2000
occurred on 3 Jan 2000, 5:18 GMT [41]. We can then
write the polar angle as function of time in the form

θ(T ) = θ0 + Ω⊙T,

(34)

where the constant angle θ0 is the diﬀerence between the
perihelion and the vernal equinox of the year 2000. The
vernal equinox occurred on 20 Mar 2000, 7:35 GMT [41],
hence θ0 = Ω⊙∆T , with ∆T = 77.095 d.

V. APPLICATION TO KAMLAND

We can now apply the previous results to experimental
values. The most sensitive limit on νe → ¯νe conversion
was obtained by KamLAND [10], hence we will use this
result to determine limits of the coeﬃcients for CPT vi-
¯ab . The experimental limit on the transition

olation egλσ

probability is [10]

hPνe→¯νeiexp < 5.3 × 10−5

(90% C.L.).

(35)

Notice that the oscillation probability has been averaged
over the energy range 8.3 MeV < E < 31.8 MeV and

5

the analysis includes data accumulated between 5 Mar
2002 and 23 Jul 2010 [10]. Since the exact time of the
day in which the data collection took place is unavail-
able, we will assume that the period began and ended
at local midnight of the corresponding date. Our ﬁnal
results, however, have little dependence on this assump-
tion. With this choice, we will use the local time t given
by a shift on T to compensate for the diﬀerent time zones

T (t) = t − 0.691 d.

(36)

We can now properly average the oscillation probability
(5) over time and energy in the form

E2 = 31.8 MeV. The energy average includes the in-
verse beta decay cross section σ(E) [42] and the energy
spectrum of 8B neutrinos φ(E) [43]. Following the ap-
proach implemented in previous experimental searches
[18, 19, 22–30], we will consider that each individual co-
α ¯β is independently small. This means that for
a given set of spacetime components λσ and ﬂavor indices
α ¯β to be nonzero
at a time. The direct comparison of the averaged proba-
bility (37) with the experimental limit (35) allows us to
determine an upper bound on the magnitude of the cor-
α ¯β. Implementing this procedure,
for the 12 diﬀerent spacetime indices and six ﬂavor com-
binations, 72 independent limits are obtained, where the
mixing angles are taken from current global ﬁts [44, 45].
The new upper limits are presented in Table I, together
with the existing limits for comparison.

The results in Table I show a remarkable improve-
ment on the limits for coeﬃcients for CPT-violation.
The most notorious improvements are on the coeﬃcients
with spacetime components λσ = ZT, ZZ, whose exist-
ing bounds were obtained by searching for spectral dis-
tortions in the Double Chooz data [19]. In this reactor
experiment, antineutrinos only travel about 1 km, which
explains the great improvement by factors 109–1011 when
using solar neutrinos. All the other coeﬃcients produce
sidereal variations, which were studied with data from
MINOS [18]. For these coeﬃcients, the 735-km prop-
agation distance enhances the sensitivity of the experi-
ment by almost three orders of magnitude with respect
to Double Chooz. Moreover, neutrinos in MINOS have a
thousand times more energy than reactor antineutrinos,
α ¯β. Compared to
MINOS, solar neutrinos have only one thousandth of the
energy, but again the Sun-Earth distance compensates

which also increases the sensitivity to egλσ

TABLE I: New upper limits on 72 independent coeﬃcients for CPT-violation within the SME. The ﬂavor indices for each
coeﬃcient take six diﬀerent combinations, and spacetime indices take 12 combinations. Existing limits on these dimensionless
coeﬃcients are also shown for comparison [18, 19].

and the sensitivity of solar neutrinos to these coeﬃcients
is much higher. As shown in Table I, most of the lim-
its on these coeﬃcients are improved by at least three
orders of magnitude. Since the relevant oscillation chan-
nel in MINOS involves νµ and ντ , its sensitivity was low
for coeﬃcients with electron-ﬂavor components. For this
reason, solar neutrinos are up to a factor 105 more sen-
sitive to these coeﬃcients.

VI. SUMMARY

Existing searches for deviations from exact Lorentz
invariance in the neutrino sector have been performed
by diﬀerent collaborations using a variety of accelera-
tor, atmospheric, and reactor experiments [22–30]. Many
of the coeﬃcients controlling the unconventional eﬀects
in these experiments have been constrained. For in-
stance, the sensitivity reach on the dimensionless coef-
ﬁcient for CPT-even Lorentz violation (cL)λσ
αβ span the
10−16–10−27 range, where the high sensitivity end is due
to the high energy and long propagation distance of at-
mospheric neutrinos studied by IceCube [24] and Super-
Kamiokande [30]. These limits could be improved in the

future by systematic studies of the observed ﬂavor ra-
tios of astrophysical neutrinos [46]. Some components of
these coeﬃcients that leave ﬂavor mixing unaﬀected can
also be studied with astrophysical neutrinos [47].

The phenomenon of neutrino-antineutrino mixing has
been explored using reactors and accelerators [18, 19];
nonetheless, the sensitivity of these terrestrial studies is
mostly limited by the neutrino propagation distance. In
the present work, we have taken advantage of the remark-
able propagation distance travelled by neutrinos from the
Sun. Even though the sensitivity to the eﬀects of the co-
eﬃcients for CPT violationegλσ
α ¯β is partially suppressed by
the low energy (∼MeV) of 8B neutrinos, the vast Earth-
Sun separation is millions of times larger than the stan-
dard baseline in laboratory experiments. This advantage
of solar neutrinos allowed us to improve the limits on co-
α ¯β by factors ranging from
about a thousand to 1011. Our results allow pushing
α ¯β to
the 10−26–10−27 range. Unfortunately, the coeﬃcients
α ¯β are unobservable in
the oscillation channel studied in the present work and
the limits on these coeﬃcients remain in the 10−18–10−22
