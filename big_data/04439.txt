Abstract

We introduce a class of uniﬁed supersymmetric axion theories with uniﬁed and PQ sym-
metries broken by the same set of ﬁelds at a scale ∼ 2 × 1016 GeV. A typical domain
wall number of order 30 leads to an axion decay constant fa of order 1015 GeV. Inﬂation
generates a large saxion condensate giving a reheat temperature TR below the QCD scale
for supersymmetry breaking of order 1-10 TeV. Axion ﬁeld oscillations commence in the
saxion matter-dominated era near the QCD scale, and recent lattice computations of the
temperature dependence of the axion mass in this era allow a controlled calculation of the
axion dark matter abundance. A successful prediction of this abundance results for an
initial axion misalignment angle of order unity, θi ∼ 1. A highly correlated set of predic-
tions are discussed for fa, TR, the supersymmetric Higgs mass parameter µ, the amount of
dark radiation ∆Nef f , the proton decay rate Γ(p → e+π0), isocurvature density perturba-
tions and the B-mode of the cosmic microwave background. The last two are particularly
interesting when the energy scale of inﬂation is also of order 1016 GeV.

An elegant solution to the strong CP problem was proposed in 1977 by promoting the strong
CP parameter ¯θ to a ﬁeld [1, 2, 3]. This ﬁeld, the axion a(x), is the pseudo-Goldstone boson
produced by spontaneously breaking a global U(1) symmetry at scale fa. The axion acquires a
mass because this PQ symmetry is explicitly broken by a color anomaly, leading to an interaction
in the low energy eﬀective theory of

where G is the QCD ﬁeld strength. By 1981, constraints from particle physics and astrophysics
already required this scale to be very much larger than the weak scale, fa > 109 GeV [4].
At that time it appeared natural to identify fa as the scale of grand uniﬁcation, either non-
supersymmetric [5] or supersymmetric [6], with the same ﬁeld breaking both the uniﬁed gauge
and PQ symmetries.

However, in 1983 axion production in the early universe by the misalignment mechanism
was discovered, suggesting a limit on fa far below the uniﬁed scale [7, 8, 9]. Requiring that
axions produced from oscillations of the misaligned condensate do not give more dark matter
than observed today yields

eﬀectively decoupling PQ breaking from physics at the uniﬁed scale. For the Pre-Inﬂation
cosmology, where PQ breaking occurs before inﬂation, θi is the initial axion ﬁeld misalignment
√
angle and has a ﬂat prior distribution and so is expected to be order unity, while for the Post-
Inﬂation cosmology θi must be averaged, leading to θeﬀ = π/

3 [10, 11].

The bound Eq. (1.2) applies to the conventional cosmology with an early radiation dominated
universe and can be violated if there is a large entropy release between the GeV and MeV eras
[12]. However, a general bound can still be derived even for this case. An analytic estimate
requiring that axions from the misaligned condensate not give more dark matter than observed
today yields [13]

independent of the particle physics model for the entropy release. TR is the reheat temperature
after this entropy release, and is constrained by the 4He abundance from Big Bang Nucleosyn-
√
thesis (BBN) to be larger than about 3 MeV [14]. Thus, in both the Pre-Inﬂation cosmology
(with θ of order unity) or the Post-Inﬂation cosmology (where θeﬀ = π/
3), a low TR allows fa to
be as large as 1015 GeV, which is still signiﬁcantly below the scale of gauge coupling uniﬁcation
with TeV scale supersymmetry, characterized by the SU (5) gauge boson mass MX (cid:39) 2 × 1016
GeV. From Eqs. (1.3), the physics of PQ breaking apparently lies well below the uniﬁed mass
scale, unless θi (cid:28) 1. While low θi could be understood in a multiverse with an anthropic re-
quirement limiting the dark matter abundance [15], since 1983 there has been little interest in
pursuing grand uniﬁed theories where PQ and uniﬁed gauge symmetries are broken together.

The frequently quoted bound of Eq. (1.2) may not apply in supersymmetric theories. With
low energy supersymmetry the ﬁeld responsible for breaking the PQ symmetry is expected to
release entropy at late time possibly diluting the misalignment axions [16]. There is no need
for introducing separate physics for axion dilution – it can arise from the late decay of a saxion
condensate. However, whether the saxion condensate dilutes axions signiﬁcantly depends on
the corresponding reheat temperature and hence on fa. In any case, the bound of Eq. (1.3) still
applies.

In this paper we study a class of Supersymmetric Grand Uniﬁed Theories where uniﬁed
and PQ symmetries are broken together – SaxiGUTs. We demonstrated that these theories are
realistic and lead to a characteristic set of predictions. The key ingredients of these theories are
• TeV scale supersymmetry with precise gauge coupling uniﬁcation.[17] The scale of the
vacuum expectation value (vev) that breaks SU (5) uniﬁed gauge symmetry is predicted
to be

V5 (cid:39) (1 − 4) × 1016 GeV

(1.4)

depending on threshold corrections and the value of the uniﬁed gauge coupling, g5, with
higher g5 leading to lower V5.

• Simultaneous breaking of SU (5) and PQ symmetries:

VP Q ∼ V5.

(1.5)

Such a large PQ breaking implies a Pre-Inﬂation cosmology. PQ symmetry is broken before
inﬂation and reheating after inﬂation does not restore the PQ symmetry. Hence axion
strings and domain walls are inﬂated away and are not relevant to the observable universe.
The amount of dark matter arising from the misalignment of the axion condensate depends
on the initial misalignment angle θi, which we take order unity.

• A large color anomaly of the PQ symmetry. The scale fa, deﬁned by Eq. (1.1), is deter-

(1.6)

where NDW is the color anomaly of the PQ theory, also known as the domain wall number.
In SaxiGUTs it would require an accident for NDW to be order unity, and instead we ﬁnd
that in typical SaxiGUTs NDW ∼ 10 − 100.

• Doublet-triplet splitting giving a DFSZ-type axion theory. A key issue in uniﬁed theories
is the mass splitting between the light Higgs doublets and their SU (5) partners, which
must be heavy to satisfy the bound from proton decay searches. The two Higgs doublets
lie in multiplets H and ¯H of the uniﬁed theory and a large mass splitting between the
weak doublets and color triplets arises from an interaction between ¯HH and ﬁelds that
break the uniﬁed symmetry. We study the generic case where ¯HH carries a non-zero PQ
charge and hence the axion theory is of DFSZ type [18, 19]. This includes theories where
the doublet-triplet splitting arises via ﬁne-tuning [6] or via vacuum alignment [20].

A large value of NDW resolves an apparent discrepancy: fa ∼ 1015 GeV and V5 (cid:39) (1 − 4) ×

1016 GeV become consistent with VP Q ∼ V5. The relation between V5 and fa is

V5 =

where

c ≡ VP Q

(1.7)

and c is order unity. In Fig. 1 we illustrate this consistency between supersymmetric gauge
coupling uniﬁcation of Eq. (1.4) and values of fa that yield the observed dark matter from
Eq. (1.3) for the two representative values NDW/c = 10, 100.

We present our study as follows. We introduce general SaxiGUT theories, together with
simple examples, in Sec. 2, and in doing so we precisely deﬁne the scale of PQ breaking VP Q,
the scale of gauge coupling uniﬁcation V5 and the domain wall number NDW.
In Sec. 3 we
demonstrate that inﬂation typically generates a saxion condensate of order VP Q or larger. The
misalignment axion DM abundance is independent of the speciﬁc SaxiGUT model and in Sec. 4
we present an eﬀective ﬁeld theory (EFT) for the axion chiral multiplet valid below the PQ
breaking scale. We compute in Sec. 5 the dark matter abundance from axion oscillations initiated
when the saxion condensate dominates the total energy of the universe, making use of recent
lattice results. We emphasize that the observed dark matter abundance calls for supersymmetry
breaking at the TeV scale. The rest of the paper is devoted to additional signals for SaxiGUTs:
dark radiation in Sec. 6, proton decay in Sec. 7, isocurvature perturbations and CMB tensor
modes in Sec. 8. A concise summary of correlated predictions for SaxiGUTs is provided in
Sec. 9.

2 SaxiGUT Theories

We study a class of theories where the grand uniﬁed symmetry G and the PQ symmetry are
broken by the vevs of a set of chiral superﬁelds at the uniﬁed scale. Some of these ﬁelds carry
both G and PQ quantum numbers, while others may be charged under only G or PQ. In this
section we ﬁrst give a precise deﬁnition of the scales of vevs for PQ breaking, VP Q, and gauge
coupling uniﬁcation, V5. Next we give examples of SaxiGUTs and the moduli ﬁeld that results
from breaking PQ symmetry, and ﬁnally we discuss the domain wall number. Throughout the
rest of this paper we adopt the following conventions: we denote superﬁelds and their lowest
components by boldface and regular typeface, respectively. Thus we are interested in theories
of chiral superﬁelds Φi where the lowest components Φi get G and/or PQ breaking vevs vi.

bosons X and Higgs colored triplets. We choose to deﬁne the symmetry breaking scale of gauge

i = (5/6, 4/3)
for i = (24, 75) dimensional representations are close to unity, while ti = 0 if vi preserves SU (5).
Ignoring uniﬁed threshold corrections, gauge coupling uniﬁcation implies MX (cid:39) 2 × 1016 GeV
so that V5 (cid:39) 2 × 1016 GeV/g5. With the minimal matter content of the MSSM below MX
the uniﬁed coupling is predicted to be g5 (cid:39) 0.7; however, with additional matter the uniﬁed
coupling could be larger. With further uncertainty from uniﬁed threshold corrections, we adopt
the range V5 ∼ (1 − 4) × 1016 GeV for precision uniﬁcation.

For low energy physics of the axion supermultiplet the key result is

VP Q = c V5 (cid:39) c (1 − 4) × 1016 GeV.

(2.3)

From Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2), c is typically larger than unity, although it can be less than unity if
some Φi have qi = 0.

We study DFSZ type theories where Matter and Higgs ﬁelds of the low energy theory carry
PQ charges. In particular the MSSM Higgs bilinear H uH d carries non-zero PQ charge, so that
the cosmological saxion condensate decays to Higgs and electroweak gauge bosons, reheating
the visible sector. Hence the µ term is generated from PQ breaking, from operators of the form
[G(Φi)H uH d]θ2 or [XG(Φi, Φ
†
j)H uH d]θ2 ¯θ2, where X is a chiral superﬁeld with a supersymmetry
breaking F component.

2.2 SaxiGUT Models

In principle the PQ symmetry could be an R symmetry, as in the case of both the Nilles-Raby
SU (5) theory [6] and the Hall-Raby SO(10) theory [20]. However, it has been shown quite
generally that in ﬂat space supersymmetric theories with a continuous R symmetry broken at
scale VP Q the vacuum value of the superpotential is bounded by |(cid:104)W(cid:105)| ≤ F VP Q/2 where F is
the scale of supersymmetry breaking [21]. Such values of |(cid:104)W(cid:105)| are insuﬃcient to cancel the
cosmological constant in supergravity unless VP Q is of order the reduced Planck mass. Hence
we restrict our attention to non-R symmetries.

Many SaxiGUTs models can be constructed as follows. Let f (Φ) be a PQ invariant product
of n of the Φi ﬁelds, divided by M n∗ , where M∗ is the UV cutoﬀ of the theory: f = (Π Φ)/M n∗ .
The superpotential takes the form

W = W (f ) + H Φ1(1 + f + ...) H

(2.4)

where H and H contain the Higgs doublets that lead to quark and charged lepton masses,
and Φ1 has opposite PQ charge to that of HH. The superpotential W (f ) leads to a non-zero
vev for f , breaking both PQ and G. This could arise by introducing a singlet ﬁeld Z that
drives the vev via W (f ) = M 2∗ Z(f − 1) or from a superpotential that is a polynomial in f ,
W (f ) = M 3∗ (f + f 2 + ...), where part of moduli space has f determined to a non-zero value.

6

The former case requires f to be invariant under the gauge symmetry G. In the latter case if
f is not gauge invariance certain terms in the polynomial expansions are absent. Here and in
Eqs. (2.4, 2.5) we omit the dimensionless coupling constants. Those in the interaction involving
H and H are ﬁne-tuned to yield a splitting between the doublet and triplet Higgs, leading to a
TeV scale µ parameter. Those in W (f ) must be chosen so that the vacuum value for f is less
than unity, allowing the PQ and gauge symmetries to be broken below the cutoﬀ in the region
of validity of the theory.
Simple SU (5) theories with two Φi ﬁelds include f = Σ(+1)Σ(−1)/M 2∗ , S(+1)Σ(−1)/M 2∗
and f = Σ(+1)2Σ(−2)/M 3∗ where S and Σ are SU (5) singlets and adjoints, respectively, and
the PQ charges are shown in parenthesis. An example with f ∼ (Σ+Σ−) and no driver ﬁeld is

Although the superpotential interactions determine the vev of f , the spontaneous breaking
of the global PQ symmetry, with supersymmetry unbroken, implies a massless chiral superﬁeld,
σ(x), that parameterizes a degenerate moduli space of vacua. This is lifted by the addition of
soft supersymmetry breaking interactions

2 + θ˜a. The saxion
ﬁeld s is deﬁned to be zero at the minimum of the potential and, like the axino ﬁeld ˜a, picks
up a supersymmetry breaking mass, while the axion ﬁeld a acquires mass only from the QCD
anomaly.

This result applies even if G is larger than SU (5), such as SO(10), as long as the G breaking
vevs can be decomposed into SU (5) singlets and adjoints.

2.3 Domain Wall Number

A key aspect of SaxiGUTs is that the domain wall number, NDW, resulting from the ﬁeld
conﬁgurations of the vacuum of Φi is typically large. For a non-R symmetry

NDW = 2

a

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where a runs over all chiral superﬁelds of the theory, including both Φi and the matter and
Higgs of the low energy theory. The PQ charges qa are normalized so that |qi| are all integers
and take the smallest values possible. Ta is the Dynkin index of the color generator for repre-
sentation i with conventional normalization. For SU (5), Ta = 1/2, 3/2, 5, ... for the 5, 10, 24, ...
representations. For SO(10), Ta = 1, 2, 8, 12, ... for the 10, 16, 45, 54... representations. Given
the size of these Dynkin indices, and that |qi| ≥ 1, SaxiGUTs typically have NDW (cid:29) 1, and we
will often consider the range of NDW from 10 to 100.

For the theories described by Eq. (2.4) NDW depends on the nature of the PQ singlet func-
tion f and on the nature of Φ1 appearing in Eq. (2.4).
It can be summarized as NDW =
i qiTi|, where i only runs over all Φi. In two ﬁeld SU (5) examples: f ∼ Σ+Σ− gives
NDW = 2 for both choices of Φ1 = (Σ+, Σ−); f ∼ S Σ gives NDW = (8, 12) for Φ1 = (S, Σ);
and f ∼ Σ2Σ(cid:48) gives NDW = (8, 14) for Φ1 = (Σ, Σ(cid:48)). These theories have only a few small
multiplets breaking the uniﬁed symmetry. Larger uniﬁed theories will have larger NDW; for
example the Hall-Raby SO(10) theory has NDW = 94.

Initial Conditions from Inﬂation

The abundance of axion dark matter is greatly aﬀected by the decay of the saxion condensate,
so it is important to study the size of this condensate, which originates from standard inﬂation.
SaxiGUTs have a large domain wall number as discussed in Sec. 2. We avoid the axion domain
wall and GUT monopole problems by assuming that the PQ and G breaking vevs of Φi are
non-zero during inﬂation so that these defects are inﬂated away. Hence, both during and after
inﬂation we must work in the broken phase where, in the supersymmetric limit, the potential
involves a complex ﬂat direction, σ(x), corresponding to the axion and saxion ﬁeld modes.
Expanding about any point along this ﬂat direction the other modes have masses of order the

8

uniﬁed scale (ignoring the possibility of further moduli). Hence any initial values for these other
modes will rapidly disappear due to damped oscillations in the expanding early universe.

In this section we ﬁnd inﬂation leads to three behaviors for the initial value of the condensate

σi (deﬁned with σ = 0 today)

1. σi ∼ VP Q, where VP Q is the P Q breaking scale today, as deﬁned in the previous section

(with VP Q ∼ V5 ∼ 2 × 1016 GeV).

2. σi ∼ M∗, where M∗ is the UV cutoﬀ of the SaxiGUT ﬁeld theory.
3. σi = 0.

The third case results only in certain special situations, and is not of interest for SaxiGUTs.
The axion dark matter abundance resulting from the ﬁrst two cases is computed in Sec. 5 and
is found to be independent of σi over the entire relevant region of parameter space. In Sec. 8 we
show that the second case allows EI ∼ 1016 GeV, so that tensor modes of the cosmic microwave
background may be discovered at next generation experiments.
The potential for σ requires supersymmetry breaking, and during inﬂation supersymmetry
was broken by the physics that generated the inﬂaton potential ρI ∼ E4
I [22]. This physics
communicates with the grand uniﬁed sector via higher dimension operators suppressed by the
cutoﬀ scale of the theory, M∗ > VP Q, so that during inﬂation σ feels a supersymmetry breaking
potential

dominates that from the usual soft supersymmetry breaking interactions, ˜m ∼ TeV.

i describe interactions between inﬂation and uniﬁed sectors and are order
I /M∗ and for EI > 1010 GeV this scale

For cI

i > 0, only the leading term in 1/M 2∗ in Eq. (3.1) is needed to determine σ and the
resulting potential leads to a minimum for the real component of σ which acquires a mass of
I /M∗. For any cutoﬀ M∗ less than the reduced Planck scale MP l = 2.4 × 1018 GeV,
order of E2
the saxion ﬁeld will undergo oscillations during inﬂation, since msI > 3HI, and will settle to the
minimum of this potential. Thus inﬂation determines an initial value for the saxion ﬁeld.

In the SaxiGUT models discussed in Sec. 2, the superpotential constrains a product of n
i of order unity, at the

ﬁelds, called f (φi), to some value M n, with M of order VP Q. With cI
minimum φi = vI

i take values of order M . For example, in the case of f ∼ Φ+Φ−

where xI is the same function of cI± as x is of c±. For generic order unity parameters (cI±, c±),
σi ∼ VP Q so that theories with cI± > 0 are of the ﬁrst type listed above.

σi = (xI − x) qM

9

In certain theories moduli space may have special symmetry points. If the interactions lead-
ing to the symmetry breaking potentials respect these discrete symmetries, then the constants ci
i may be equal to the symmetry point values. With f ∼ Φ+Φ−, imposing a Z2 symmetry
and cI
Φ+ ↔ Φ− leads to c+ = c− and cI
+ = cI−. Under these circumstances the minimum of the
potential is at the symmetry point both during and after inﬂation so that xI = x and there is
no condensate σi = 0, giving the third case listed above.

If one or more of cI

i are negative, the quadratic term of Eq. (3.1) leads to ﬁeld values much
greater than VP Q. Positive higher order terms are required to stop runaway behavior, and in
this case the generic expectation is that σi ∼ M∗, the second case listed above.
The role of inﬂation in the above discussion is to determine σi. However, even if EI (cid:28) 1010
GeV, so the inﬂationary era does not determine σi, there is no reason why this initial value
should be within VP Q of the minimum determined by Eq. (2.6).

4 The Eﬀective Theory Below The Uniﬁed Scale

To describe axion and saxion physics below the PQ breaking scale, we take a model-independent
approach and write down an EFT. This is suﬃcient for the computation in the next section of
the axion dark matter abundance, which is therefore independent of many model-dependent
features of SaxiGUTs. Since VP Q is much larger than the SUSY breaking scale, we construct a
supersymmetric EFT where the PQ symmetry is non-linearly realized [23, 24]. In this section
we write down such an EFT and give the partial widths for saxion decays. Details about the
EFT and calculations can be found in Appendix A.

Our conceptual starting point is a UV complete theory where the PQ symmetry is broken
by the vevs vi of chiral superﬁelds Φi. We assign to Φi a PQ charge qi, such that a PQ rotation
with angle α in the UV theory induces

At energies below the PQ breaking scale we have a massless Goldstone superﬁeld

The diﬀerent components of A are massless, since the axion a mass is protected by being a
Goldstone bosons and the degeneracy in the multiplet is ensured by SUSY. The breaking of
SUSY will provide masses for the saxion s and the axino1 ˜a, but not for the axion.
In the
low-energy EFT the PQ symmetry is non-linearly realized

their cosmic density could be depleted by a dilution mechanism analogous to the one discussed in this work [26].

5 Axion Dark Matter and Dilution from Saxions

In SaxiGUT theories the uniﬁed and PQ symmetries are broken before inﬂation. In the absence
of supersymmetry breaking there is a complex ﬂat direction corresponding to the axion and

11

saxion modes. During inﬂation the vacuum energy of the inﬂaton ﬁeld breaks supersymmetry,
generating a potential for the saxion ﬁeld. In Sec. 3 we argue that this generically leads to an
initial displacement of the saxion ﬁeld around today’s minimum of σi ∼ VP Q. This condensate
decays at a rate given by Eq. (4.9) and, given the large value of VP Q, the decays occur after
the QCD phase transition, diluting the axion density. This invalidates the usual cosmological
bound on fa of Eq. (1.2) and in this section we compute the axion dark matter abundance in
SaxiGUTs. We begin by summarizing the relevant cosmological evolution, illustrated in Fig. 2.
After inﬂation the saxion ﬁeld remains ﬁxed at σi due to Hubble friction until the Hubble
parameter drops to 3H ∼ ms when it starts to oscillate at temperature

where g∗(T ) is the eﬀective number of degrees of freedom in the thermal bath at temperature
T . This happens during an early Radiation Dominated era (RD(cid:48)). Once the saxion ﬁeld starts
oscillating, its energy density red-shifts as non-relativistic matter and thus decreases as a−3,
where a is the scale factor of the FRW metric. It eventually dominates over radiation, and the
universe enters an early matter-dominated (MD) era at temperature TM where the saxion and
radiation energy densities are equal

This MD era consists of two phases – adiabatic (MDA) and non-adiabatic (MDN A), as detailed
in Ref.
[26]. During the MDA phase, the radiation energy density is dominated by the red-
shifted initial radiation, with the saxion decay products providing a sub-dominant contribution.
However, the relativistic decay products of the saxion eventually become the dominant form of
radiation at temperature

where D denotes the number of ﬁnal states kinematically accessible in saxion decay and in the

key role in our analysis of the cosmological axion abundance and its dependence on µ, as well
as other dimensionless parameters, is shown in the right panel of Fig. 3. It is remarkable that
the relevant range of TR that leads to the observed dark matter results for µ of order (1 − 10)
TeV. After saxion decay, the Universe returns to a Radiation Dominated era (RD). The saxion
cosmology described in this section is summarized in Fig. 2.

5.1 Analytic Results

The cosmological axion abundance depends sensitively on the turn-on of axion ﬁeld oscillations.
In SaxiGUTs this occurs during the saxion MD era at a lower temperature than in the usual
RD case. We assume the temperature dependance of the axion mass takes the form

where Λ is the QCD phase transition scale. A lattice calculation in the quenched approximation
gives 2n (cid:39) 6.8 [27], in good agreement with the dilute instanton gas approximation. However,
including light dynamical quarks leads to a much lower value, 2n = 2.7 [28]. We show results
for both results and take Λ = 150 MeV. These lattice results have a limited domain of validity
in temperature, but are suﬃcient for axion oscillations in the MD era.

We calculate the axion abundance from the misalignment mechanism and saxion dilution
following Ref. [13]. The calculation is simpliﬁed by employing the adiabatic condition that,
despite the varying axion mass, the number densities of both the axion and saxion scale the
same way as a−3 after the axion starts to oscillate at temperature T (a)

starts to oscillate during the MDN A era. Fig. 3 also shows that T (a)

validity of the lattice results of [27] and [28].

5.2 Numerical Analysis and Results

We begin by giving the equations for the evolution of the cosmological background, of radiation
and matter, during the epoch where axion ﬁeld oscillations turn on and undergo dilution. We
include the temperature dependence of g∗(T ) which is strong near the QCD phase transition.

irrelevant [26]. Furthermore, Eq. (5.3) implies that the saxion initial oscillation amplitude σi
does not aﬀect the axion oscillation either. As a result, in this calculation, the free parameters
are TR, fa, and, θi. Requiring the axion abundance to be equal to the observed dark matter

determines the misalignment angle for each given (TR, fa), giving the contour plot of Fig. 4. For
θi of order unity, fa can be as high as 2 × 1015 GeV without upsetting the BBN bound, which
then allows VP Q to be as high as the GUT scale with NDW ∼ 10.
Since PQ breaking occurs before inﬂation, the initial axion ﬁeld misalignment angle θi has
a ﬂat prior distribution between −π and π. As a result, the probability of having |θi| ≤ xπ (for
0 ≤ x ≤ 1) is x; in other words, the medium value of θi is π/2. In particular, the range of θi

corresponds to 1σ deviation around the medium value, covering 58% probability. Using this
range, and trading TR for µ(µ/ms)1/3 using Eq. (5.5) for speciﬁed qµ/c, we can turn our results
into a prediction for Ωah2 as a function of µ(µ/ms)1/3 for VP Q = cV5, as shown in Fig. 5. Hence
µ is expected to be of order (1 − 10) TeV unless θi is ﬁne-tuned. The lower panels show that
larger values of qµ/c allow µ less than 1 TeV. It is important to note that this prediction is
insensitive to the µ/ms ratio, due to its appearance as the 1/3 power.

gauge bosons, that are tightly constrained in SaxiGUTs and ignore dimension-ﬁve operators
mediated by Higgs triplet exchange, which are highly model-dependent. The inverse decay rate

Isocurvature Perturbations and CMB Tensor Modes

Here we investigate whether the energy scale of inﬂation, EI = ρ1/4
, could also be of this size so
that uniﬁed, axion and inﬂation physics all occur at the same scale. This is further motivated
by the observation that if the observed tilt, ns − 1, in the scalar density perturbations, As, has
a signiﬁcant contribution from the slow roll parameter , requiring  ∼ 10−2, then consistency
with the magnitude of As leads to EI ∼ 2 × 1016 GeV.

prospect of discovering B-modes in the microwave background. Furthermore, the resulting low
value of  may require a high degree of tuning in the inﬂaton potential.

In SaxiGUTs two eﬀects allow much larger values of EI to be consistent with Piso. First,
dilution of the axion abundance by saxion decays allows θi of order unity for large values of fa of

9 A Summary of Predictions

We have introduced a class of supersymmetric grand uniﬁed theories having PQ symmetry
broken at VP Q = cV5, where V5 is the SU (5) breaking scale of gauge coupling uniﬁcation and c
is order unity. The PQ phase transition occurs before inﬂation, which sets the saxion ﬁeld to
a value generically of order VP Q or larger relative to its present value. This leads to an era of
saxion oscillations with a reheat temperature of order 10 MeV, implying that axion oscillations
from misalignment occur in a matter-dominated era and are signiﬁcantly diluted. SaxiGUTs
predict the observed dark matter abundance for a supersymmetry breaking scale of order 1-10
TeV and a domain wall number NDW ∼ 10 − 100, typical for such uniﬁed theories. These and
other predictions are summarized below.

• A low reheat temperature. The decay of the saxion condensate via interactions proportional

to the µ term, which has non-zero PQ charge qµ, leads to a reheat temperature

• High fa. The axion dark matter abundance is closely related to fa, as shown in Eq. (5.10),
as fa determines the present value of the axion mass. The resulting prediction for fa is
shown in Fig. 4. For θi (cid:39) 1, fa varies in the interval (0.2 − 2) × 1015 GeV as TR decreases
from 100 MeV to 3 MeV. However, consistency with VP Q ∼ V5 favors low TR, and for
NDW /c < 50 we ﬁnd the 1σ range of θi gives fa in the range (0.4− 3)× 1015 GeV. Smaller
θi allows larger fa: θi = 0.1 allows fa as large as 1016 GeV.
Axion dark matter leads to oscillating nuclear electric dipole moments that could be de-
tected via nuclear spin precession [35]. With established techniques, phase 2 of the pro-
posed CASPEr experiment could probe fa
to SaxiGUTs could be tested in further experiments if technical challenges can be over-
come [35]. A new detection method was proposed in Ref. [36] by exploiting the axion
response in a static magnetic ﬁeld. This new idea probes the axion coupling to photons,
>∼ 1013 GeV. Black hole superradiance already suggests a
and the estimated reach is fa
<∼ 2× 1017 GeV [37, 38] and, with the discovery of gravitational waves from collid-
limit fa
ing black holes, the prospect of searching for signals at lower fa is exciting. For black hole
masses of 2M(cid:12), Advanced Ligo could probe down to fa of around 2 × 1016 GeV [37, 38]
and, if black holes of mass M(cid:12)/3 are produced, future gravity wave detectors could probe
fa as low as 3 × 1015 GeV.

saxion decay, leads to a prediction for the amount of axion dark matter

For θi, qµ and c of order unity, this is consistent with providing the entire observed dark
matter abundance for µ ∼ 1 − 10 TeV and NDW ∼ 10 − 100. The numerical result for
Ωah2 is shown over the parameter space in Fig. 5.

• TeV-scale supersymmetry. Supersymmetry breaking is connected via electroweak symme-

try breaking to µ, which is predicted from Eq. (9.2) and has leading scaling behavior

The power law dependence of Eq. (9.2) on µ provides a more powerful constraint on
raising the supersymmetry breaking scale than is provided by logarithmic gauge coupling
uniﬁcation. A large misalignment angle in a simple SaxiGUT with low NDW may lead to
signals at Run-2 of LHC. As µ is lowered, consistency of Eq. (9.1) with BBN requires a
raising qµ/cV5.

• Dark Radiation. Saxion decay to axions leads to a contribution to dark radiation that
depends on κ/qµ, where κ is deﬁned in Eq. (4.6). The constraint from Planck of ∆Nef f <
0.1 is shown in Fig. 6 together with the parameter space that will be probed by future

23

experiments reaching ∆Nef f < 0.02. The region that can be probed is not large; however,
it corresponds to the lowest values of µ currently allowed (for any ﬁxed values of the other
parameters).

• Proton Decay. The prediction for Γ−1(p → e+π0) from X gauge boson exchange as a
function of TR is shown in Fig. 7 for the 1σ range of θi and αG = 1/25. This prediction is
obtained by normalizing MX to the observed abundance of dark matter, not from gauge
coupling uniﬁcation. The only other parameter relevant for this prediction is NDW /c. For
NDW /c < 10 and the 1σ range of θi, consistency between the dark matter abundance and
<∼ 10 MeV, and Fig. 7 shows that such parameters
gauge coupling uniﬁcation requires TR
will give a signal in the next generation of experiments searching for proton decay.

• Cosmic Microwave Background. SaxiGUTs with a large saxion condensate during inﬂa-
tion, σi ∼ 1018−19 GeV, allow an energy scale of the vacuum energy during inﬂation is of
EI ∼ 1016 GeV, close to the symmetry breaking scales V5 and VP Q. Future experiments
may then discover both isocurvature density perturbations that arose during inﬂation from
quantum ﬂuctuations in the axion ﬁeld, as in Eq. (8.1), and B-mode polarization of the
CMB radiation, as in Eq. (8.4).

These diverse phenomena are correlated because SaxiGUTs provides a uniﬁed framework for

dark matter, the strong CP problem, the TeV scale, gauge uniﬁcation and inﬂation.

A Axion Supermultiplet Interactions and Saxion Decays

In this Appendix we give details about the EFT introduced in Sec. 4. We give the EFT La-
grangian and then we use these interactions to compute the saxion decay widths given in the
main text of this work. The interactions of the axion supermultiplet described by Eq. (4.2) of
Sec. 4 must respect the shift symmetry described by Eq. (4.3). We divide the interactions into
three categories: K¨ahler potential, superpotential and SUSY breaking.
We work in the basis where the ﬁelds Φi are canonically normalized

The ﬁrst equality does not contain any approximation, and we observe that the K¨ahler potential
depends only on the combination A+A†, consistently with the shift symmetry in Eq. (4.3). The
second equality involves the Taylor expansion up to cubic terms. The quadratic piece ensures
that the axion superﬁeld is canonically normalized. The cubic terms gives the interaction in
Eq. (4.5) responsible for the saxion decay to two axions with decay width as in Eq. (4.7).
Superpotential interactions for the axion superﬁeld alone are forbidden. Holomorphy imposes
that we can only have functions of A and not A†, which are not PQ invariant. However, we are
interested in DFSZ theories where the combination H uH d is PQ charged and therefore a µ is
obtained only through PQ breaking. Deﬁning qµ as the PQ charge of the µ term, we have the
superpotential interaction

Finally, a soft SUSY breaking Bµ term must be present in our theory in order to break the
electroweak symmetry. Moreover, this scalar potential term alone also violates PQ. We introduce
the SUSY breaking spurion superﬁeld X = θ2Bµ, and we write down the PQ invariant and
SUSY breaking interaction

can be compactly expressed in terms of the mass eigenstates

To summarize, saxion decay rates to visible matter are quantiﬁed by Eqs. (A.14), (A.15)
and (A.16). These expressions are completely general and they only assume the validity of the
decoupling limit regime mA (cid:29) mZ. The total width for visible channels depend on the saxion
mass with respect to mA, which determines how many channels are kinematically available. For
saxion mass values such that only SM ﬁnal states are possible we have the saxion visible width
