ABSTRACT

On November 12, 2014, the ESA/Rosetta descent module Philae landed on the Abydos site of
comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Aboard this module, the Ptolemy mass spectrometer measured
a CO/CO2 ratio of 0.07 ± 0.04 which diﬀers substantially from the value obtained in the coma by
the Rosetta/ROSINA instrument, suggesting a heterogeneity in the comet nucleus. To understand
this diﬀerence, we investigated the physico-chemical properties of the Abydos subsurface leading to
CO/CO2 ratios close to that observed by Ptolemy at the surface of this region. We used a comet
nucleus model that takes into account diﬀerent water ice phase changes (amorphous ice, crystalline
ice and clathrates), as well as diﬀusion of molecules throughout the pores of the matrix. The input
parameters of the model were optimized for the Abydos site and the ROSINA CO/CO2 measured ratio
is assumed to correspond to the bulk value in the nucleus. We ﬁnd that all considered structures of
water ice are able to reproduce the Ptolemy observation with a time diﬀerence not exceeding ∼50 days,
i.e. lower than ∼2% on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko’s orbital period. The suspected heterogeneity
of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko’s nucleus is also found possible only if it is constituted of crystalline
ices. If the icy phase is made of amorphous ice or clathrates, the diﬀerence between Ptolemy and
ROSINA’s measurements would rather originate from the spatial variations in illumination on the
nucleus surface. An eventual new measurement of the CO/CO2 ratio at Abydos by Ptolemy could be
decisive to distinguish between the three water ice structures.

INTRODUCTION

On November 12, 2014, the ESA/Rosetta descent mod-
ule Philae landed at the Abydos site on the surface of
comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (hereafter 67P/C-
G). As part of the scientiﬁc payload aboard Philae, the
Ptolemy mass spectrometer (Wright et al. 2007) per-
formed the analysis of several samples from the surface
at Agilkia (Wright et al. 2015) and atmosphere at Aby-
dos (Morse et al. 2015). The main molecules detected
by Ptolemy on the Abydos site were H2O, CO and CO2,
with a measured CO/CO2 molar ratio of 0.07 ± 0.04.
Meanwhile, the CO/CO2 ratio has also been sampled in
67P/C-G’s coma between August and September 2014
by the ROSINA Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer
(DFMS; Balsiger et al. 2007; H¨assig et al. 2013) aboard
the Rosetta spacecraft. Strong variations of the CO and
CO2 production rates, dominated by the diurnal changes
on the comet, have been measured by ROSINA, giv-
ing CO/CO2 ratios ranging between 0.50 ± 0.18 and
1.62 ± 1.34 over the August-September 2014 time pe-
riod (H¨assig et al. 2015). Large ﬂuctuations correlated
with the sampled latitudes have also been observed and

explained either by seasonal variations or by a com-
positional heterogeneity in the nucleus (H¨assig et al.
2015). Further investigation of the coma heterogeneity
performed by Luspay-Kuti et al.
(2015) in the south-
ern hemisphere of 67P/C-G at a later time period led
to conclusions in favor of compositional heterogeneity.
This latter hypothesis is also reinforced by the Ptolemy
measurement of the CO/CO2 ratio at the Abydos site,
which is found outside the range covered by the ROSINA
measurements (Morse et al. 2015).

Here, we aim at investigating the physico-chemical
properties of the Abydos subsurface which can repro-
duce the CO/CO2 ratio observed by Ptolemy, assum-
ing that the composition of the solid phase located be-
neath the landing site initially corresponds to the value
in the coma. To investigate the possibility of a heteroge-
neous nucleus for 67P/C-G, we have employed a comet
nucleus model with i) an updated set of thermodynamic
parameters relevant for this comet and ii) an appropriate
parameterization of the illumination at the Abydos site.
This allows us to mimic the thermal evolution of the sub-
surface of this location. By searching for the matching
conditions between the properties of the Abydos subsur-
face and the Ptolemy data, we provide several constraints
on the structural properties and composition of Philae’s
landing site in diﬀerent cases.

2. THE COMET NUCLEUS MODEL

The one-dimensional comet nucleus model used in this
work is described in Marboeuf et al. (2012). This model
considers an initially homogeneous sphere composed of a
predeﬁned porous mixture of ices and dust in speciﬁed
proportions.
It describes heat transmission, gas diﬀu-

sion, sublimation/recondensation of volatiles within the
nucleus, water ice phase transition, dust release, and dust
mantle formation. The model takes into account diﬀer-
ent phase changes of water ice, within: amorphous ice,
crystalline ice and clathrates. The use of a 1D model is
a good approximation for the study of a speciﬁc point at
the surface of the comet nucleus, here the Abydos land-
ing site. However, since 67P/C-G’s shape is far from
being a sphere (Sierks et al. 2015), we have param-
eterized the model in a way that correctly reproduces
the illumination conditions at Abydos. This has been
made possible via the use of the 3D shape model de-
veloped by Jorda et al. (2014) which gives the coordi-
nates of Abydos on the surface of 67P/C-G’s nucleus,
as well as the radius corresponding to the Abydos land-
ing site and the normal to the surface at this speciﬁc
location. The Abydos landing site is located just out-
side the Hatmethit depression, at the very edge of the
area illuminated during the mapping and close obser-
vation phases of the Rosetta mission, roughly until De-
cember 2014.
It is also at the edge of a relatively ﬂat
region of the small lobe illuminated throughout the per-
ihelion passage of the comet. Geomorphologically, Aby-
dos is interpreted as being a rough deposit region com-
posed of meter-size boulders (Lucchetti et al. 2016).
Other geometric parameters speciﬁc to 67P/C-G, such
as the obliquity and the argument of the subsolar merid-
ian at perihelion, are calculated from the orientation of
the spin axis computed during the shape reconstruction
process (Jorda et al. 2014). Table 1 summarizes the
main parameters used in this work. The porosity and
dust/ice ratio of the cometary material are set in the
range of measurement of 80 ± 5 % (Kofman et al. 2015)
and 4 ± 2 (Rotundi et al. 2014), respectively. These
two parameters are linked through the density of the
cometary material, and are set to be compatible with
the preliminary value determined by Jorda et al. (2014)
(510 ± 20 kg/m3). 67P/C-G’s thermal inertia is esti-
mated to be in the 10–150 W K−1 m−2 s1/2 range based
on the measurement obtained by the Rosetta/VIRTIS
instrument (Leyrat et al.
2015). According to the
same study, regions surrounding Abydos are character-
ized by a thermal inertia in the lower half of this range.
We have therefore chosen a low thermal inertia close to
50 W K−1 m−2 s1/2.

In addition to water ice and dust, the solid phase of
our model includes CO and CO2 volatiles. Although
coma abundances do not necessarily reﬂect those in the
nucleus, they constitute the most relevant constraint
available on its composition. We thus considered the
CO/CO2 ratio (1.62 ± 1.34) measured by ROSINA on
August 7, 2014 at 18 hours, as representative of the bulk
ice composition in the nucleus, and more speciﬁcally in
the Abydos subsurface. This ratio is derived from the
CO/H2O and CO2/H2O ROSINA measurements per-
formed at this date, which are equal to 0.13 ± 0.07 and
0.08 ± 0.05, respectively (H¨assig et al. 2015). We se-
lected the date of August 7 because i) the corresponding
ROSINA measurements were performed at high north-
ern latitudes where the Abydos site is located, and ii)
the large CO/CO2 range obtained at this moment cov-
ers all values measured by ROSINA at other dates (in-
cluding the late value obtained by Le Roy et al. (2015)

CO/CO2 = 1.08).

The three main phases of ices identiﬁed in the litera-
ture, namely crystalline ice, amorphous ice and clathrate
phase, are considered in this work. Outgassing of
volatiles in 67P/C-G could then result from the subli-
mation of ices, amorphous-to-crystalline ice phase tran-
sition, or destabilization of clathrates in the crystalline
ice, amorphous ice and clathrates cases, respectively. Be-
cause the properties of volatiles trapping in the nucleus
matrix strongly depend on the considered icy phase, the
following models have been considered:

Crystalline ice model — Water ice is fully crystalline,
meaning that no volatile species are trapped in the water
ice structure. Here, CO and CO2 are condensed in the
pores of the matrix made of water ice and dust;

Amorphous ice model — The matrix itself is made of
amorphous water ice with a volatile trapping eﬃciency
not exceeding ∼10%. In this case, the cumulated mole
fraction of volatiles is higher than this value, implying
that an extra amount of volatiles is crystallized in the
pores. With this in mind, we consider diﬀerent distribu-
tions of CO and CO2 in the both phases of this model;

Clathrate model — Water ice is exclusively used to form
clathrates. Similarly to amorphous ice, clathrates have a
maximum trapping capacity (∼17%). The extra amount
of volatiles, if any, also crystallizes in the pores. In our
case, however, CO is fully trapped in clathrates and es-
capes only when water ice sublimates. In contrast, we
assume that solid CO2 exists in the form of crystalline
CO2 in the pores of the nucleus because this molecule
is expected to condense in this form in the protosolar
nebula (Mousis et al. 2008).

3. THERMAL EVOLUTION OF THE SUBSURFACE AT

ABYDOS

Our results show that the illumination at the surface of
the Abydos site is a critical parameter for the evolution
of the nucleus, regardless the considered ice structure.
Consequently, all three models described in Section 2
present the same behavior up to a given point. We ﬁrst
describe the characteristics displayed in common by the
three models by presenting the thermal evolution of the

crystalline ice model, before discussing the variations re-
sulting from the diﬀerent assumptions on the nature of
ices. Figure 1 shows the time evolution of the nucleus
stratigraphy, which corresponds to the structural diﬀer-
entiation occurring in the subsurface of the Abydos site.
This diﬀerentiation results from the sublimation of the
diﬀerent ices. After each perihelion passage, the sub-
limation interfaces of CO and CO2 reach deeper layers
beneath the nucleus surface, with a progression of ∼20
m per orbit. The CO sublimation interface always prop-
agates deeper than its CO2 counterpart because of the
higher volatility of the former molecule. On the other
hand, because surface ablation is signiﬁcant, the progres-
sion of these interfaces is stopped by the propagation of
the water sublimation front after perihelion. This allows
the Abydos region to present a “fresh” surface after each
perihelion.

result from temperature variations induced by diurnal
variations of the insolation.

We deﬁne ∆t as the time diﬀerence existing between
the Ptolemy CO/CO2 observations (here 0.07 measured
on November 12, 2014) and the epoch at which our model
reproduces these data (see Figure 2). In each case inves-
tigated, we vary the input parameters of the model to
minimize the value of ∆t (see Table 2 for details). We
have also deﬁned the quantity ft = ∆t/Porb, namely the
fraction of 67P/C-G’s orbital period (Porb = 6.44 yr)
corresponding to ∆t. The results of our simulations are
indicated below.

Fig. 1.— Stratigraphy of the Abydos subsurface represented dur-
ing 35 years of evolution (∼5 orbits of 67P/C-G), showing the in-
terfaces of sublimation of considered volatile species. The surface
ablation occurs at each perihelion (represented by the vertical lines)
and reaches all interfaces.

At the surface of the Abydos site, the outgassing rates
of CO and CO2 vary with the illumination conditions,
reaching maxima at perihelion and minima at aphelion.
Because the sublimation interface of CO2 is closer to the
surface, its production rate is more sensitive to the illumi-
nation conditions than that of CO. As a result, the out-
gassing rate of CO2 presents important variations with
illumination while that of CO is less aﬀected. This dif-
ference strongly impacts the evolution of the CO/CO2
outgassing ratio at the surface of Abydos (see Figure 2).
Close to perihelion, this ratio crosses the range of values
measured by Ptolemy (0.07 ± 0.04) and reaches a mini-
mum. Note that the CO/CO2 outgassing ratio presents
spikes during a certain period after perihelion. These
spikes appear when the CO and CO2 interfaces of sub-
limation are dragged out to the surface by ablation and

the 0.12–1.35 W m−1 K−1 range (Klinger 1980), the con-
ductivity of amorphous water ice lays under those of dust
(4 W m−1 K−1) and crystalline ices (3–20 W m−1 K−1).
Since amorphous ice dominates the volatile phase, the
mean conductivity is never too far from to that of dust,
irrespective of the dust/ice ratio considered within the
observed range.

Clathrate model — In this case, low CO/CO2 ratios (still
within the range given in Table 1) are required to get val-
ues of ∆t below 50 days (i.e., ft below 2%). Similarly to
the case of the amorphous ice model, ∆t is poorly sensi-
tive to the variation of the dust/ice ratio because the con-
ductivity of clathrates (0.5 W m−1 K−1; Krivchikov et al.
2005a, 2005b) is small compared to that of dust.

4. DISCUSSION

Our goal was to investigate the possibility of recovering
the value of the CO/CO2 outgassing ratio measured by
the Ptolemy instrument at the surface of Abydos. Inter-
estingly, all considered models match the Ptolemy value
with ft lower than ∼2%, provided that an optimized set
of parameters is adopted for the Abydos region. Despite
the fact it is poorly sensitive to the adopted dust/ice ra-
tio, a nucleus model dominated by amorphous ice (and
possibly including a smaller fraction of crystalline ices)
gives the best results (∆t ≤ 4 days, i.e. ft ≤ 0.2%) for
a primordial CO/CO2 ratio equal to the central value
measured by the ROSINA instrument. On the other
hand, the crystalline ice and clathrate models require
a primordial CO/CO2 ratio close to the lower limit sam-
pled by ROSINA to obtain values of ∆t under 50 days
(i.e. ft under 2%). We stress the fact that the CO/CO2
range of validity is used under the assumption that the
ROSINA measurements correspond to the bulk nucleus
abundances, which is not necessarily true. A second re-
quirement to minimize the value of ∆t in the crystalline
ice model is the necessity to adopt a dust/ice ratio at
least equal to or higher than the upper limit determined
by Rotundi et al.
(2014) for 67P/C-G. This is sup-
ported by the pictures taken at Abydos by the CIVA
instrument (Bibring et al. 2007) aboard the Philae mod-
ule. The very low reﬂectance of 3–5% of the Abydos
region (Bibring et al. 2015) is in agreement with the
OSIRIS and VIRTIS reﬂectance measurements in the vis-
ible (Sierks et al. 2015) and near-IR (Capaccioni et al.
2015), which are consistent with a low ice content in the
upper surface layer (Capaccioni et al. 2015).

Surface illumination can also greatly inﬂuence the
CO/CO2 outgassing ratio on 67P/C-G. To quantify this
eﬀect, we have simulated a point of 67P/C-G’s nucleus
which is more illuminated in comparison to Abydos. We
have performed a set of simulations at a co-latitude of
-52.25◦, a point that receives permanent sunlight around
perihelion. At the date when the CO/CO2 outgassing
ratio at Abydos is equal to 0.07 (the central value of
Ptolemy’s range of measurement), we obtain a diﬀerent
value for the CO/CO2 outgassing ratio at this new lo-
cation, irrespective of the adopted model. For the crys-
talline ice model, the outgassing ratio at the illuminated
site reaches a value of 0.11, which is still within Ptolemy’s
range of measurement. This implies that a diﬀerent
illumination cannot explain a strong variation of the
CO/CO2 outgassing ratio if the nucleus presents a ho-

the nucleus have a strong inﬂuence on ∆t. This quan-
tity is minimized i) when the adopted dust/ice ratio be-
comes higher than those found by Rotundi et al. (2014)
and ii) if the selected initial CO/CO2 ratio is lower
than the nominal value found by ROSINA (H¨assig et al.
2015). Figure 3 shows the evolution of ∆t as a func-
tion of the dust/ice ratio for two diﬀerent values of the
initial CO/CO2 ratio, namely 1.62 (the central value)
and 0.46 (close to the lower limit). These results con-
ﬁrm the aforementioned trend: with CO/CO2 = 0.46
and a dust/ice ratio of 6 or higher, the Ptolemy’s mea-
surement epoch is matched with ∆t = 52 ± 27 days or
lower, which corresponds to ft lower than ∼2%. These
results can be explained by the thermal conductivity of
crystalline water ice, which is in the 3–20 W m−1 K−1
range (Klinger 1980), considering the temperatures in the
comet. Because dust has a conductivity of 4 W m−1 K−1
(Ellsworth & Schubert 1983), the global conductivity de-
creases with the increase of the dust/ice ratio in the nu-
cleus. Since heating in the nucleus is mostly provided
by surface illumination, a low conductivity increases the
temperature gradient between the upper and deeper lay-
ers (where the CO2 and the CO sublimation interfaces
are located, respectively). This gradient enhances more
the sublimation rate of CO2 ice than that of CO ice, lead-
ing to smaller CO/CO2 outgassing ratios at the surface
and to a smaller ∆t (see Figure 2).

Amorphous ice model — Here, values of ∆t are signiﬁ-
cantly lower than those obtained with the crystalline ice
model; a ∆t of 4 ± 9 days is obtained using the cen-
tral values listed in Table 2 for the initial CO/CO2 and
dust/ice ratios, leading to ft ∼ 0.2%. Higher values
of the CO/CO2 ratio never allow our model matching
the Ptolemy data: the CO/CO2 outgassing ratio is in-
creased suﬃciently high so that even its minimum be-
comes higher than the range of measurements performed
by Ptolemy. On the other hand, lower CO/CO2 ratios
increase ∆t. Interestingly, the results of this model are
poorly aﬀected by the considered dust/ice ratio. Within

mogeneous composition. In this case, the diﬀerence be-
tween the Ptolemy and ROSINA measurements is clearly
due to a heterogeneity in the nucleus composition. On
the other hand, the CO/CO2 outgassing ratio at the illu-
minated site is equal to 0.74 and 0.76 in the cases of the
amorphous ice and clathrate models, respectively. These
values are within ROSINA’s range of measurements, im-
plying that the diﬀerence of illumination is suﬃcient to
explain the diﬀerence with the CO/CO2 ratio sampled
at Abydos, assuming a homogeneous nucleus.

In summary, all possible water ice structures are able
to reproduce the observations made by Ptolemy, assum-
ing that the primordial CO/CO2 ratio is the one inferred
by ROSINA. Each case requires a unique set of input
parameters taken from the range of values inferred by
Rosetta and which describes the structure and compo-
sition of the material. According to our simulations, a
heterogeneity in the composition of 67P/C-G’s nucleus
is possible only if the nucleus is composed of crystalline
ices. However, if we consider diﬀerent ice phases like
amorphous ice or clathrates, the diﬀerence between the
Ptolemy and ROSINA measurements could simply origi-
nate from the variation of illumination between diﬀerent

regions of the nucleus.

In the upcoming months, the Philae module could
awaken and allow the Ptolemy mass spectrometer to per-
form additional measurements of the CO/CO2 ratio. By
comparing these new values with the diﬀerent CO/CO2
outgassing ratios predicted by our three models at the
same date, we would be able to see which model is the
most reliable, and thus to determine which water ice
structure is dominant at the surface of 67P/C-G’s nu-
cleus.
