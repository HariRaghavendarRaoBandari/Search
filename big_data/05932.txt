We analyze the elastic scattering of particles interacting with nuclei through vector and axial
currents with overall couplings of the order of the Standard Model weak interaction, or smaller; the
dominant contribution to the elastic cross section is identiﬁed as the coherent component and is
therefore spin-independent. Diﬀerential and integrated cross sections are obtained for a wide range
of incident particle masses and velocities and for nuclear targets with diﬀerent masses; vector, axial
and overall couplings of the incident particle and of the hadronic target to the massive exchanged
boson are also kept general. This study naturally encompasses several kinds of possible dark matter
components, including active and sterile neutrinos or neutralinos, and addresses the prospects for
their direct detection through elastic scattering oﬀ nuclei.

INTRODUCTION

Weakly interacting particles (WIPs) are natural candidates to contribute to the dark matter content of the Universe,
which accounts for around 25% of the total energy density according to growing astrophysical and cosmological
evidence [1, 2]. These observations are a consequence of the gravitational interaction of the WIPs, but they are
assumed also to participate in other interactions with strengths of the same order of, or smaller than, the Standard
Model (SM) weak neutral current (WNC); this fact opens the possibility of their direct detection, but also accounts
for its diﬃculty. Current observations favor weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), with masses from a few
keV (warm dark matter) to several GeV or TeV (cold dark matter), as the main components of dark matter in
the Universe. However, any WIP, independently of its mass, can make a contribution to the dark content whose
signiﬁcance will depend on the speciﬁc mass, energy and relic density of such particles.

We study WIPs within a wide range of velocities, or equivalently energies or momenta, as well as of masses. We
consider elementary spin-1/2 WIPs interacting through a weak-like current with arbitrary overall strength containing
a vector (polar vector) component and an axial (axial vector) component with arbitrary relative weight. We will
focus on the direct detection of the so-deﬁned WIPs through their elastic scattering oﬀ nuclei. In this process the
nature of the incoming and the outgoing WIP is the same and, given its small interaction probability, the scattering
can only manifest itself through the recoil of the nuclear target. Direct detection can be complemented with indirect
detection, based on the observation of standard particles produced in the annihilation of relic Majorana WIPs. The
existence of WIPs can also be made apparent through their production in decays or collisions that lead to missing
energy and momentum, to be reconstructed from the measurements under controlled experiments; for the production
of very heavy WIPs, experiments at high-energy facilities such as the LHC are the only option.

On the nuclear vertex, we consider an interaction involving the vector nuclear response, which is predominantly
spin-independent and where all the nucleons in the target contribute coherently to the elastic scattering cross section.
This is in contrast to the spin-dependent scattering, which depends on the nuclear spin to which only one, or at
most a few of the nucleons contribute. This is the case when the axial nuclear response is involved, which is more
sensitive to the nuclear structure and where both elastic and inelastic proceses are of interest (see, for instance, [3] for
neutralino scattering using chiral eﬀective ﬁeld theory). Another type of spin-independent interaction is the coupling
of WIP-scalar and nuclear-scalar currents, which can be also applied to elastic and inelastic processes [4].

The vector nuclear current, having a coherent component, dominates over the axial one in elastic scattering, and is
the only contribution for even-Z even-N nuclei; it will be the only contribution considered in this work. We recall that
in the WIP vertex both vector and axial components may participate in the spin-independent scattering, resulting
in the following combinations that will be computed separately: vector-WIP vector-nucleus interaction, on the one
hand, and axial-WIP vector-nucleus interaction, on the other hand; the former will be simply called vector scattering
and the latter, axial scattering, both of them spin-independent. They are not to be confused with scalar interactions,
namely scalar-WIP scalar-nucleus, which are also spin-independent. The vector and the axial currents can interfere
with each other and are therefore considered together, whereas the scalar current can be treated separately. We will
give details of the vector-axial decomposition of the WIP and nuclear currents in Sect. III. Our results focus on the
above-mentioned vector and axial spin-independent scattering for a wide range of WIP energies and masses. Both
processes have received relatively scarce attention in the literature. In the ﬁrst case, vector scattering, the reason is

that many typical dark matter candidates lack the vector current, being Majorana particles. This is the situation with
most neutralino models. In the second case, axial scattering, the reason is that the corresponding cross sections are
very small for typical dark matter kinematic conditions, namely large masses and low velocities. These circumstances
will be discussed later. In this work, both processes become fully relevant since we consider a more general set of
possible components of the dark matter content of the Universe, with wider ranges of mass and energy.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. II we introduce the kinematics of the elastic scattering, and then we
describe the dynamics in Sect. III. Results are shown in Sect. IV, and ﬁnally our main conclusions are given in Sect. V.

II. KINEMATICS

Let (cid:126)k and ε =(cid:0)k2 + m2(cid:1)1/2
(cid:0)k(cid:48)2 + m2(cid:1)1/2
of the speed of light, and γ =(cid:0)1 − β2(cid:1)−1/2
transfer is q = (cid:0)k2 + k(cid:48)2 − 2kk(cid:48) cos θ(cid:1)1/2

be the three-momentum and energy of the WIP before the scattering and (cid:126)k(cid:48) and ε(cid:48) =
the corresponding quantities after the scattering, where m is the WIP mass. The incident momentum
can be expressed in terms of the WIP mass and velocity as k = β γ m, where β = v/c is the WIP velocity v in units
. The energy transfer in the process is ω = ε − ε(cid:48), and the momentum
, where θ is the angle between (cid:126)k and (cid:126)k(cid:48), or scattering angle; in an elastic
scattering the energy and momentum loss of the projectile target turns entirely into kinetic energy and momentum
of the recoiling target, and consequently the energy and momentum transfers are related by

q =(cid:0)2 M ω + ω2(cid:1)1/2

(cid:112)

M 2 + q2 − M ,

or

ω =

(1)
where M is the target mass. The four-momentum transfer squared, Q2 = ω2 − q2, is related to the energy transfer in
an elastic scattering through |Q2| = 2M ω. We deﬁne the dark matter limit (DML) as the kinematic scenario where
the WIP mass is very large (possibly m > M ) and its speed is small, keeping the incident momentum k = β γ m
small. These are features usually attributed to dark matter particles, that are generally known as weakly interacting
massive particles, WIMPs. In this limit one has  ≈ m and (cid:48) ≈ m, so that ω ≈ 0. On the other side one has the
extreme relativistic limit (ERL), where the WIP mass is very small (clearly m << M ) and it moves at relativistic
speed, again keeping the momentum small; in this situation  ≈ k and (cid:48) ≈ k(cid:48). In both limits one has ω << q, which
holds for elastic scattering in the small q region, and more generally in the whole q range as long as k << M .

By ﬁxing the incident WIP momentum k or energy ε and the scattering angle θ, the momentum and energy of the

outgoing WIP after the elastic scattering are given by:

k(cid:48)
± =
ε(cid:48)

D = (M + ε)2 − k2 cos2 θ > 0
F = M 2 − m2 sin2 θ .

In the DML with m > M one must impose F > 0, which implies that the scattering angle lies within the range
0 ≤ θ ≤ θmax, with

θmax = arcsin(M/m) ≤ π/2 .

(6)

In this case both solutions k(cid:48)
− in Eq. (3), are valid. On the contrary, when m < M ,
as in the ERL, one has F > 0 for every scattering angle, and the only physical values of the outgoing WIP momentum
and energy are k(cid:48)

III. DYNAMICS

The initial and ﬁnal WIP spinors together with the interaction current give rise to the WIP four-tensor ηµν that
can be decomposed into a purely vector tensor (V V ), a purely axial tensor (AA) and a vector-axial interference
tensor (V A). Similarly, the nuclear spinors and the interaction current give rise to the nuclear four-tensor W µν, that
can be decomposed in the same manner. The vector and axial tensors are symmetric (s) whereas the interference

where V and A again stand for vector and axial, respectively; C, L and T /T (cid:48) stand for Coulomb (time-like), lon-
gitudinal and transverse (spatial-like) components, respectively; and (0) and (1) stand for isoscalar and isovector
components, respectively. The factors γV (0), γV (1), γA(0), γA(1) are nucleonic form factors, considered here just as
coupling constants, whose values depend on the nature of the boson exchanged between the WIP and the hadronic
target; if that boson is predominantly a Z 0, they would take values close to the SM weak neutral current (WNC)
hadronic couplings: γV (0) = βV (0) = −2 sin2 θW , γV (1) = βV (1) = 1 − 2 sin2 θW , γA(0) = βA(0) = 0, γA(1) = βA(1) = 1
(at tree level), where θW is the weak mixing angle (sin2 θW ≈ 0.23). For the SM couplings we have used the notation
and conventions in [6]. The nuclear (point-like) form factors f themselves do not include couplings.

The generalized Rosenbluth factors V in Eqs. (10)-(12) for elastic scattering can be written as [5]:

where ν = ω/q and v0 = ( + (cid:48))2 − q2. The eﬀective vector and axial WIP couplings to the exchanged boson(s) are
respectively bV and bA. For SM neutrinos, exchanging a Z 0, one has bV = aν
In the DML one has 4 m2/v0 → 1, and using the fact that ν → 0, the Rosenbluth factors in Eqs. (13)-(16) become

The time component of the DML axial current vanishes in this limit, as can be seen in V DM L
, whereas the spatial
components of the DML vector current vanish, as seen in V DM L
. Therefore, for Majorana particles,
where the vector current vanishes [7], only the space-like Rosenbluth factors are involved. On the hadronic vertex,
the space components come predominantly from the axial current (see tables with relative sizes of multipole operators
in [6] or [8]); as a consequence, for Majorana particles the dominant interaction is axial-axial, or spin-dependent (see
also the discussion in [9]).

In addition to the matrix element of the vector current vanishing for Majorana particles, eﬀectively having b(M )

V = 0,
the Majorana matrix element of the axial current is twice as large as for Dirac particles, eﬀectively having b(M )
A = 2bA,
both results coming from the fact that the charge conjugate of a Majorana fermion ﬁeld diﬀers from the ﬁeld itself
just by a phase [7]. In what follows we will keep the results for Dirac particles and assume that eﬀective couplings
b(M )
V,A as described above are to be used for Majorana particles.
We now discuss the coherent contribution to the elastic scattering cross section, where all the nucleons participate
coherently and is therefore the most important for nuclei heavier than 3He; it depends on the Coulomb vector isoscalar
monopole form factor,

corresponding to nuclear-size wavelengths and below,

may become comparable. For spin-0 (J = 0), isospin-0 (T = 0) nuclear targets, namely even-even nuclei with N = Z
and neglecting isospin mixing, the coherent contribution is actually the only one possible in elastic scattering; with
non-pure 0 isospin targets (T (cid:54)= 0) there is an additional, still Coulomb-like, contribution, and for other nuclei (J (cid:54)= 0)
the general expression in Eq. (9) applies, but in all cases the coherent contribution is dominant except for very light
nuclei. In the DML this predominant coherent matrix element squared is simply given by

namely the SM WNC, κ = GF . This cross section is valid for a fully polarized beam, as the one for SM neutrinos;
for other situations, a polarization factor P lower than 1 should be included. The recoil factor in Eq. (28) is given by

where the limit refers to ν → 0. This ratio evaluated at small momentum transfer also provides a good estimation of
the ratio of axial-to-vector integrated cross sections, σcoh(A)/σcoh(V ), since small q values give the largest contribution
to the integrated cross sections; it tends to 0 in the DML and to b2

where A(e,e) is the PV asymmetry, deﬁned as the relative diﬀerence between the cross sections of electrons with spin

The interest of this relationship lies in the fact that the electron-nucleus cross section can be measured easily, whereas
signiﬁcant progress is being made for the measurement of the PV asymmetry in elastic electron scattering (as in the
PREX or CREX experiments), and both results can then be connected to the cross section of a weak interacting
particle. In Eq. (33) the kinematic dependences of each quantity are explicitly shown. As before, κ γV (0) is the full
hadronic vector isoscalar coupling to the exchanged particle, and GF βV (0) is the full hadronic vector isoscalar SM
WNC coupling; when the WIP and the hadronic target exchange a Z 0, κ γV (0) = GF βV (0). The relationship in Eq.
(33) is strictly valid within the plane-wave Born approximation (PWBA), i.e., neglecting the eﬀect of the nuclear
Coulomb ﬁeld on the scattered electron wave function; measurements of the electron cross section and PV asymmetry
in the left-hand side of the equation naturally contain the Coulomb distortion eﬀect, but it can easily be taken into
account. The kinematic factor K depends on the electron incident momentum ke and the scattering angle θe (the
latter through the energy transfer ωe) and on a chosen WIP incident momentum k (or energy ε), as well as on the
WIP and the target masses, m and M :

IV. RESULTS

(36)

(37)

In what follows we show results for WIP-nucleus elastic scattering cross sections using a light target, 12C (Z = N =
6), and a heavy target, 208Pb (Z = 82, N = 126), and for a variety of WIP masses and velocities. The main diﬀerence
between the 12C and the 208Pb targets is that the elastic scattering cross section of the latter is roughly 300 times
larger than the former, as corresponds to the process being driven by the coherent contribution, proportional to
(N + Z)2. In addition, the coherent cross section for the 12C target is approximately equal to the full elastic cross
section, since the isovector contribution is negligible (only due to small isospin mixing); for 208Pb, on the contrary,
although the coherent contribution is as expected dominant, there is an additional isovector contribution to the elastic
cross section, which is actually the largest among the stable nuclei (N/Z is 1.54 for 208Pb).

We start by showing in Fig. 1 the proton and neutron distribution form factors of 12C and 208Pb as a function of
the momentum transfer. They have been obtained using an axially symmetric Skyrme Hartree-Fock mean ﬁeld with
BCS pairing for the ground state structure [10]. In Fig. 2 we show the vector (to the left) and axial (to the right)
longitudinal Rosenbluth factors for 12C for a WIP mass of 100 MeV and several velocities; results are very similar
for 208Pb. The results of both Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 are the basic ingredients of the cross sections to be shown in the
following ﬁgures.

In Fig. 3 we show the vector (to the left) and axial (to the right) contributions to the diﬀerential WIP-12C coherent
cross section, Eqs. (30) and (31), as a function of the momentum transfer, for diﬀerent WIP velocities β = v/c.
The same results are shown in Fig. 4 but for a 208Pb target. The cross sections are given in units of the WIP
couplings b2
A (axial contributions), but the WNC value has been used for the overall and
V (0), i.e., the exchange of a Z 0 has been considered for the sake of example. For a diﬀerent

As can be seen in these ﬁgures, for WIP masses below 100 MeV the vector contributions (solid lines) remain within
the same order of magnitude for β below 0.9, and a squared dependence of the cross section on the WIP mass is
clear in that region. The axial contributions show in the same region a squared dependence on the velocity parameter
β in addition to the mass squared dependence. These features, together with the squared target mass dependence
due to coherent dominance of the scattering, allow us to write the vector and axial cross sections for β (cid:46) 0.5 and

For the same WIP mass range but velocities closer to the speed of light there is a fast increase in the vector cross
section, whereas for WIP masses larger than 100 MeV they decrease signiﬁcantly as the WIP velocity increases. There
is a smooth transition from small to large WIP mass behaviors, and the curves coalesce for masses larger than a few
hundred GeV. As for the axial contributions (dashed lines), they increase with the WIP velocity. For masses below
100 MeV they show a fast increase in the WIP velocity ranges 0 (cid:46) β (cid:46) 0.1 and 0.9 (cid:46) β (cid:46) 1, with diﬀerent sign of the
second derivative in each region. In between, a smooth slope accounts for an increase of approximately two orders of
magnitude. For masses above 100 MeV the increase in the 0.9 (cid:46) β (cid:46) 1 region disappears, and the curves coalesce
into an approximately constant curve above β = 0.1.

The WIP mass dependence of the cross sections is more clearly seen in Fig. 7; several curves for ﬁxed WIP velocity
β are shown for a 12C target (to the left) and for a 208Pb target (to the right).
It is apparent how the curves
corresponding to the vector contribution coalesce for β (cid:46) 0.9 and m (cid:46) 100 MeV, and the ones corresponding to axial
contributions do so for β (cid:38) 0.9 and m (cid:38) 1 GeV.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the elastic scattering of weakly interacting particles (WIPs) oﬀ nuclei through vector and axial
currents with massive boson(s) exchange, such that the momentum transfers are much lower than the boson(s) mass,
MB >> Q. We have isolated the dominant contribution to the elastic cross section, namely the coherent term, which
is purely vector isoscalar on the nuclear vertex (and thus spin-independent). On the projectile vertex, both vector
and axial contributions are considered separately. We have computed coherent cross sections for a wide range of WIP
masses and velocities, as well as arbitrary WIP-boson vector and axial couplings (bV and bA), arbitrary nucleon-
boson vector isoscalar coupling (γV (0)), and arbitrary overall boson coupling (κ). The vector-current contribution
to the WIP-nucleus cross section is therefore proportional to b2
V (0) κ2, whereas the axial-current contribution
is proportional to b2
In the SM this process corresponds to active neutrino WNC scattering oﬀ nuclei
(through Z 0 exchange), where both the vector- and the axial-current parts of the cross section are proportional to

Results have been obtained for a light N = Z (isospin-0, except for small isospin mixing) target, 12C, and a heavy
N >> Z target, 208Pb. First, nuclear Coulomb form factors have been shown for each target as a function of the
momentum transfer; then the vector and the axial WIP longitudinal Rosenbluth factors have been given for diﬀerent
WIP velocities, again as a function of the momentum transfer. Using these calculations we have then obtained the
vector and the axial contributions to the diﬀerential coherent cross sections for both nuclear targets as a function
of the momentum transfer. And ﬁnally, we have shown the integrated cross sections for several WIP masses as a
function of the WIP velocities. We have found that for WIP masses below 100 MeV the vector contributions are
kept within the same order of magnitude for β below 0.9, whereas the axial contributions show in the same region
a squared dependence on the velocity parameter β; in both cases there is a WIP mass squared dependence, as well
as a target mass squared dependence due to coherence. As the WIP velocity approaches the light limit the vector
cross section increases rapidly when the WIP mass is below 100 MeV, but it decreases when the WIP mass is above
approximately 100 MeV. The curves change smoothly as the WIP mass increases, particularly in the 100 MeV region.
As for the axial contributions, for masses below 100 MeV they increase with the WIP velocity, rapidly in the regions
0 (cid:46) β (cid:46) 0.1 and 0.9 (cid:46) β (cid:46) 1, and smoothly in between; for masses above 100 MeV the increase in the 0.9 (cid:46) β (cid:46) 1
region disappears, and the curves coalesce into an approximately constant curve above β = 0.1. The vector and axial
integrated cross sections have also been plotted against the WIP masses for several WIP velocities, to show more
clearly the WIP mass dependence.

Using the coherent WIP-nucleus cross sections obtained above it is possible to estimate the number of events of
this kind expected in a given detector. The number of detections per year per ton of a given target material can be
estimated as:

(40)
where F is the WIP ﬂux, given in s−1cm−2, σ is the WIP-target coherent cross section, given in MeV−2 as in the
results of the previous section, and A is the mass number of the target material. For example, for the cross sections
of Eqs. (39), the number of expected detections per year per ton is:

The latter expressions are not given for a Z 0 exchange, but instead for a more general boson with vector isoscalar
hadronic coupling γV (0) and overall coupling κ, whose values are to be provided by a particular WIP theory. The
overall coupling in the previous expressions must be introduced in MeV−2 (since it is an eﬀective coupling, for
MB >> Q) and the WIP and target masses in MeV.

Since the WIPs are supposed to be very elusive particles, their elastic interaction with nuclei can only be detected
through the nuclear recoil caused by the scattering; the same happens with the SM neutrinos in elastic neutral current
scattering from nuclei. Therefore, in addition to the expected number of events, it is also important to know the
expected nuclear recoil, since very small values are very hard to detect. However, recoil energy thresholds as low as
a few keV might be possible in the near future for a wide variety of detection techniques (scintillation, ionization,
tracking, bubble chamber, etc.) and materials (noble liquids, semiconductor solids, etc.); masses of target materials
might also reach in the near future the ton scale [11]. From energy conservation, the recoil energy of the nuclear
target is equal to the energy carried by the boson, namely the energy transfer. We have given results for diﬀerential
cross sections as a function of the momentum transfer q, that can be easily translated into recoil energy using the

condition of elastic scattering (Eq. (1)): Erec = ω =(cid:112)M 2 + q2 − M .
