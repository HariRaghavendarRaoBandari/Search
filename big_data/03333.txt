We revisit a set of dark sector models, motivated by anomalies observed in B decays and the muon
anomalous magnetic moment, in the light of a recently reported diphoton excess around 750 GeV.
Interpreting the excess as a scalar resonance associated with the symmetry breaking sector of a dark
gauge group, we show that a diphoton cross section of few fb can be accomodated, together with
anomalies in RK and gµ − 2 within a minimal dark sector model. The resulting prominent collider
signatures are in the form of wide resonant signals into top and muon pair ﬁnal states below ∼ 1 TeV.
The model further predicts a dark matter candidate, yet with a signiﬁcantly underabundant relic
density, unless produced by an appropriate non-thermal mechanism.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Nature seems malicious. While naturalness signals are
lacking at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the AT-
LAS [1] and CMS [2] collaborations recently reported an
excess in the diphoton invariant mass distribution around
750 GeV with a (local) signiﬁcance of 3.9σ and 2.6σ, re-
spectively. Numerous interpretations of such a signal are
possible, see e.g. [3–7]. The simplest explanation is the
production of a new resonance X of spin zero or two [8, 9].
The number of events observed in excess of the diphoton
background corresponds to a signal cross section of

σ(pp → X → γγ) ∼ 5 fb ,

(1)

√

s = 13 TeV. Such a large cross section requires
at
the resonance to be accompanied by new particles [10]
in order to enhance the diphoton branching ratio (BR)
of X and most likely also its production rate. A puta-
tive diphoton signal only provides rather limited decisive
information regarding the associated underlying physics
beyond the SM, although some interesting constraints
could be derived on its couplings to SM states [6, 10–13].
Most notably, nothing in current data clearly indicates
whether such a resonance is playing a role in electroweak
symmetry breaking, except perhaps a fortuitous resem-
blance with the Higgs boson discovery [14, 15].

A possible strategy towards a less ambiguous interpre-
tation of the diphoton resonance might be to combine
it with other intriguing anomalies persisting in the low-
energy data. Here, we consider a minimal model that was
initially introduced to explain a series of anomalies in ob-
servables involving muons [16]. (See Refs. [17, 18] for an
alternative approach.) This includes the long-standing
3σ deviation in aµ = (gµ− 2)/2, the anomalous magnetic
moment of the muon [19, 20],

as well as a recent deviation in the ratio RK = BR(B+ →
K +µ+µ−)/BR(B+ → K +e+e−). The latter was ob-
served about 2.6 σ below the theoretically clean SM pre-
diction of RSM

pointing to sources of new physics in b → sµ+µ− tran-
sitions at short distances also supported by measure-
ments of decay rate for B0 → K 0(∗)µ+µ− [22] and
B0 → φµ+µ− [23], as well as angular distributions in
B0 → K 0∗µ+µ− [24]. Several scenarios were proposed to
explain the gµ − 2 and b → sµµ results [16, 17, 25, 26].
An interesting possibility consists of introducing a mas-
sive Z(cid:48) vector boson which couples to muon pairs only
radiatively, such that the same interaction induces the
required new contributions to both b → sµµ transitions
and gµ−2 [16]. Such a scenario calls for additional states,
in particular new scalars and vector-like fermions, one of
which could play the role of dark matter (DM). Moreover,
the annihilation cross section at thermal decoupling for
scalar DM is typically dominated by the very same inter-
action responsible for the muon-related anomalies, thus
resulting in a cosmological relic close to the observed
value. Finally, the scalar excitation in the direction of
the vacuum expectation value (VEV) generating the Z(cid:48)
mass could be identiﬁed to the 750 GeV resonance hinted
at ATLAS and CMS (see also Refs. [27–29]), with cou-
plings to gluons and photons conveniently enhanced by
the vector-like quarks inherent in the model. Hence, the
phenomenological model proposed in Ref. [16] has all the
ingredients to further explain the diphoton excess.

Our aim in this paper is to investigate whether this
simple model which explain two muon-related anomalies
can reproduce the large cross section required to ﬁt the
diphoton excess while satisfying all current collider con-
straints. Since the anomalies require a Z(cid:48) below the TeV
scale, one of the most important constraint on the model
comes from searches for Z(cid:48), notably in the t¯t and µ+µ−
channels. We show that all the above collider hints of
new physics can be explained simultaneously, but only
at the expense of a largely underabundant dark matter,

II. THE MODEL

The model is a simple extension of the Standard Model
(SM) with a new sector charged under a U(1)X gauge
group, under which the SM states are neutral. We will
refer to all particles with X (cid:54)= 0 as ”dark”. Besides the
U(1)X gauge ﬁeld Z(cid:48)
µ, the new sector consists of a vector-
like quark doublets Q, Qc and a pair of vector-like lepton
doublets L, Lc and ˜L, ˜Lc for each generation, as well as
two SM singlet complex scalars φ and χ. The charges of
the new particles under the SM and U (1)X groups are
listed in Table II. Note that the ratio of heavy lepton to
heavy quark numbers is inversely proportional to their
X charge ratio, thus keeping radiative contributions to
the kinetic mixing of U (1)X with the SM hypercharge
insensitive to unknown dynamics at the high scales [30].
The Lagrangian of the model is L = LSM + Ldark −
Lportal, where LSM denotes the SM part, and
Ldark = |Dµφ|2 + |Dµχ|2 − V (φ, χ)

ﬁeld associated with the longitudinal component of the
massive Z(cid:48), while ϕ is identiﬁed with the diphoton res-
onance ATLAS and CMS hinted, mϕ ≈ 750 GeV. The
scalar and pseudoscalar components of χ display a mass

The φ kinetic term provides a coupling of ϕ to Z(cid:48) pairs
of 4g(cid:48)mZ(cid:48), while ϕ couplings to χ0 and χ(cid:48) pairs are
mZ(cid:48)/(2g(cid:48))[λφχ ± 2δ(g(cid:48)mχ0)2/m2
Z(cid:48)], respectively. At tree-
level, the scalar ϕ also couples to the SM Higgs and
quarks. Note that, by construction ϕ does not couple
classically to leptons, nor to SM gauge bosons.
The X charge assignment of Table II forbids χ0 and
χ(cid:48) couplings to quarks. Although their couplings to lep-
tons y, ˜y could lead a priori to lepton ﬂavor violating ef-
fects, we assume here that both are aligned with the SM
charged lepton masses. Furthermore, we take for sim-
plicity ˜y = y and M ˜L = ML. Motivated by the observed
lepton non-universality (LNU) in semileptonic B decays,
we further take ye (cid:28) yµ, while yτ is left unspeciﬁed. This
captures the relevant ingredients required to address the
RK anomaly.
The Z(cid:48) couples to SM fermions only through U(1)X
breaking eﬀects. Z(cid:48) couplings to SM quark doublets arise
at tree-level through mass mixing with Q, while there is
no mixing with SM singlets. This results in partially
dark left-handed (LH) SM quarks with, schematically,
qSM ≡ cos θ q + sin θ QL, the angle θ measuring their
“degree of darkness”. Explaining b → sµµ anomalies
requires ﬂavour mixing in the quark sector, in particu-
lar a ﬂavour changing Z(cid:48) coupling between bL and sL
quarks. This is realized through an appropriate ﬂavour
structure in the dark quark spectrum MQ and the por-
tal coupling w. A suﬃcient set of conditions is that i)
the unitary matrix VQ, which parameterizes the misalign-
†
ment between w†w and M
QMQ, is not proportional to
the identity matrix and ii) MQ is not degenerate. For
simplicity, we limit ourselves to mixings among the sec-
ond and third quark generations and neglect possible CP-
violating phases. Then, as shown in Appendix A, VQ is
simply an orthogonal matrix of angle θQ and the tree-
level Z(cid:48) couplings to LH quark currents are (in units of
g(cid:48))

¯ss,¯bb = 2(cid:0)cos2 θQ sin2 θs,b + sin2 θQ sin2 θb,s

Note that, sin θs/ sin θb = mQ3/mQ2 as a result of the
assumed w degeneracy. Moreover, since the mass mixing
preserves SU(2)L, the same coupling structure applies to
the up-quark sector.
In constrast, the Z(cid:48) does not couple to SM leptons
at tree-level due to the absence of mixing with heavy
leptons. For δ (cid:54)= 0, such a coupling is induced at one-
loop level with gZ(cid:48)
¯µµ = y2/16π2F (τ, δ) where F is a loop
function deﬁned in [16], τ ≡ M 2
χ. As long as ML (cid:46)
800 GeV and δ (cid:29) 1, this allows to simultaneously explain
the b → sµµ and gµ − 2 anomalies [16].

Finally, consider the ϕ interactions with quarks. Since
the right-handed (RH) SM quarks do not mix with Q,
there is no ϕ¯qq couplings in the mass basis, but only ϕ¯qQ
and ϕ ¯QQ couplings. For the ﬂavour structure assumed
above, those are

respectively, with similar expressions for charm and top
quarks. Note the absence of ﬂavor changing ϕ couplings,
which is a mere consequence of the assumed ﬂavour uni-
versality of w. The ϕ ¯QQ couplings will play a crucial role
in producing ϕ through gluon fusion with a large rate, as
well as enhancing its branching ratio in diphotons, in
particular for mQ2,3 ∼ mϕ.

III. ADDRESSING COLLIDER ANOMALIES

Consider ﬁrst the sizable resonant cross section of ϕ in
the diphoton channel in Eq. (1). Since ϕ does not cou-
ple at tree-level to SM quark pairs, nor to vector boson
pairs, its production at the LHC is dominated by gluon
fusion through a loop of both isospin components of the
vector-like quarks Q2,3. Using the generic expressions for
loop-induced scalar couplings to a pair of gluons, see e.g.
Ref. [31], and MSTW parton distribution functions [32]
at leading order, we ﬁnd

for mQ3 = mQ2 (sin θs/ sin θb) = 800 GeV. I(x), with
x ≡ sin θs/ sin θb, is the Q2-to-Q3 loop amplitude ratio,
satisfying I(1) = 1 and I(x) (cid:39) x3 for x (cid:28) 1, and the mul-
tiplicative factor kQCD captures unspeciﬁed higher-order
QCD corrections. Hence, the branching ratio ϕ → γγ
must be at least O(10−3) in order to reach the high sig-
nal rate of Eq. 1. In the minimal setup considered in this

3

letter, this is only achievable by i) boosting the γγ par-
tial width with loops of Q2,3 and, most importantly, ii)
suppressing all tree-level two-body decays, in particular
ϕ → Z(cid:48)Z(cid:48), ϕ → χχ and ϕ → qQ, as well as poten-
tially sizable three-body decays into Z(cid:48) ¯qq (q = s, c, b, t).
Avoiding overly-large widths in tree-level two-body de-
cays requires mZ(cid:48) > mϕ/2, mχ > mϕ/2 and mQ > mϕ.
Three-body decays into Z(cid:48) ¯qq arise through either one
oﬀ-shell Z(cid:48) ( ϕ → Z(cid:48)Z(cid:48)∗ → Z(cid:48)q ¯q) or one oﬀ-shell Q
(ϕ → ¯qQ∗ → ¯qqZ(cid:48)). Both can give important contri-
butions to the total width, thus imposing a further con-
straint on the Z(cid:48) mass. While the later depends on the
couplings involved it roughly requires mZ(cid:48) (cid:38) 650GeV.
In this case, ϕ is found to decay dominantly into gluons,
with Γϕ (cid:39) Γ(ϕ → gg) ∼ O(1) GeV, while the diphoton
partial width is found to be

Γ(ϕ → γγ) ≈ 0.77 MeV ×

corresponding to BR(ϕ → γγ) ∼ O(10−3). Combining
the above with Eq. (12) gives a diphoton signal in the
ballpark of Eq. (1) provided sin θb,s ≈ 1.
The second request is to explain both the RK and
gµ − 2 anomalies. RK is addressed by a Z(cid:48) mediated
contribution to the (¯bs)V −A(¯µµ)V −A local operator at
the bottom mass scale. The ﬂavor changing Z(cid:48) cou-
pling sourcing the new b → sµµ amplitude is strongly
constrained by ¯Bs − Bs oscillations. Restricting the
Z(cid:48) contribution to the mass diﬀerence of neutral Bs
(cid:46)
mesons to 10% of the SM contribution gives gZ(cid:48)
¯bs
5.2×10−3(mZ(cid:48)/650 GeV)/g(cid:48) [33, 34]. As a result, the cen-
tral value of RK in Eq. (3) requires a rather large Z(cid:48)-to-

Through a loop of χ and vector-like leptons, the same
interaction induces a gµ − 2 contribution of ∆aµ =

G(τ, δ), where G(τ, δ) is a loop function de-
ﬁned in [16]. Saturating the lower bound in Eq. (14),
the discrepancy in Eq. (2) is accomodated for mχ0 ≈
400 GeV, which is consistent with mχ0 > mϕ/2 neces-
sary to maintain a large BR(ϕ → γγ).

In order to assess the robustness of the above discus-
sion, we varied the input parameters of the model within
0.5 < g(cid:48) < 4, 1 < y < 4π, 550 < mZ(cid:48) < 950 GeV,
750 < mQ2,3 < 1800 GeV, 375 < mχ0 < 800 GeV,
1 < ML/mχ0 < 3, 0 < δ < 20, 0 < sin θs,b < 1 and
| sin θQ| < 1. The parameters of the Higgs potential do
not enter the observables directly and λφχ does not play
an important role here, thus we simply set them to zero.
We will comment latter on their possible impact when

discussing DM observables. For each point in parame-
ter space, we computed the diphoton cross section of the
ϕ scalar, gµ − 2 and RK. Cross sections and DM ob-
servables were computed using micrOMEGAs 4 [35] and
CalcHEP 3.4 [36]. Our main result is displayed in Fig. 1
which shows that the observed diphoton rate can be ac-
comodated, together with b → sµµ and gµ− 2 anomalies.
However, for σ13(pp → S → γγ) (cid:38) 4fb, there is a tension
with concomitant resonance searches in top and muon
pairs as discussed next.

IV. COLLIDER CONSTRAINTS AND

SIGNATURES

The Z(cid:48) necessarily have sizable couplings to second and
third generation quark pairs. Indeed, those are related to
the ϕ-to-vector quark couplings which needs to be O(1)
to sustain a large diphoton signal. As a result, the model
potentially faces several constraints from various reso-
nance searches at the LHC. Consider for illustration the
case of a 650 GeV Z(cid:48). With MSTW PDFs [32], the lead-
ing order production cross section at the 8 TeV LHC is

σ8(pp → Z(cid:48)) ≈ 56 pb × g(cid:48)2(cid:0)sin4 θs + 0.13 sin4 θb

(cid:1) , (15)

where the ﬁrst (second) term in parenthesis represents
the contribution from ¯cc+ ¯ss (¯bb) annihilation. The cross
section is a factor of ∼ 5 larger at 13 TeV. With a typical
O(1) BR into jet pairs, this signal is generically larger
than that probed in dijet resonance searches in this mass
range by an order of magnitude [37]. However, note that
for sin θb (cid:39) sin θs ≈ 1 the Z(cid:48) is unavoidably wide. With
typically ΓZ(cid:48)/mZ(cid:48) (cid:38) 30%, the above searches, which
strongly rely on bump-hunting techniques, are expected
to be less sensitive to such broad Z(cid:48) states.
On the other hand, a signiﬁcant constraint arises from
t¯t resonance searches, which set an upper limit of ∼ 2 pb
for 650 GeV vector resonances as wide as 40% [38]. This
constraint is easily avoided by taking either sin θb (cid:28) 1,
thus suppressing the Z(cid:48) → ¯tt decay, or sin θs (cid:28) 1, thus
reducing the overall Z(cid:48) production cross section. Conse-
quently, ϕ couples mostly to second or third generation
quarks, but not both. Either way, this results in smaller
loop-induced ϕ couplings to gluons and photons which
limits the diphoton signal to (cid:39) 4 fb, as shown in Fig. 1. A
cleaner Z(cid:48) signature is in the dimuon channel. However,
the associated partial width is loop-induced with typi-
cally BR(Z(cid:48) → µ+µ−) ∼ O(10−3) or less. This results in
8 TeV cross sections as large as O(0.1) pb, which is in an
order of magnitude tension with current data [39]. Again,
this can be avoided for sin θs (cid:28) 1. Note that, since the
partial Z(cid:48) width in muon pairs is independent of sin θb,s,
there is no correlation between the dimuon channel and
the diphoton cross section. Imposing a diphoton signal
strength above 1 fb, as well as the ¯tt and µ+µ− upper lim-
its from the 8 TeV data, the 13 TeV dimuon cross section
is still allowed by current data [40], see Fig. 2.

strength and the top pair production cross section from reso-
nant Z(cid:48), for diﬀerent Z(cid:48) width regime.

The model also predicts collider signatures involving
the new vector-like quarks and leptons. EW production
of heavy lepton pairs leads to µ+µ− with missing energy
in the ﬁnal state, which is constrained by LHC data [41]
unless ML > 450GeV and/or ML − mχ0
(cid:46) 60 GeV [16].
Heavy quarks are mostly pair produced through QCD
interactions. When decays into an EW state (W, Z, h)
and a jet are dominant, strong limits of ∼ 600− 900 GeV
typically apply [42–44]. However, in most of the favoured
parameter space, heavy quarks escape these limits since
they preferably decay into Q → Z(cid:48)q or Q → ϕq, leading
to distinctive ﬁnal states with leptons and/or multiple
jet.

Finally, the model predicts further signatures of the
750 GeV scalar. In addition to the dominant decay mode
into gluon pairs, ϕ can decay into Z(cid:48)q ¯q, however this
branching ratio is at most 10% for points with a large
diphoton cross section and it drops rapidly with mZ(cid:48).
Resonant signals in Zγ, ZZ, W W with cross sections
of the same order as the diphoton rate are also ex-
pected. Moreover, there is a possible monojet signal
from the s-channel exchange of an oﬀ-shell ϕ, yet with
a cross section which is at least one order of magni-
tude below current LHC sensitivity [45, 46]. By SU(2)L
invariance, the model predicts t → c decays through
loops of Z(cid:48) and quarks. Besides the loop factor sup-
pression, these FCNC signals suﬀer a strong GIM-like
suppression. For instance, the ZtLcL coupling is typ-
ically O[V ∗

and muon-neutrino pairs through t-channel exchange
of vector-like leptons. Under the gµ − 2 and RK re-
quests, DM was found to be signiﬁcantly underdense un-
less mχ0 (cid:39) 100 GeV [16].
In constrast, the further re-
quirement of a large diphoton cross section implies that
mχ0 > mϕ/2 ≈ 375 GeV. As a result, χ0 can only be a
viable DM candidate if produced by an adequate non-
thermal mechanism [49–51]1. Assuming such a mecha-
nism exists, direct DM detection could still probe the
model. The expected cross section strongly depends on
the parameters of the scalar potential in Eq. (6).
In
particular λhχ controls the SM Higgs exchange contri-
bution between DM and nuclei, while r ∝ δ and λφχ
set the 750 GeV scalar contribution. Taking into ac-
count only the ϕ exchange contribution proportional to
r and restricting to diphoton signals above 1 fb, we ﬁnd
spin independent cross sections as large as ∼ 10−8 pb
for mχ0 ≈ 400 GeV, which is in tension with limits from
the LUX experiment [52], see Fig. 3. Furthermore, bar-
ring cancellations with other contributions to the spin
independent cross section, future direct detection exper-
iments will probe the bulk of the parameter space.

Another possiblity is that the DM is identiﬁed with
the neutral vector-like lepton (τ < 1). However, in this
case, the sizable DM interactions with the SM Z and the
Z(cid:48) states yields an overly suppressed relic density as well
as spin-independent scattering cross sections on nuclei
that exceed current bounds by several orders of magni-
tude [52]. This situation is akin to the supersymmetric
partner of SM neutrinos [53].

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We revisited a class of dark sector models originally
proposed to simultaneously explain the reported anoma-
lies in gµ − 2 and b → sµ+µ− decays [16]. In this letter,
we observe that these models can further accomodate
the large diphoton excess reveiled by recent LHC data.
The diphoton signal arises from a scalar resonance as-
sociated to the dark U(1)X breaking sector. While sim-
ilar interpretations of the 750 GeV diphoton excess at
the LHC exist in the literature, we show that combining
the above hints of physics beyond the Standard Model
signiﬁcantly limits the viable region of parameter space
in such models. Under the requirement of explaining the
muon-related anomalies, we ﬁnd that either the diphoton
signal is negligible or the relic density of the dark matter
is orders of magnitude smaller than the level suggested
by CMB observations. This illustrates how addressing
several anomalies in a coherent framework could yield
valuable informations about the underlying physics at
play.

1 An alternate possibility is that the observed value of the relic
density is mostly in the form of an another DM state. In this case,
the collider anomalies under consideration are largely unrelated
to DM phenomenology.
