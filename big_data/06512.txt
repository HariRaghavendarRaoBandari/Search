Conjecture and improved extension theorems for paraboloids in

the ﬁnite ﬁeld setting

Doowon Koh

Abstract. We study the extension estimates for paraboloids in d-dimensional vector spaces over
ﬁnite ﬁelds Fq with q elements. We use the connection between L2 based restriction estimates and
Lp → Lr extension estimates for paraboloids. As a consequence, we improve the L2 → Lr extension
results obtained by A. Lewko and M. Lewko [10] in even dimensions d ≥ 6, and odd dimensions
d = 4ℓ + 3 for ℓ ∈ N. Our results extend the consequences for 3-D paraboloids due to M. Lewko [8]
to higher dimensions on which additional diﬃculties exist. We also clariﬁes conjectures on ﬁnite
ﬁeld extension problems for paraboloids.

1. Introduction

Let V ⊂ Rd be a hypersurface which is endowed with a surface measure dσ. In the Euclidean
setting, the extension problem is to determine the exponents 1 ≤ p, r ≤ ∞ such that the following
inequality holds:

k(f dσ)∨kLr (Rd) ≤ Ckf kLp(V,dσ),

where the constant C > 0 is independent of functions f ∈ Lp(V, dσ). By duality, this extension
estimate is same as the restriction estimate below

kbgkLp′ (V,dσ) ≤ CkgkLr′ (Rd).

Here, p′ and r′ denote the H¨older conjugates of p and r, respectively (i.e. 1/p+1/p′ = 1). Therefore,
the extension problem is also called the restriction problem. In 1967, E.M. Stein [12] introduced
the restriction problem. This problem had been completely solved for the parabola and the circle
in two dimensions, and the cones in three and four dimensions (see [18, 1, 17]). However, it is
still open in other cases although improved results have been obtained by harmonic analysts. We
refer readers to [3, 13, 14, 15] for further information and recent developments on the restriction
problem in the Euclidean setting.

In 2002, Mockenhaupt and Tao [11] initially posed and studied the extension problem for
various varieties in d-dimensional vector spaces over ﬁnite ﬁelds.
In order to formulate a ﬁnite
analogue of the extension problem, the real set is replaced by ﬁnite ﬁelds. We begin by reviewing
the deﬁnition of the ﬁnite ﬁeld extension problem. We denote by Fq a ﬁnite ﬁeld with q element.
Throughout this paper, we shall assume that q is a power of odd prime. Let Fd
q be a d-dimensional
vector space over the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq. We endow the vector space Fd
q with the counting measure dm.
We write (Fd

The number R∗
V (p → r) may depend on q, the size of the underlying ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq. The main
question on the extension problem for V ⊂ Fd
q is to determine 1 ≤ p, r ≤ ∞ such that the number
R∗
V (p → r) is independent of q. Throughout this paper, we shall use X . Y for X, Y > 0 if there is
a constant C > 0 independent of q = |Fq| such that X ≤ CY. We also write Y & X for X . Y, and
X ∼ Y means that X . Y and Y . X. In addition, we shall use X / Y if for every ε > 0 there
exists Cε > 0 such that X . CεqεY. This notation is handy for suppressing powers of log q. Using
the notation ., the extension problem for V is to determine 1 ≤ p, r ≤ ∞ such that R∗
V (p → r) . 1.

Since the ﬁnite ﬁled extension problem was addressed in 2002 by Mockenhaupt and Tao [11],
it has been studied for several algebraic varieties such as paraboloids, spheres, and cones (see,
for example, [8, 10, 6, 5, 7].)
In particular, very interesting results have been recovered for
paraboloids. From now on, we restrict ourselves to the study of the extension problem for the
paraboloid P ⊂ (F d

q , dξ) deﬁned as

(1.1)

P = {ξ ∈ Fd

q : ξd = ξ2

d−1}.

This paper is written with two main goals. One is to address clariﬁed conjectures on the extension
problem for paraboloids, which may prevent to go the wrong path. The other is to improve the
previously known L2 → Lr extension estimates for paraboloids in higher dimensions.

In Section 2, we shall introduce neat necessary conditions which we may conjecture as suﬃcient
P (p → r) . 1. In particular, we may conjecture the following statement on the

conditions for R∗
L2 − Lr extension problem for paraboloids (see Lemma 2.3).

Conjecture 1.1. Let P ⊂ Fd
(1) If d ≥ 2 is even, then R∗
(2) If d = 4ℓ − 1 for ℓ ∈ N, and −1 ∈ Fq is not a square number, then we have

q be the paraboloid deﬁned as in (1.1). Then we have
P (2 → r) . 1 ⇐⇒ 2d+4

d ≤ r ≤ ∞

R∗

P (2 → r) . 1 ⇐⇒

2d + 6
d + 1

≤ r ≤ ∞

(3) If d = 4ℓ + 1 for ℓ ∈ N, then R∗
(4) If d ≥ 3 is odd, and −1 ∈ Fq is a square number, then we have

P (2 → r) . 1 ⇐⇒ 2d+2

d−1 ≤ r ≤ ∞

R∗

P (2 → r) . 1 ⇐⇒

2d + 2
d − 1

≤ r ≤ ∞.

In the conclusions of Conjecture 1.1, the statements for “ =⇒ ” direction follow immediately
from Lemma 2.3 in the following section. Hence, Conjecture 1.1 can be reduced to the following
critical endpoint estimate, because R∗

P (2 → r2) for 1 ≤ r1 ≤ r2 ≤ ∞.

P (2 → r1) ≥ R∗

3

Conjecture 1.2. Let P ⊂ Fd
(1) If d ≥ 2 is even, then R∗
(2) If d = 4ℓ − 1 for ℓ ∈ N, and −1 ∈ Fq is not a square number, then R∗

P (cid:0)2 → 2d+4

q be the paraboloid deﬁned as in (1.1). Then we have

d (cid:1) . 1
P (cid:16)2 → 2d+2

d−1(cid:17) . 1

(3) If d = 4ℓ + 1 for ℓ ∈ N, then R∗

(4) If d ≥ 3 is odd, and −1 ∈ Fq is a square number, then R∗

d+1(cid:17) . 1

P (cid:16)2 → 2d+6
d−1(cid:17) . 1.

P (cid:16)2 → 2d+2

Remark 1.3. In [9], progress on the ﬁnite ﬁeld restriction conjecture for the paraboloid was
summarized, where the conjectures on L2 − Lr extension problems are misspelled in the case of
higher even dimensions and higher odd dimensions. Conjecture 1.1 are more reasonable than them.

1.1. Statement of main results. By the Stein-Tomas argument, Mockenhaupt and Tao [11]
already showed that the statements (3) and (4) of Conjecture 1.2 are true. In fact, they obtained
the Stein-Tomas inequality by showing R∗
P (2 → (2d + 2)/(d − 1)) . 1 for all dimensions d ≥ 2
without further assumptions.

The statements (1) and (2) of Conjecture 1.2 are very interesting in that the conjectured results
are better than the Stein-Tomas inequality which is sharp in the Euclidean case. This is due to
number theoretic issue which we can enjoy when we study harmonic analysis in ﬁnite ﬁelds. In
dimension two, the statement (1) of Conjecture 1.2 was already proved by Mockenhaupt and Tao
[11], but it is open in higher even dimensions. For higher even dimensions d ≥ 4, Iosevich and
Koh [4] proved that R∗
P (2 → 2d2/(d2 − 2d + 2)) / 1 which improves the Stein-Tomas inequality
due to Mockenhaupt and Tao. This result was obtained by using a connection between Lp → L4
extension results and L2 → Lr extension estimates. In [10], A. Lewko and M. Lewko improved
the result of Iosevich and Koh by recovering the endpoint. They adapted the bilinear approach to
derive the improved result, R∗
P (2 → 2d2/(d2 − 2d + 2)) . 1. In this paper, we shall obtain further
improvement in higher even dimensions d ≥ 6. Our ﬁrst main result is as follow.

Theorem 1.4. Let P ⊂ Fd

q be the paraboloid deﬁned as in (1.1). If the dimension d ≥ 6 is

even, then for each ε > 0 we have

P (cid:18)2 →

R∗

6d + 8
3d − 2

+ ε(cid:19) . 1.

Notice that if d ≥ 6, then (6d + 8)/(3d − 2) < 2d2/(d2 − 2d + 2), which implies that Theorem

1.4 is better than the result R∗

P (2 → 2d2/(d2 − 2d + 2)) . 1 due to A. Lewko and M. Lewko.

The statement (2) of Conjecture 1.2 has not been solved in any case. In the case when d = 3
and q is a prime with q ≡ 3 (mod 4), Mockenhaupt and Tao [11] deduced the following extension
result: for every ε > 0,

P (2 → 18

This was improved to R∗
5 ) . 1 by A. Lewko and M. Lewko [10] (Bennett, Carbery,
Garrigos, and Wright independently proved it in unpublished work). Recently, Lewko [8] discovered
a nice connection between the ﬁnite ﬁeld extension problem and the ﬁnite ﬁeld Szemer´edi-Trotter
incidence problem. Using the connection with ingenious arguments, he obtained the currently best
known result on extension problems for the 3-d paraboloid. More precisely, he proved that if the
dimension d is three and −1 ∈ Fq is not a square, then there exists an ε > 0 such that

Furthermore, assuming that q is a prime and −1 ∈ Fq is not a square, he gave the following explicit

Although this result is still far from the conjectured result, R∗
P (2 → 3) . 1, M. Lewko provided
novel ideas useful in developing the ﬁnite ﬁeld extension problem and we will also adapt many of his
methods to deduce our improved results. In speciﬁc higher odd dimensions, Iosevich and Koh [4]
proved that R∗
d2−2d+2 ) / 1 under the assumptions for the statement (2) of Conjecture 1.2.
This result is also better than the Stein-Tomas inequality. A. Lewko and M. Lewko [10] obtained
the endpoint estimate so that the result by Iosevich and Koh was improved to

P (2 → 2d2

(1.5)

P (cid:18)2 →

R∗

As our second result, we shall improve the result in the case when d = 4ℓ − 1 ≥ 7 for ℓ ∈ N. More
precisely, we have the following result.

Theorem 1.5. Let P ⊂ Fd

q be the paraboloid deﬁned as in (1.1). If d = 4ℓ + 3 for ℓ ∈ N, and

−1 ∈ Fq is not a square number, then for every ε > 0, we have

P (cid:18)2 →

R∗

3d − 1

+ ε(cid:19) . 1.

Notice that Theorem 1.5 is superior to the result (1.5) due to A. Lewko and M. Lewko. If one
could obtain the exponent in Theorem 1.5 for d = 3, we could have R∗
2 + ε) . 1, which
is much better than the best known result (1.4) due to M. Lewko. Unfortunately, our result does
not cover the case of three dimensions and it only improves the previous known results in speciﬁc
higher odd dimensions.

P (2 → 7

1.2. Outline of this paper. In section 2, we deduce necessary conditions for R∗

P (p → r)
bound from which we make a conjecture on extension problems for paraboloids. In section 3, we
collect several lemmas which are essential in proving our main results, Theorem 1.4 and Theorem
1.5. In the ﬁnal section, we give the complete proofs of our main theorems. In the end of this
paper, we shall provide summary of progress on the ﬁnite ﬁeld extension problems for paraboloids.

2. Conjecture on extension problems for paraboloids

In [11], Mockenhaupt and Tao observed that if |V | ∼ qd−1, then the necessary conditions for

R∗

V (p → r) . 1 are given by

(2.1)

r ≥

d − 1

and r ≥

In particular, when the variety V contains an aﬃne subspace Ω with |Ω| = qk for 0 ≤ k ≤ d, the
above necessary conditions can be improved by

(2.2)

r ≥

Corollary 2.2. Let P ⊂ Fd

q be the paraboloid deﬁned as in (1.1). Then we have

(1) If d ≥ 2 is even, then the paraboloid P contains a subspace Ω with |Ω| = q

to solve the extension problem for paraboloids, it suﬃces to establish the following conjecture on

In this section, we collect several lemmas which are applied to prove our main results. As we
shall see, Theorem 1.4 and Theorem 1.5 will be proved by the restriction estimates (dual extension
estimate). Thus, we start with lemmas for the restriction operators associated with paraboloids.
We shall write RP (p → r) for R∗
P (r′ → p′) for 1 ≤ p, r ≤ ∞. Namely, RP (p → r) is the smallest
positive real number such that the following restriction estimate holds:

kbgkLr(P,dσ) ≤ RP (p → r) kgkLp(Fd

We say that the set G is a regular set if

Notice that if G is a regular set, then |G| ∼ |Ga||LG| for each a ∈ LG. By the the dyadic

pigeonhole principle, the following lemma was given by M. Lewko (see Lemma 14 in [8]).

Lemma 3.2. If the restriction estimate

holds for all regular functions g : (Fd

kbgkLr(P,dσ) ≤ RP (p → r) kgkLp(Fd

q, dm) → C, then for each ε > 0,

q ,dm)

RP (p − ε → r) . 1.

Working on regular test functions, we lose the endpoint result but our analysis can be extremely
simple. When the size of the support G of a regular function g is big, then the following restriction
estimate will be used.

Lemma 3.3. Let g is a regular function on (Fd

q , dm) with supp(g) = G. Then we have

Improved Lp → L2 restriction estimates for paraboloids have been obtained by applying an
idea of Carbery [2] to ﬁnite ﬁeld case. For example, Mockenhaupt and Tao [11] observed that the
restriction operator acting on a single vertical slice of g, say ga for a ∈ Fq, is closely related to the
extension operator applied to a function h on P , which can be identiﬁed with the slice function ga.
In fact, they utilized the connection between the Lp → L2 restriction estimate and the Lp → L4
extension estimate which can be obtained from the additive energy estimation. Recall that the
additive energy Λ(E) for E ⊂ P is given by

(3.1)

Λ(E) :=

Xx,y,z,w∈E:x+y=z+w

1.

As a consequence, they obtained the extension result (1.2) for the 3-D paraboloid. Working with
the restriction operator applied to regular test functions, M. Lewko [8] was able to achieve the
further improved extension results for the 3-D paraboloid (see (1.3) and (1.4)). He also employed
the relation between the Lp → L2 restriction estimate and the Lp → L4 extension result for the
3-D paraboloid.
In this paper, we develop his work to higher dimensional cases. To estimate

kbgkL2(P,dσ), we will invoke not only Lp → L4 extension results but also L2 → Lr extension results

for paraboloids in higher dimensions. The following lemma can be obtained by a modiﬁcation of
the Mockenhaupt and Tao Machinery which explains the relation between the Lp → L2 restriction
estimate and the Lp → L4 extension result for paraboloids.

where δ0(m) = 1 if m = (0, . . . , 0) and 0 otherwise, we can write from H¨older’s inequality that for

3.1. Proof of the statement (1) of Lemma 3.6. Since g is a regular function supported
on the regular set G, it is clear from the deﬁnition of ha that 1
2 ≤ |ha(ξ)| ≤ 1 on supp(ha) and
|supp(ha)| = |supp(ga)| = |Ga| for a ∈ LG. Thus, using the assumption (3.2) with r = 4, the
inequality (3.6) gives the desirable conclusion.

3.2. Proof of the statement (2) of Lemma 3.6. We shall appeal the following L2 − Lr

extension result obtained by A. Lewko and M. Lewko (see Theorem 2 in [10]).

Lemma 3.7. Let P be the paraboloid in (Fd
−1 ∈ Fq is not a square number, then we have

First, let us see basic ideas to deduce our main results. We want to improve Lemma 3.7 which
is the previously best known result on extension problems for paraboloids in higher dimensions. By

|G| is much bigger than q
hand, since |LG| ≤ q, the second part of Lemma 3.6 gives us much better result than (4.1) whenever

d2
|G| is much smaller than q
2d−2 . In particular, when |G| is very small, Lemma 3.5 yields very strong
results. Therefore, our main task is to obtain much better estimate than (4.1) for every set G with
d2
d2
2d−2 +ε for some δ, ε > 0. This will be successfully done by applying Lemma 3.6.
2d−2 −δ ≤ |G| ≤ q

As we shall see, the ﬁrst part and the second part of Lemma 3.6 can be used for small LG and big
LG, respectively.

In practice, we need to ﬁnd a U (|E|) in the conclusion of the ﬁrst part of Lemma 3.6. To do
this, we shall invoke the following additive energy estimates due to Iosevich and Koh (see Lemma
7, Lemma 8, and Remark 4 in [4]).

Lemma 4.1. Let P be the paraboloid in (Fd
(1) If the dimension d ≥ 4 is even and E ⊂ P , then we have

q, dξ). Then the following statements hold:

Λ(E) . min{|E|3, q−1|E|3 + q

2 + q

(2) If d = 4ℓ + 3 for ℓ ∈ N, and −1 ∈ Fq is not a square number, then we have

Λ4(E) . min{|E|3, q−1|E|3 + q

d−3

4 |E|

5

2 + q

d−2

2 |E|2},

where Λ(E) denotes the additive energy deﬁned as in (3.1).

As we shall see, we only need the upper bound of Λ(E) for a restricted range of E ⊂ P.
Considering the dominating value in terms of |E|, the following result is a simple corollary of the
lemma above.

Corollary 4.2. For the paraboloid P ⊂ (Fd

q , dξ), we have the following facts:

(1) If the dimension d ≥ 4 is even and E is any subset of P with q

2 ≤ |E| ≤ q

d+1

2 , we have

Λ(E) . q

We can deduce the following result by applying Corollary 4.2 to the ﬁrst part of Lemma 3.6.

statements are valid:

(1) If the dimension d ≥ 4 is even and q

for a, a′ ∈ LG. Thus, we can choose E ⊂ P such that |E| ∼ |Ha| for all a ∈ LG. It follows that

We are ready to complete the proof of our main theorems, Theorem 1.4 and Theorem 1.5, which

will be proved in the following subsections.

4.1. Proof of Theorem 1.4. By duality and Lemma 3.2, it is enough to prove the following

statement:

Theorem 4.4. If the dimension d ≥ 6 is even, then we have

for every regular function g supported on G ⊂ (Fd

kbgkL2(P,dσ) . kgk

6d+8
3d+10 (Fd

q, dm).
12

Proof. As mentioned in the beginning of this section, it is helpful to work on three kinds of

regular functions g classiﬁed according to the following size of G = supp(g) : for some ε, δ > 0,

(1) 1 ≤ |G| ≤ q

d2
2d−2 −δ

(2) q

d2
2d−2 −δ ≤ |G| ≤ q

d2
2d−2 +ε

(3) q

d2
2d−2 +ε ≤ |G| ≤ qd.

Notice that Lemma 3.2 yields much strong restriction inequality whenever |G| becomes lager. Thus,
Lemma 3.2 is useful for the case (3). Also observe that Lemma 3.5 gives better restriction inequality
for smaller size of G and so it is helpful for the case (1). Thus, choosing big ε and δ yields good
results for the case (1) and the case (3). However, whenever ε and δ become larger, the restriction
estimate will be worse for the case (2). Hence, to deduce desiable results for all cases, we had better
select optimal values of ε and δ. Now, let us see how to ﬁnd the optimal ε and δ. Let ε, δ > 0 which
will be chosen later. Let g be a regular function with its support G such that

then the ﬁrst part of Lemma 4.3 yields

(4.4)

where we use the fact that |LG| ≤ q. Notice that this inequality gives worse restriction results
whenever |G| becomes lager. Thus, comparing this inequality with Lemma 3.3 which gives better
restriction inequality for big size of G, it is desirable to choose a possible large ε > 0 such that

4.2. Proof of Theorem 1.5. Theorem 1.5 can be proved by following the same arguments as
in the proof of Theorem 1.4 but we will need additional work for dealing with a regular set G with
middle size. The second part of Lemma 3.6 will make a crucial role in overcoming the problem.
Now we start proving Theorem 1.5. By duality and Lemma 3.2, it suﬃces to prove the following
statement:

Theorem 4.5. If d = 4ℓ + 3 for ℓ ∈ N, and −1 ∈ Fq is not a square number, then we have
