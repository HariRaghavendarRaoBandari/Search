THE STOKES PHENOMENON FOR CERTAIN PARTIAL

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS WITH MEROMORPHIC

INITIAL DATA

S(cid:32)LAWOMIR MICHALIK AND BO ˙ZENA PODHAJECKA

Abstract. We study the Stokes phenomenon for the solutions of the
1-dimensional complex heat equation and its generalizations with mero-
morphic initial data. We use the theory of Borel summability for the
description of the Stokes lines, the anti-Stokes lines, jumps across the
Stokes lines, and the maximal family of the solutions.

1. Introduction

In recent years the methods of Borel summability have been intensively
used for the study of the asymptotic behavior of solution to non-Kowalevskian
complex partial diﬀerential equations with holomorphic initial data in a
complex neighborhood of the origin. The procedure of summability allows
us to get the actual solution from the formal one. This actual solution is
holomorphic in some sectorial neighborhood of the origin and, moreover, its
asymptotic expansion at the origin is given by the formal solution.

The ﬁrst signiﬁcant result was obtained for the 1-dimensional complex

heat equation

u(0, z) = ϕ(z) ∈ O(D),

where D is a complex neighborhood of the origin, and was presented by
D.A. Lutz, M. Miyake and R. Sch¨afke in [12]. The authors characterized
the Borel summability in a direction θ of the formal solution of the Cauchy
problem (1) in terms of the analytic continuation property of the Cauchy
data ϕ with the appropriate growth condition.

In [19], M. Miyake gave the characterization of the Borel summability
for the solutions of the following Cauchy problem for the non-Kowalevskian
complex partial diﬀerential equations

Another important achievement was given by K. Ichinobe in [9], who
deﬁned an integral representation of the Borel sum of the divergent solution
of (2).

It is worth pointing out that the theory of summability and multisumma-
bility of the formal solutions of PDEs is intensively developed and many
other interesting papers were written by W. Balser [2, 4], W. Balser and M.
Loday-Richaud [5], W. Balser and M. Miyake [6], O. Costin, H. Park and
Y. Takei [8], K. Ichinobe [10, 11], G. (cid:32)Lysik [13], S. Malek [14], S. ¯Ouchi [20],
H. Tahara and H. Yamazawa [22], M. Yoshino [23] and others.

In this paper, we consider equations with meromorphic initial data, whose
formal solutions are summable in all, but ﬁnitely many singular directions.
Hence we get a family of solutions, which we specify using the Stokes lines,
the anti-Stokes lines and jumps across these Stokes lines.
The main focus is on the heat equation (1). First, when the Cauchy data
ϕ has a simple pole at the point z0 ∈ C/{0}, using the 1-sum in a direction d
of (1), we describe the Stokes
phenomenon and the maximal family of solutions. In this way we obtain
the following main result (for the precise formulation see Theorem 5).

We assume that the Cauchy data of (1) is given by ϕ(z) = a

+ ˜ϕ(z) for
some a, z0 ∈ C\{0} and ˜ϕ(z) ∈ O2(C), u1 := uθ for θ ∈ (δ, δ + 2π) mod 4π
and u2 := uθ for θ ∈ (δ + 2π, δ + 4π) mod 4π, where uθ is a solution of (1)
given by (6) and δ := 2 arg z0.
Then {u1, u2} is a maximal family of solutions of (1) on the Riemann
surface of the square root. Moreover, the Stokes lines for the formal solution
ˆu are sets arg t = δ and arg t = δ + 2π, and the anti-Stokes lines for ˆu are
sets arg t = δ ± π

are given respectively by

Finally, in a similar way, we describe the Stokes phenomenon and the

maximal family of solutions for the Cauchy problem (2).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review some of the
standard terminology, facts, and theorems about asymptotic expansions and
k-summability. In Section 3, we introduce the notion of the Stokes lines, the
anti-Stokes lines, and the jumps for k-summable formal power series. Section
4 provides a detailed exposition of the maximal family of actual solutions of
given non-Kowalevskian equation. In the next section, we present and prove
the main results of this paper adding several corollaries as a conclusions from
the Theorem 5. In Section 6, we extend Theorem 5 to the solutions of the

equation (2), which is a generalization of the heat equation (1). The last
section contains ﬁnal remarks.

2. Asymptotic expansions and summability

In this section we recall necessary deﬁnitions, lemmas and theorems about
asymptotic expansions and summability. For more details we refer the
reader to [3].

2.1. Sectors and formal power series. Let us begin with the following
deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 1. A sector S in a direction d with an opening α and radius R
in the universal covering space ˜C of C \ {0} is a set of the form:
S = S(d, α, R) = {z ∈ ˜C : z = reiφ, r ∈ (0, R), φ ∈ (d − α/2, d + α/2)},
where d ∈ R, α > 0 and R ∈ R+.

If R = +∞, then we say that the sector S is unbounded and we will write

S = S(d, α).
Deﬁnition 2. Sector S∗ is called a proper subsector of sector S = S(d, α, R),
if S∗ \ {0} ⊆ S. We will use the notation S∗ ≺ S.

Deﬁnition 3. Let k > 0 and let f be an analytic function in a sector S (we
denote it brieﬂy by f ∈ O(S)). A function f is of exponential growth of order
at most k, if for every subsector S∗ ≺ S there exist constants C1, C2 > 0
such that |f (x)| ≤ C1eC2|x|k for every x ∈ S∗. The set of all such functions
is denoted by Ok(S).
We will use also the notation Ok(C) if f is an entire function of exponen-

tial growth of order at most k.

Let us now deﬁne a formal power series.

Deﬁnition 4. Let us consider a sequence (an)∞

power series.

n=0 of complex numbers. A
n=0 is called a formal

We will denote by C[[t]] the set of all such formal power series.

power series of the form (cid:80)∞
Remark 1. We will also consider formal power series of the form(cid:80)∞
Deﬁnition 5. A formal power series (cid:80)∞

n=0 an(z)tn,
where an(z) ∈ O(Dr) for all n ∈ N0 and Dr = {z ∈ C : |z| < r}. To simplify
the notation we write only D if the radius r is not essential. We will denote
by O(Dr)[[t]] the set of all such formal power series.

n=0 antn is called a formal power
series of Gevrey order s, if there exist A, B > 0 such that |an| ≤ ABn(n!)s
for every n ∈ N0. The set of all such formal power series will be denoted by
C[[t]]s (resp. O(Dr)[[t]]s).

2.2. Asymptotic expansions. In this subsection we restrict our attention
to the Gevrey asymptotics.
Deﬁnition 6. Let S be a given sector in the complex plane and f ∈ O(S).
n=0 antn ∈ C[[t]]s of Gevrey order s (s ∈ R)
is called Gevrey’s asymptotic expansion of order s of the function f in S if
for every S∗ ≺ S there exist A, B > 0 such that for every N ∈ N0 and every
t ∈ S∗

A formal power series ˆf (t) =(cid:80)∞
|f (t) − N(cid:88)

antn| ≤ AB(N !)s|t|N +1.

If this is so, we will use the notation f (t) ∼s

n=0

ˆf (t) in S.

We recall two important theorems about the Gevrey asymptotics.

Theorem 1 (Ritt’s theorem, [3, Proposition 10]). Let ˆx(t) ∈ C[[t]]s, where
s > 0. Let S be a sector of an opening α, where 0 < α ≤ sπ. Then there
exists x(t) ∈ O(S) such that for every t ∈ S

x(t) ∼s ˆx(t) in S.

Theorem 2 (Watson’s lemma [3, Proposition 11]). Let S be a sector of an
opening α such that α > sπ and s > 0. Suppose that x(t) ∈ O(S) satisﬁes
x(t) ∼s 0 in S. Then x(t) ≡ 0 for every t ∈ S.

Roughly speaking Ritt’s theorem ensures that there exists a function for
a given asymptotic expansion in sectors of small opening. Watson’s lemma
ensures that an asymptotic expansion uniquely determines a function in
sectors of big opening.

2.3. k-summability. Now we present a method which is usually used for
(cid:80)∞
the investigation of the formal solutions of PDEs with constant coeﬃcients.
The title procedure consists in the change of a formal power series ˆx(t) =
n=0 antn ∈ C[[t]] into a holomorphic function on some sectorial neighbor-

Now we recall an useful lemma about function Cα:

α =

By the general theory of moment summability (see [3, Section 6.5]) in this
case we can say that ˆx(t) is k-summable in the direction d. Moreover, the
k-sum of ˆx(t) in the direction d is given by

Deﬁnition 7. If ˆx is k-summable in all directions d but (after identiﬁcation
modulo 2π) ﬁnitely many directions d1, . . . , dn then ˆx is called k-summable
and d1, . . . , dn are called singular directions of ˆx.

Remark 5. We can extend the notion of asymptotic expansion and k-summability
to the formal power series ˆu(t, z) ∈ O(Dr)[[t]] in a natural way.

3. The Stokes phenomenon for summable power series

We introduce the concept of the Stokes phenomenon for k-summable for-

the diﬀerence xφ+ − xφ−
Analogously we deﬁne the jump for ˆu across the Stokes line Lφ.
Remark 6. Assume that S is a sector with an opening π/k in a direction φ.
Let f (t), g(t) ∈ O(S) be k-sums of ˆx(t) in directions φ− and φ+ respectively.
It means that f (t) ∼1/k ˆx(t) and g(t) ∼1/k ˆx(t) on S. We write r(t) :=
|f (t) − g(t)| for all t ∈ S. Then r(t) is minimal on the Stokes line Lφ for t
close to zero (i.e. there exists ε > 0 such that for every t ∈ S ∩ Dε we have

4. The maximal family of solutions

In this section we describe the family of actual solutions of given non-
Kowalevskian equation by k-sums of k-summable formal power series solu-
tion. More precisely we consider the Cauchy problem

where P (∂t, ∂z) = ∂m

m with respect to ∂t. Since the principal part of the operator P (∂t, ∂z)
with respect to ∂t is given by ∂m
t , the Cauchy problem (3) has the unique
formal power series solution ˆu ∈ O(D)[[t]]. If we additionally assume that
ˆu is k-summable, then using the procedure of k-summability in nonsingular
directions, we obtain the family of actual solutions of (3) on some sectors
with opening greater than π/k with respect to t. This motivates us to
introduce the following deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 9. Let S be a sector in the universal covering space ˜C. The

Deﬁnition 10. We assume that the unique formal power series solution ˆu
of (3) is k-summable and V is a sector with an opening greater than π/k
q for some q ∈ Q+. We say that {ui}i∈I with
on the Riemann surface of t
ui ∈ O(Vi × D) is a maximal family of solutions of (3) on V × D if the
following conditions hold:
• Vi ⊆ V is a sector with an opening greater than π/k for every i ∈ I.
• {Vi}i∈I is a covering of V .
• ui ∈ O(Vi × D) is an actual solution of (3) for every i ∈ I.
• If Vi ∩ Vj (cid:54)= ∅ then ui (cid:54)≡ uj on (Vi ∩ Vj) × D for every i, j ∈ I, i (cid:54)= j.
• If ˜u ∈ O( ˜V × D) is an actual solution of (3) for some sector ˜V ⊆ V
and ˜u = Sk,d ˆu for some nonsingular direction d, then there exists
i ∈ I such that ˜V ∩ Vi (cid:54)= ∅ and ˜u ≡ ui on ( ˜V ∩ Vi) × D.

Now we are ready to describe the maximal family of solutions of (3)

2k

for i = 1, . . . , n.

Theorem 3. Let ˆu be a k-summable formal power series solution of (3) with
a k-sum in a nonsingular direction d given by ud = Sk,d ˆu. We assume that
there exists q ∈ Q+, which is the smallest positive rational number such that
ud(t, z) = ud(te2qπi, z) for every nonsingular direction d. We also assume
that the set of singular directions of ˆu modulo 2qπ is given by {d1, . . . , dn},
where 0 ≤ d1 < ··· < dn < 2qπ. Then the Stokes lines for ˆu are sets Ldi
and the anti-Stokes lines are sets Ldi± π
If additionally for every i = 1, . . . , n we put ui := Sk,θ ˆu with θ ∈ (di, di+1),
where dn+1 := d1 + 2qπ, then for every suﬃciently small ε > 0 there exists
r > 0 such that ui ∈ O(Vi(ε, r) × D), where
Vi(ε, r) := {t ∈ W : |t| ∈ (0, r), arg t ∈ (di− π
2k

) mod 2qπ}
q . Moreover, {u1, . . . , un} with ui ∈
and W is the Riemann surface of t
O(Vi(ε, r) × D) is a maximal family of solutions of (3) on Wr × D, where
Wr = {t ∈ W : 0 < |t| < r}.
Proof. Immediately by the deﬁnition we conclude that Ldi
is the Stokes
line and Ldi± π
are the anti-Stokes lines. They play an important role
in the description of the maximal family of solutions of (3). To this end
observe that for every suﬃciently small ε > 0 there exists r > 0 such that
Sk,θ ˆu ∈ O(S(θ, π

k − ε, r) × D). Moreover, since by [3, Lemma 10]
Sk,θ1 ˆu = Sk,θ2 ˆu for every θ1, θ2 ∈ (di, di+1),

We will show that {u1, . . . , un} is a maximal family of solutions of (3) on
Wr × D. First, we take such small ε > 0 that the opening of Vi(ε, r) (Vi

covering of Wr.
By Remark 4, ui(t, z) ∼1/k ˆu(t, z) in Vi. Hence by the Gevrey asymptotics

properties [3, Theorems 18–20]

P (∂t, ∂z)ui(t, z) ∼1/k P (∂t, ∂z)ˆu(t, z) = 0

in Vi.

Since the opening of Vi is greater than π
P (∂t, ∂z)ui = 0. Additionally, since

Therefore ui is an actual solution of (3) for i = 1, . . . , n.
Now, let us assume that Vi ∩ Vj (cid:54)= ∅ and ui ≡ uj on (Vi ∩ Vj) × D for
some i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} and i (cid:54)= j. It means that ui and uj are analytically

Vi ∩ Vj (cid:54)= ∅ then ui (cid:54)≡ uj on (Vi ∩ Vj) × D for every i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, i (cid:54)= j.
By the construction of the family {u1, . . . , un}, the last condition in Def-
(cid:3)
inition 10 is also satisﬁed, which completes the proof.
Remark 7. One can treat the maximal family of solutions {ui}i∈I, ui ∈

such that u ∈ O(S(d, π + ¯ε, r) × D).

Now we describe the Stokes phenomenon and the maximal family of so-
lutions in the case when the Cauchy data ϕ has a simple pole at the point
z0 ∈ C \ {0}.

Theorem 5. We assume that the Cauchy data of (4) is given by

(7)

ϕ(z) =

+ ˜ϕ(z)

for some a, z0 ∈ C \ {0}

and

˜ϕ(z) ∈ O2(C).

We also assume that u1 := uθ for θ ∈ (δ, δ + 2π) mod 4π and u2 := uθ for
θ ∈ (δ + 2π, δ + 4π) mod 4π, where uθ is a solution of (4) given by (6) and
δ := 2 arg z0, and Wr = {t ∈ W : 0 < |t| < r}, where W is the Riemann
surface of the square root.
Then for every ε > 0 there exists r > 0 such that ul ∈ O(Vl×D) (l = 1, 2),
where V1 = S(δ + π, 3π − ε, r), V2 = S(δ + 3π, 3π − ε, r), and {u1, u2} is a
maximal family of solutions of (4) on Wr × D.

Hence by Theorem 4, ˆu is 1-summable in a direction θ ∈ R, θ (cid:54)= δ mod 2π

Observe that uθ(t, z) = uθ(te4πi, z) and q = 4 is the smallest positive
integer for which this equality holds. Moreover, the set of singular directions
of ˆu(t, z) modulo 4π is given by δ and δ + 2π. Hence by Theorem 3, {u1, u2}
with ul ∈ O(Vl × D) (l = 1, 2) is a maximal family of solutions of (4).
Moreover, the Stokes lines for ˆu are sets Lδ and Lδ+2π, and the anti-Stokes
lines for ˆu are sets Lδ± π

Now we consider the following cases:

˜r > 0 such that {B(z0, ˜r) ∪ B(−z0, ˜r)} ∩ G = ∅, where B(a, r) = {z ∈ C :
|z − a| < r}. Then we see that for z ∈ D˜r the set B(G, ϕ, z) is empty, and
hence by (8)

uθ2(t, z) − uθ1(t, z) = 0.

We obtain the same result for θ1, θ2 ∈ (δ +2π, δ +4π). Hence the functions
u1 := uθ for θ ∈ (δ, δ + 2π) and u2 := uθ for θ ∈ (δ + 2π, δ + 4π) are well
deﬁned.

Case 2: Let θ1 < δ < θ2. Then there exists ˜r > 0 such that B(z0, ˜r) ⊂ G.

ous one by the substitution ˜u(t, z) := −u(t,−z) or, equivalently, by the
replacement of a by −a in (7).

there exists ˜r > 0 such that {B(z0e

where B(a, r) = {z ∈ C : |z − a| < r}. Then we see that for z ∈ D˜r the set

lines, the anti-Stokes lines and jumps in case when the Cauchy data ϕ of
(11) is given by a meromorphic function (10) with ˜ϕ(z) ∈ O q

7. Final remarks

In the authors opinion, using the methods of W. Balser [4] and S. Michalik
[15], one can extend the crucial results obtained in this work to general
linear partial diﬀerential equations with constant coeﬃcients (3) and with
meromorphic Cauchy data.

Similarly, it seems to be possible to generalize the results of the paper
to moment partial diﬀerential equations introduced by W. Balser and M.
Yoshino [7] and developed by S. Michalik [17]–[18].

We are going to study these problems in the subsequent papers.
