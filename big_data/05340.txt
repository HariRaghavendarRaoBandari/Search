On stable manifolds for fractional diﬀerential

equations in high dimensional spaces

N.D. Cong∗, T.S. Doan†, S. Siegmund‡ and H.T. Tuan§

Abstract

Our aim in this paper is to establish stable manifolds near hyper-
bolic equilibria of fractional diﬀerential equations in arbitrary ﬁnite
dimensional spaces.

Introduction

In recent years, fractional diﬀerential equations have attracted increasing
interest due to the fact that many mathematical problems in science and
engineering can be modeled by fractional diﬀerential equations, see e.g. [8,
9, 17].

One of the biggest challenges in fractional diﬀerential equations is to under-
stand the asymptotic behavior of fractional diﬀerential equations. Although,
there have been some publications on this topic such as stability theory, see
e.g. [7, 15] and [13] for a survey of this topic, linear theory [1, 16], Lya-
punov exponents [11, 2, 4] and linearization theory [12], the development of
a qualitative theory for fractional diﬀerential equations is still in its infancy.
One of the reasons for this fact might be that general nonlinear fractional

diﬀerential equations do not generate semigroups and the well-developed
qualitative theory for dynamical systems cannot be applied directly.

The ﬁrst step towards developing a stable manifold theorem for hyperbolic
equilibria of fractional diﬀerential equations was done in [3]. In that paper,
the authors consider a planar diﬀerential equation having zero as a steady
state and the linear part of the linearization along the zero solution has
one negative and one positive eigenvalue. For this class of systems, an
adequate Lyapunov–Perron operator is constructed and the graph of the
stable manifold is characterized as the ﬁxed point of this operator.

Our aim in this paper is to extend the result in [3] to fractional diﬀeren-
tial equations in an arbitrary ﬁnite dimensional space. The main diﬃculty
arosen in this work is to introduce a suitable Lyapunov–Perron operator and
show the contraction of this operator in an appropriate sense. To overcome
this challenge, we ﬁrst transform the linear part into a matrix which is very
close to the diagonal one. Taking this approximated diagonal matrix as the
linear part of the new system, we can use the variation of constants formula
to deﬁne a Lyapunov–Perron operator. By this indirect way of construction,
the Lyapunov–Perron operator can be estimated and enables us to prove the
existence of the stable manifold.

A. Deshpande and V. Daftardar-Gejji [6] recently published a paper in which
they formulated a stable manifold theorem similar to the one in this paper
and the earlier reference [5]. However, the proof of the stable manifold
theorem in [6] is incorrect and there are serious ﬂaws in their approach to
the problem of stable manifolds of fractional systems which we explain in
detail and by counter-example in this paper.

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we recall some fundamental
results on fractional calculus and fractional diﬀerential equations. Section 3
is devoted to the main result of this paper about stable manifolds for frac-
tional diﬀerential equations in high dimensional spaces. Section 4 is devoted
to a discussion about the work of A. Deshpande and V. Daftardar-Gejji [6]
mentioned above.

To conclude this introductory section, we introduce notation which is used
throughout this paper. Let Rd be endowed with the max norm, i.e. kxk =
max(|x1|, . . . , |xd|) for all x = (x1, . . . , xd)T ∈ Rd. For r > 0, let BRd(0, r) :=
{x ∈ Rd : kxk ≤ r} and for a Lipschitz continuous function f : Rd → Rd, we

deﬁne

ℓf (r) :=

sup

kf (x) − f (y)k

kx − yk

.

x,y∈BRd (0,r)

Let R≥0 denote the set of all nonnegative real numbers and(cid:0)C∞(Rd), k · k∞(cid:1)

denote the space of all continuous functions ξ : R≥0 → Rd such that

kξk∞ := sup
t∈R≥0

kξ(t)k < ∞.

It is well known that(cid:0)C∞(Rd), k · k∞(cid:1) is a Banach space.

2 Preliminaries

2.1 Fractional diferential equations

We start this section by brieﬂy recalling an abstract framework of fractional
calculus and the corresponding fractional diﬀerential equations. We refer
the reader to the books [8, 9] for more details about the theory of fractional
diﬀerential equations.

Let α > 0 and [a, b] ⊂ R. Let f : [a, b] → R be a measurable function
a |f (s)| ds < ∞. Then, the Riemann-Liouville

(x − t)α−1f (t) dt

for x > a,

integral operator of order α is deﬁned by

(I α

such that f ∈ L1([a, b]), i.e.R b
Γ(α)Z x
Γ(α) :=Z ∞

a+f )(x) :=

1

0

a

tα−1 exp(−t) dt,

where the Euler Gamma function Γ : (0, ∞) → R is deﬁned as

see e.g., [8]. The corresponding Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative is
given by

(Dα

a+f )(x) := (DmI m−α

a+ f )(x),

where D = d
dx is the usual derivative and m := ⌈α⌉ is the smallest integer
larger or equal α. On the other hand, the Caputo fractional derivative
a+f of a function f ∈ C m([a, b]), which was introduced by Caputo (see
C Dα
e.g., [8]), is deﬁned by

(C Dα

a+f )(x) := (I m−α

a+ Dmf )(x),

for x > a.

3

The Caputo fractional derivative of a d-dimensional vector function f (t) =
(f1(t), . . . , fd(t))T is deﬁned component-wise as

C Dα

0+fd(t))T.

0+f (t) = (C Dα

0+f1(t), . . . ,C Dα

We refer the reader to [8, Chapters 2 and 3] for a discussion on some ad-
vantages of the Caputo derivative in comparison to the Riemann–Liouville
derivative. In this paper, we consider nonlinear fractional diﬀerential equa-
tions involving the Caputo fractional derivative of the following form

C Dα

0+x(t) = Ax(t) + f (x(t)),

(1)

where α ∈ (0, 1), A ∈ Rd×d and f : Rd → Rd is continuous on Rd. Assume
that for any initial value x ∈ Rd, the initial value problem (4) has a unique
solution denoted by ϕ(·, x) which is deﬁned on the whole interval R≥0. This
is for instance the case if f is globally Lipschitz, see e.g., [10, Theorem 3.1].

For f = 0, system (1) reduces to a linear time-invariant fractional diﬀerential
equation

C Dα

0+x(t) = Ax(t).

(2)

As shown in [1], Eα(tαA)x solves (2) with the initial condition x(0) = x,
where the Mittag-Leﬄer matrix function Eα(A) for a matrix A ∈ Rd×d is
deﬁned as

Eα,β(A) :=

Ak

Γ(αk + β)

∞Xk=0

,

Eα(A) := Eα,1(A),

where β ∈ C.

If the nonlinear term f does not vanish, it is in general impossible to provide
an explicit form of the solution of (1). However, we get a presentation of
solutions for (1) by using the Mittag-Leﬄer matrix function. We refer the
reader to [1, 9, 14] for a proof of this result.

Theorem 1 (Variation of constants formula for fractional diﬀerential equa-
tions). The solution ϕ(·, x) of (1), x(0) = x, satisﬁes for t ∈ R≥0

ϕ(t, x) = Eα(tαA)x +Z t

2.2 Mittag-Leﬄer function

This subsection is devoted to an introduction of the so-called Mittag-Leﬄer
function and its basic properties. Analog to the exponential function fre-
quently used in the investigation of integer-order systems, this function natu-
rally occurs as the solution of fractional diﬀerential equations. For α ∈ (0, 1),
β ∈ C the Mittag-Leﬄer function Eα,β : C → C is deﬁned as

Eα,β(z) :=

zk

Γ(αk + β)

∞Xk=0

,

Eα(z) := Eα,1(z).

For a complex number z we denote by arg(z) its argument, which we deﬁne
to take value in the interval (−π, π], i.e., −π < arg(z) ≤ π for all z ∈ C\{0}.

Lemma 2 (Asymptotic expansion of Mittag-Leﬄer function). Let 0 < α <
1, β ∈ C and a real number µ such that απ

2 < µ < απ.

(i) If |arg(z)| ≤ µ, then for an arbitrary integer p ≥ 1 the following

expansion holds as |z| → ∞

Eα,β(z) =

Proof. See [17, Theorem 1.3, p. 32] and [17, Theorem 1.4, pp. 33–34].

3 Stable manifolds for fractional diﬀerential equa-

tions

Consider nonlinear fractional diﬀerential equations of the following form

C Dα

0+x(t) = Ax(t) + f (x(t)),

(4)

5

where A ∈ Rd×d and f : Rd → Rd is continuous on Rd and Lipschitz
continuous in a neighborhood of the origin satisfying

f (0) = 0 and

lim
r→0

ℓf (r) = 0.

(5)

Note that f fulﬁlls condition (5) provided that f is C 1 in a neighborhood
of the origin with f (0) = 0 and Df (0) = 0. Furthermore, we suppose the
following hyperbolicity assumption on A as follows.

Hyperbolicity: Let {ˆλ1, . . . , ˆλm} be the collection of all distinct (complex)
eigenvalues of A. We say that A satisﬁes the hyperbolicity assumption if

|arg(ˆλi)| 6=

απ
2

for all

i = 1, . . . , m.

(6)

We recall the following deﬁnition of local stable manifold for fractional dif-
ferential equations, cf. [3, Deﬁnition 4].

Deﬁnition 3. Let U ⊆ Rd be an arbitrary neighborhood of 0. The stable
manifold of (4) in U is deﬁned as

W s(U ) :=nx ∈ U : ϕ(t, x) ∈ U for t ∈ R≥0 and lim

t→∞

ϕ(t, x) = 0o.

Before going into the details of the construction of the stable manifold, we
brieﬂy discuss the structure of this section: As in [3], we plan to character-
ize the graph of the stable manifold of (4) by the ﬁxed point of a suitable
Lyapunov–Perron operator. In light of the variation of constants formula
in Theorem 1, we are able to construct a Lyapunov–Perron operator associ-
ated with (4) involving the Mittag-Leﬄer matrix functions Eα(tαA). More
precisely, let A = diag(Au, As), where Au ∈ Rdu×du
are
the unstable and stable part of A, respectively. Then, for each xs ∈ Rds
the Lyapunov–Perron operator LP xs : C∞(Rd) → C∞(Rd) is deﬁned by
LP xs(ξ)(t) = ((LP xs ξ)u(t), (LP xsξ)s(t)) for t ∈ R≥0, where

and As ∈ Rds×ds

(LP xsξ)u(t)

(7)

and to show the contraction property of this operator because the estimates
of the matrix valued-functions Eα(tαA) and Eα,α(tαA) are complicated, see
e.g., [8]. These estimates become much easier when Au and As are diagonal,
see [3]. So, our idea is to transform Au and As to new matrices being close
to diagonal matrices and we use these diagonal matrices as the linear part.
In summary, our construction of a Lyapunov–Perron operator can be done
as follows:

• Step 1: We ﬁrst transform the matrix associated with the linear system
to a new matrix being diﬀerent from a diagonal matrix by a small
nilpotent matrix. The correspondence between the stable manifold of
the original system and the new system is established in Lemma 6.

• Step 2: Interpreting the small nilpotent part constructed in Step 1
as a term of order 2, we obtain a new system whose linear part is of
diagonal form. Using the variation of constants formula, we construct
a Lyapunov-Perron operator of the new system. For such an operator,
a contraction property is proved in Proposition 7.

After showing the contraction of a suitable Lyapunov operator, using an
analogous argument as in [3], we obtain the existence and properties of the
stable manifold of (4):

Theorem 4 (Stable manifold theorem for fractional diﬀerential equations).
There exists r > 0 such that the stable manifold W s(BRd(0, r)) of (4) is
given as the graph of a Lipschitz function g : BRds (0, r) → BRdu (0, r) which
satisﬁes the following properties:

(i) g(0) = 0.

(ii) The map g is Lipschitz continuous.

Transformation of the linear part

Using [18, Theorem 6.37, pp. 146], there exists a nonsingular matrix T ∈
Cd×d transforming A into the Jordan normal form, i.e.

T −1AT = diag(A1, . . . , An),

where for i = 1, . . . , n the block Ai is of the following form

Ai = λi iddi×di + ηi Ndi×di ,

where ηi ∈ {0, 1}, λi ∈ {ˆλ1, . . . , ˆλm}, and the nilpotent matrix Ndi×di is
given by

Let us notice that by this transformation we go from the ﬁeld of real numbers
out to the ﬁeld of complex numbers, and we may remain in the ﬁeld of real
numbers only if all eigenvalues of A are real. For a general real-valued
matrix A we may simply embed R into C, consider A as a complex-valued
matrix and thus get the above Jordan form for A. Alternatively, we may
use a more cumbersome real-valued Jordan form (for discussion of a similar
issue for FDE see also Diethelm [8, pp. 152–153]). For simplicity we use the
embedding method and omit the discussion on how to return back to the
ﬁeld of real numbers. Note also that this kind of technique is well known in
the theory of ordinary diﬀerential equations.

By the hyperbolicity assumption (6) we may order λi, i = 1, . . . , n, in such
a way that there exists an index k ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} with the property that

|arg(λ1)|, . . . , |arg(λk)| <

απ
2

< |arg(λk+1)|, . . . , |arg(λn)|.

Let δ be an arbitrary but ﬁxed positive number. Using the transformation
Pi := diag(1, δ, . . . , δdi−1), we obtain that

P −1

i AiPi = λi iddi×di + δi Ndi×di ,

δi ∈ {0, δ}. Hence, under the transformation y := (T P )−1x system (4)
becomes

C Dα

0+x(t) = diag(J1, . . . , Jn)x(t) + h(x(t)),

(8)

8

where Ji := λiiddi×di for i = 1, . . . , n and the function h is given by

h(x) := diag(δ1Nd1×d1 , . . . , δnNdn×dn)x + (T P )−1f (T P x).

(9)

Remark 5. Note that the map x 7→ diag(δ1Nd1×d1 , . . . , δnNdn×dn)x is a Lip-
schitz continuous function with a Lipschitz constant δ. Thus, by (5) we
have

h(0) = 0,

lim
r→0

ℓh(r) ≤ δ.

Next, we establish the relation between the stable manifold of the new sys-
tem (8) and the stable manifold of the original system (4).

Lemma 6. For any neighborhood U ⊆ Rd of the origin, let W s
the stable manifold of (8) in U . Then,

new(U ) denote

W s(U ) = T P W s

new((T P )−1U ),

where W s(U ) is the stable manifold of (4) in U .

Proof. Let ϕnew(·, x) denote the solution of (8) satisfying ϕnew(0, x) = x.
Then,

ϕ(t, x) := (T P )ϕnew(t, (T P )−1x)

for all (t, x) ∈ R≥0 × Rd

is the solution of (4) satisfying ϕ(0, x) = x. Let U be an arbitrary neigh-
borhood of the origin. Recall that x ∈ W s(U ) if and only if ϕ(t, x) ∈ U for
all t ∈ R≥0 and limt→∞ ϕ(t, x) = 0. Equivalently,

ϕnew(t, (T P )−1x) ∈ (T P )−1(U )

and

lim
t→∞

ϕnew(t, (T P )−1x) = 0,

which is again equivalent to (T P )−1x ∈ W s
W s(U ) = T P W s

new((T P )−1U ) and the proof is complete.

new((T P )−1U ). Consequently,

Construction of an appropriate Lyapunov–Perron operator

According to Lemma 6, the stable manifold of (4) in a neighborhood U can
be represented by the stable manifold in the neighborhood (T P )−1U of (8).
Hence, our focus now is to investigate the stable manifold of (8). Analog to
the approach used in [3], we will construct the graph of the stable manifold
as the ﬁxed point of the corresponding Lyapunov–Perron operator. Before

9

doing this, we discuss some conventions which are used in the remaining
part of this section: The space Rd can be written as Rd = Rd1 × · · · × Rdn or
Rd = Rdu
where du := d1 + · · · + dk and ds := dk+1 + · · · + dn. A vector
x ∈ Rd can be written component-wise as x = (xu, xs) or x = (x1, . . . , xn),
respectively.

× Rds

For any xs = (xk+1, . . . , xn)T ∈ Rds
Txs : C∞(Rd) → C∞(Rd) is deﬁned by

= Rdk+1 × · · · × Rdn, the operator

Txsξ(t) = ((Txs ξ)1(t), . . . , (Txsξ)n(t))T

for t ∈ R≥0,

is called the Lyapunov-Perron operator associated with (8).

An important step towards establishing the stable manifold is to estimate
the Lyapunov–Perron operator. In [3], an estimate on the Lyapunov–Perron
operator for n = 2 and d1 = d2 = 1 was developed. This estimate can be
easily extended to our situation when all matrices Ji are of diagonal form.
Note that a minor change is due to the fact that the eigenvalues λi can
be complex. However, Lemma 2 in Subsection 2.2 provides the asymptotic
behavior of the Mittag-Leﬄer function Eα(z) also in this case. Thus, we
arrive at the following estimate.

Proposition 7. Consider system (8). Then, there exists a constant C(α, λ)

kTxsξ − Txsbξk∞ ≤ C(α, λ) ℓh(max(kξk∞, kbξk∞))kξ −bξk∞.

Consequently, Txs is well-deﬁned and

(11)

So far, we have proved that the Lyapunov–Perron operator is well-deﬁned
and Lipschitz continuous. Note that the Lipschitz constant C(α, λ) is in-
dependent of the constant δ which is hidden in the coeﬃcients of system
3C(α,λ) .
(8). From now on, we choose and ﬁx the constant δ as follows δ :=
The remaining diﬃcult question is now to choose a ball with small radius in
C∞(Rd) such that the restriction of the Lyapunov–Perron operator to this
ball is strictly contractive. A positive answer to this question is given in the
following technical lemma.

Proposition 8. The following statements hold:

Construction and properties of stable manifolds

Before we are able to show Theorem 4, we need the following result about
a one-to-one correspondence between the graph of the stable manifold and
the ﬁxed point of the Lyapunov–Perron operator. In [3] a detailed proof of
this result for planar systems is provided and it is straightforward to extend
this proof to the higher dimensional case.

Proposition 9. For each x = (xu, xs)T ∈ Rd, let ϕnew(·, x) denote the
solution of (8) with the initial condition ϕnew(0, x) = x. Then, the following
statements hold:

(i) If x ∈ W s

new(U ), then ϕnew(·, x) is a ﬁxed point of Txs.

(ii) If ξ(t) = (ξu(t), ξs(t))T is a ﬁxed point of Txs for some xs ∈ Rds
,
then ξ(t) is a solution of (8) with ξs(0) = xs. Furthermore, sup-
pose additionally that kξk∞ ≤ r∗, where r∗ satisﬁes (12). Then,
limt→∞ ξ(t) = 0.

Proof. Analog to [3, Proposition 9].

The existence and properties of the stable manifold of (8) are established in
the following theorem.

Theorem 10. Consider system (8). Let r∗ satisfy (12) and r be deﬁned
as in (13). Then, for any xs ∈ BRds (0, r), there exists a unique w(xs) ∈
BRdu (0, r∗) such that (w(xs), xs) ∈ W s
new(BRd(0, r∗)). Furthermore, the
map w : BRds (0, r) → BRdu (0, r∗) satisﬁes the following properties:

(i) w(0) = 0.

(ii) The map w is Lipschitz continuous. More precisely, for all xs,bxs ∈

BRds (0, r) we have

kw(xs) − w(bxs)k ≤ 3 max

k+1≤i≤n

sup
t≥0

|Eα(λitα)|kxs −bxsk.

Proof. Let xs ∈ BRds (0, r) be arbitrary. Using Proposition 8 and the Con-
traction Mapping Principle, there exists a unique ﬁxed point ξ ∈ BC∞ (0, r∗)
of Txs. This, together with Proposition 9, implies that there exists a unique

12

element xu ∈ BRdu (0, r∗) such that (xu, xs)T ∈ W s
new(BRd(0, r∗)). Deﬁne
w(xs) := xu. To conclude the proof, the rest of this step is devoted to verify
properties (i) and (ii) for the function w. Since 0 is a ﬁxed point of T0, it fol-
lows that (0, 0)T ∈ W s
new(BRd(0, r∗)). Therefore, w(0) = 0 and the assertion

k+1≤i≤n

sup

7 and Proposition 9, we obtain that

Proof of Theorem 4. Using Theorem 10, the stable manifold of (8) can be
represented as the graph of a Lipschitz continuous function. This together
with Lemma 6 implies that the stable manifold of the original system (4) is
also given as the graph of a Lipschitz continuous function. The proof of this
theorem is complete.

4 Discussion of the paper by A. Deshpande and

V. Daftardar-Gejji [6]

In this section, we discuss the paper [6] by A. Deshpande and V. Daftardar-
Gejji. As we stated in the Introduction, A. Deshpande and V. Daftardar-
Gejji [6] formulated a stable manifold theorem [6, Theorem 3], but the proof
they gave is incorrect. To show this, we give an example to illustrate the fact
that the manifold they constructed in the proof of the theorem is not the
stable manifold as they claimed. The example is a simple two-dimensional
system where such a stable manifold is already known to exist, see Cong et
al. [3]. Namely, let us consider the two-dimensional fractional system

C Dα

0+x(t) = Ax(t) + f (x(t)),

x(0) = ˆx ∈ R2,

(14)

of order α ∈ (0, 1), where

A =(cid:18) −2 0

and

f (x1, x2) =(cid:18)

2 (cid:19) .

From here to the end of this section we use the notation Nr(0), Es, Tσ,
πs, πu, B(t) for the system (14) as deﬁned in the paper [6]. According to
A. Deshpande and V. Daftardar-Gejji [6, Proof of Theorem 3, pp. 2448–
2450], one can ﬁnd a local stable manifold of (14) near the origin, denoted
loc(Nr(0)), as follows. For each σ ∈ Nδ(0) ∩ Es one ﬁnds a unique
by W s
solution of (14), say ϕ(·, ˆx) with ϕ(0, ˆx) = ˆx ∈ R2, which is a ﬁxed point
of an operator Tσ such that πs(ˆx) = σ. Let S(σ) = πu(ˆx) then (σ, S(σ)) =
(πs(ˆx), πu(ˆx)) will form a graph over Nδ(0) ∩ Es as σ varies, and this graph
is the stable manifold W s
loc(Nr(0)). We show below that this claim is false
for the system (14).

Indeed, since A is diagonal the stable space Es is easily found to be Es =
{(x, 0)T : x ∈ R}, and the projections πs, πu are projections onto coordinate
axes, and we can identify the images of the projections of a vector with
the coordinates of the vectors. The relation σ = (σ1, σ2)T ∈ Nδ(0) ∩ Es is
equivalent to σ2 = 0 and |σ1| ≤ δ. For one such σ 6= 0 we construct the
operator Tσ and ﬁnd the ﬁxed point ϕ(·, ˆx) of Tσ according to [6]. A claim
of the stable manifold is that the function ϕ(t, ˆx) tends to 0 as t → ∞ as
the authors of [6] tried to prove in Step 2 of the proof of their theorem. For
the system (14) we have

Now, if the function ϕ(t, ˆx) tends to 0 as t → ∞ as claimed by the authors
of [6] the function ϕ2
2(t, ˆx) is bounded, hence by Cong et al. [3,

1(t, ˆx) + ϕ2

what is a contradiction to the claim that ϕ(t, ˆx) tends to 0 as t → ∞.

In our opinion, the ﬂaws of the paper [6] come from the fact that the authors
of [6] used a false representation of the Mittag-Leﬄer function Eα,β(tαJ) as
they claim the following equality (see [6, Lemma 4(2), p. 2440]):

Eα,α(tαJ) = t1−αB(t) + C(t),

(15)

where J is the Jordan block corresponding to a complex number λ with
| arg(λ)| < απ
2440]. To
show that the representation they claimed is not true let us consider a matrix
J as below:

2 , B(t) and C(t) are deﬁned in [6, Lemma 4, p.

here 0 < λ ∈ R, hence | arg(λ)| = 0 < απ

J =(cid:18) λ 1
0 λ (cid:19) ,
Eα,α(tpJ) =(cid:18) Eα,α(λtα)

0

d

2 . Since

dλ Eα,α(λtα)

Eα,α(λtα) (cid:19) ,

by using the integral formula of the Mittag-Leﬄer function Eα,α(λtα) and
the estimates as in Podlubny [17, Theorem 1.3, p. 32], we can write Eα,α(tαJ)
in the form:

1
α λ

1−α

α t1−α exp(λ

 + C(t),

(16)

here C(t) is the same as the matrix C(t) deﬁned in [6, Lemma 4]. On the
other hand, we can now compute the matrix B(t) in [6, Lemma 4] as

B(t) =  1

α exp(λ

this together with (16) imply that

Eα,α(tαJ) 6= t1−αB(t) + C(t).

Thus the claim (15) of [6] is false. This leads to false assertions in Lemma 4(2)
and Lemma 8(2) of [6], which are main tools in the proof of the stable man-
ifold theorem in [6]. Note that if the Jordan block J has higher dimension
then the relation between Eα,α(tαJ), B(t) and C(t) is even more compli-
cated and one cannot expect a simple relation similar to (the false) equality
(15). As a consequence, the approach to the problem of stable manifolds in
A. Deshpande and V. Daftardar-Gejji [6] is not sound.
