Abstract. Anderson localisation is an important phenomenon arising in many areas of physics, and here
we explore it in the context of quantum information devices. Finite dimensional spin chains have been
demonstrated to be important devices for quantum information transport, and in particular can be engi-
neered to allow for “perfect state transfer” (PST). Here we present extensive investigations of disordered
PST spin chains, demonstrating spatial localisation and transport retardation eﬀects, and relate these ef-
fects to conventional Anderson localisation. We provide thresholds for Anderson localisation in these ﬁnite
quantum information systems for both the spatial and the transport domains. Finally, we consider the
eﬀect of disorder on the eigenstate spectrum of our Hamiltonian, where results support our conclusions on
the presence of Anderson localisation.

1 Introduction

Anderson localisation was predicted in 1958 [1], to explain
experimental ﬁndings of anomalously long relaxation of
spins in semiconductors, and then linked to the metal-
insulator transition. Since then, its reach and inﬂuence
has been greatly extended, to many systems and phe-
nomena. Examples include the integer quantum Hall ef-
fect [2], classical waves [3,4], light diﬀusion in gallium ar-
senide or titania powders [5,6], conductance of microwaves
in thick wires [7], ultrasound [8], photonics [9,10], cold
atomic gases [11], and Bose-Einstein condensates [12,13].
Here we focus on one dimensional ﬁnite spin chains,
which have been set up for ’perfect state transfer’ (PST)
[14,15]. In recent years this type of spin chain has ac-
quired growing importance within the ﬁeld of quantum
information processing, as a means of eﬃciently trans-
ferring information [16,17], or for creating and distribut-
ing entanglement [18] within a solid state-based quantum
processor or computer. Such chains represent the “perfect
wire” for quantum data transmission. By tuning the cou-
plings, their ideal transport property can be engineered
to operate independently from their chain length. How-
ever, based on detailed studies of modest length chains it
can be conjectured that long chains would be the most af-
fected by random fabrication defects [19,20,21,22,23,24]
or by slowly varying external ﬁelds. Within this context,

we have investigated the question of if and how random
defects would aﬀect the relevant transmission properties of
PST spin chains, through the appearance of weak localisa-
tion or Anderson localisation. In one dimension, the theory
of Anderson localisation [1] predicts localisation of quan-
tum states under certain conditions. However it should be
noted that in one dimensional ﬁnite systems disorder does
not necessarily imply the complete vanishing of extended
states, as discussed by Pendry in the case of ’necklace’
states [25]. Therefore there are important theoretical mo-
tivations for considering ﬁnite systems, along with the fact
that experimental systems are ﬁnite in extent.

In this work we consider disordered ﬁnite PST spin
chains. Some studies for non-PST spin chains (i.e. with
uniform couplings) have been performed, including the
work by Siber [26] on a single spin chain realization with
very strong disorder. Here we will consider both the trans-
port properties and the spatial localisation of quantum
states in ﬁnite disordered spin chains, engineered for the
important quantum information transport condition of
PST. We investigate both a large range of chain lengths
and ensembles of random disorder. Our results demon-
strate that, due to their properties, PST spin chains may
display, for a given level of disorder and within the same
chain, diﬀerent regimes of transport and localisation be-
haviour (including Anderson localisation). This demon-

2

strates that PST spin chains form an interesting new class
of systems in which to study localisation phenomena.

3 Disorder and Anderson localisation

2 Properties of PST spin chains

The natural dynamics of an N-site spin chain, including
disorder, can be described by a time independent Hamil-
tonian as follows

H =

N

X

i=1

ǫi|1ih1|i +

N −1

X

i=1

Ji,i+1[|1ih0|i ⊗ |0ih1|i+1 +

|0ih1|i ⊗ |1ih0|i+1] (1)

Within spin chains, a single excitation |1ii at site i
is deﬁned as an “up” spin in a system that is otherwise
prepared to have all spins in the “down” |0i state. In a per-
fect PST system the single excitation energies ǫi are inde-
pendent of the site i, with deviations from this condition
being due to disorder, or errors. The coupling strengths
Ji,i+1 between two neighbouring sites i and i + 1 are pre-
engineered as [27,15]

Ji,i+1 = J0pi(N − i).

(2)

In any practical system there will be a maximum spin-
spin coupling strength, independent of the length N and
set by a characteristic value for the particular physical
realisation of the spins. Therefore, to address this practi-
cal constraint, here we keep the maximum coupling value
Jmax constant as N is varied. This coupling Jmax occurs
in the middle of the chain. As a result J0 = 2Jmax/N (J0 =
2Jmax/Np1 − 1/N 2) for even (odd) length chains.

A useful assessment of chain performance is the ﬁdelity
F , corresponding to mapping an initial state |ψinii over a
time t into a desired state |ψf ini, by means of the chain
natural dynamics. This is given by

F = |hψf in|e−iHt/|ψinii|2

(3)

and PST is realised when the evolution is arranged to
achieve F = 1. We use the ﬁdelity of state vectors to
determine the transport quality of information. In this
work we are interested in the behaviour of a single spin
excitation, so we restrict to the single excitation subspace
of the chain. For this case, the time scale for an excitation
to exhibit PST from one end of a chain to the other is
tM = π/2J0. More generally, this is the time for any
chain state to evolve to its mirror image (about the chain
mid-point), so it is also known as mirroring time. In all
cases the full periodicity of the system evolution is given
by tS = 2tM . This mirroring phenomenon arises from the
fact that for the particular coupling condition Eq. (2) the
spin chain can be mapped onto a macroscopic spin, with
the mirroring corresponding to its precession [27,15].

To simulate diagonal disorder, we set ǫi = EJmaxdi, where
di is a random number from a uniform distribution within
0 and 1, and E is a dimensionless parameter that sets
the scale of the disorder. In what follows we will consider
the dynamics of a single excitation, injected either at the
beginning or in the middle of the chain. The excitation
number is preserved by the Hamiltonian (1) even in the
presence of disorder, so the system remains in the single
excitation subspace of the chain. The system state at any
time can thus be written as

|Ψ (t)i =

N

X

i=1

ci(t)|0i1 . . . |1ii . . . |0iN

(4)

in the site basis. For a particular realization of diagonal
disorder, we have solved the time evolution of the system
using both ﬁnite step time integration and direct diagonal-
isation of the full Hamiltonian. For the initial states used
in this work, these methods have been found to agree well.
For ensemble averages over disorder, we have then solved
for a set of size 100 of independent realizations of the dis-
order.

We shall discuss localisation in PST spin chains from
both spatial and transport perspectives. We analyse also
the eﬀect of disorder on the system eigenstates. We begin
with the onset of spatial localisation in PST spin chains,
under the eﬀects of diagonal disorder.

3.1 Spatial localisation

For inﬁnite one dimensional systems with diagonal dis-
order, Anderson localisation implies that any initially lo-
calized state remains so at all times. For example, in a
semi-inﬁnite discrete chain with an excitation started at
the end site 1, the localisation condition can be written as

∞

X

i=1

|ci(t)|2i < ∞ at all times t .

(5)

Similarly, we can express this condition for the excita-

tion started at site n of an inﬁnite chain as

∞

X

i=−∞

|ci(t)|2|i − n| < ∞ at all times t .

(6)

As an example, the semi-inﬁnite case of (5) is satisﬁed
if the site occupation probabilities follow |ci(t)|2 ∼ i−(2+δ)
for all times and positive δ. For ﬁnite-length chains we
will still seek this form of scaling dependence. To be pre-
cise, for an N site chain with occupation probabilities
of pi = αN i−(2+δ), the normalisation factor is αN =
. This gives a critical (δ = 0) normal-

(1−(2N +1)−(1+δ))
2(1−(2N +1)−1) . For the whole range
isation of αN Cr =
of N (100 to 1000) in our study, αN Cr is very close to

2−(1+δ)(1+δ)

and disorder of strength E = 1.0, when the excitation is injected at site 1 (left panel) and N

critical lines given by i−2 (left) [i − (N/2) + 1]−2 (right) are added to both plots (with a normalisation factor 0.5 on the left and
a factor 0.25 on the right due to the double-sided nature of this distribution). These lines give the accepted cut-oﬀ for Anderson
localisation in the limit N → ∞. Identifying everything below the cut-oﬀ as localised, and everything above as not, we conclude
that chains with N about ∼ 500 and above exhibit Anderson localisation for an excitation initially at the chain end, but chains
with the excitation initially centred do not attain this condition for any N in the range investigated.

Eq. (7)), when the excitation is injected at site i = 1 (left panel) and i = N

2 (right panel).

α∞Cr = 0.5, so we can plot one critical probability distri-
bution for comparison with all the numerical simulations
at diﬀerent N values, from 100 to 1000.

In Fig. 1 we present the eﬀective steady state site oc-
cupation probabilities |ci|2 as a function of i for a range of
chain lengths N = 100 to 1000, with E = 1. To attain an
eﬀective steady state, the dynamics is evolved to t = 5tM
when the excitation is injected at site i = 1 (left panel)
and i = N
2 (right panel) at t = 0. Results are then aver-
aged over 100 time steps, from t = 5tM to t = 7tM . A plot
of αCr i−2 is included in both panels, with αCr = α∞Cr in
the left, and αCr = α∞Cr/2 in right panel to account for
the double-sided nature of this distribution. Comparison
with the numerical results shows the range of chains un-
dergoing Anderson localisation according to (5). Anderson
localisation occurs for N >∼ 500 for injection in the ﬁrst

spin, but not for smaller N . Furthermore, no real Ander-
son localisation seems to occur for injection in mid chain
and this range of parameters, as the probability distribu-
tion does not fall oﬀ quickly enough with distance from
the injection site.

Nevertheless, for central excitation injection into a PST
spin chain the steady state probabilities do still fall oﬀ
with distance. Furthermore the distribution is essentially
independent of N for large N , which is to be expected
due to the weak N -dependence of the spin-spin coupling
around the central injection site. In order to more fully
capture this ‘intermediate localisation’ behaviour, we con-
sider some further plots. In Fig. 2 we show n/N , the frac-
tion of the whole chain over which the steady state prob-
ability needs to be summed in order to achieve a total of
0.95, as a function of both disorder strength E and chain

Fig. 2 demonstrates the sharp contrast between the
Anderson localisation regime (E ∼ 1 and N & 500) for
excitation release at i = 1, where the chain fraction is
close to zero, and the partially localised regime for excita-
tion release at i = N/2. This is somewhat counterintuitive,
as Anderson localisation is normally expected to be inde-
pendent of initial conditions. However this expectation is
correct only when uniform systems are considered, where
uniform disorder implies the same local eﬀect on the eigen-
values. When, as in this case, the unperturbed system is
non-uniform, uniform disorder may aﬀect locally the prop-
erties of the system, see also 3.3. This is why for disordered
PST spin chains it is important to explore injection into
locally non equivalent spins. The ﬁrst and middle spin are
the two extremal cases.

Despite this contrast, for excitations released at the
chain centre there is some element of localisation, with the
fraction decreasing substantially with N for E ∼ 1. This
can be further seen in Fig. 3, where examples of the steady
state probability distribution (averaged from t = 5tM to
t = 7tM ) are given for increasing disorder strength E. For
excitation release at the chain end, the onset of Anderson
localisation with increasing E can be clearly seen, with
almost all of the probability contained in the ﬁrst few
sites at E = 1 (bottom panel, left inset). Note that some
remnant of PST behaviour is still visible at E = 0.1, with
a small peak in probability at the opposite end of the
chain to the injection site. This is removed with increasing
E, as localisation sets in (bottom panel, right inset). For
excitation release at the chain centre, there is clearly an
element of localisation, with the probability distribution
increasingly peaking at the release location with increasing
E. For E = 1 this distribution peak has become essentially
independent of N , as shown in Fig. 1.

3.2 Localisation and transfer ﬁdelity

An alternative and complementary perspective from which
to consider Anderson localisation eﬀects is to examine
transport. Our systems of interest without any disorder
are by design ‘perfect wires’, that is chains that transport
an excitation from one end to the other with perfect ﬁ-
delity in a time tM . Furthermore, modest length N chains
with low levels of decoherence (including disorder) exhibit
potentially useful robustness against decoherence [20,21].
The transfer maintains high ﬁdelity in this region, which is
why PST spin chains are considered to be useful elements
for short range quantum communication. Nevertheless, for
larger N values there is seen to be exponential damping
of the transfer ﬁdelity with N , along with Gaussian de-
pendence on the relevant noise amplitude [20,21].

right-hand y-axis)

These previous studies have looked at the transfer ﬁ-
delity at some chosen time, which for example would be
t = tM if the objective is perfect quantum communication
along a chain. However to link such transport studies to
the onset of localisation eﬀects, it is very important to
examine the ﬁdelity over a range of times, since one con-
tribution to ﬁdelity loss could simply be a shift in the time
of an excitation arriving at its destination, rather than a
suppression of the arrival happening at all. It is only the
latter, and not the former, that is indicative of localisa-
tion. To demonstrate suppression of PST consistent with
localisation, we have therefore sought the maximum value
of the state transfer ﬁdelity over a signiﬁcant range of time
spanning a number of durations of tM , and long enough
for steady states to be attained when this is a relevant
aspect of the behaviour.

In Fig. 4 we show detailed results for the maximum
state transfer ﬁdelity attained in a time window of size
4.5tM , as a function of both chain length N and disorder
strength E, for an excitation released at the chain end site
i = 1. The PST behaviour is clearly visible for all N at
zero disorder E = 0, along with the region of high ﬁdelity
for modest N and small E that demonstrates the practical
application regime of PST spin chains for short range com-
munication. However, the plot is dominated by a regime
of vanishingly small ﬁdelity. This is clearly consistent with
previously observed ﬁdelity damping. Given that the plot
is of maximum ﬁdelity over a signiﬁcant time window, this
is also clear evidence for the onset of Anderson localisa-
tion, complementary to the spatial distribution data given
in the previous section.

Further detailed transport data are presented in Fig. 5.
For weak disorder (E = 0.1) the maximum transfer ﬁdelity
occurs for t = tM and falls oﬀ exponentially but weakly
with N (left ordinate axis), demonstrating practical and
usable high ﬁdelities for modest N ∼ 100. For stronger dis-
order E = 1.0 there is rapid (with N ) exponential ﬁdelity

5

decay (right ordinate axis), even for the maximum ﬁdelity
over the time window. This demonstrates the strong sup-
pression of PST for a strength of disorder that enables
Anderson localisation spatially.

3.3 Localisation of the eigenstates

Signatures of localisation are also apparent from the study
of the eigenstates and spectrum of spin chains [22]. In or-
der to study how the diagonal random disorder aﬀects the
eigenstates, |ϕmi, of the system we obtain the occupation
probabilities as function of the site number i, |ci,m|2 =
|hi|ϕmi|2, with a strength disorder set to E = 1.0.

The upper panel of Fig. 6 shows these probabilities for
a single realization. The left (right) inset demonstrates
that the eigenstates which peak at the ﬁrst (last) three
sites of the chain are indeed completely localized within
few sites. This is the expected signature of Anderson lo-
calisation for the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. We fur-
ther support our ﬁndings by considering ¯ρi, the maximum
site occupancy probability over all the eigenstates aver-
aged over 100 realizations (average denoted by a bar in
the r.h.s. of Eq. 8).

ber (bottom panel). Each inset in the top panel shows three
eigenstates which peak on the three initial (left inset), middle
(center inset) and ﬁnal (right inset) sites of the chain. The inset
in the bottom panel shows the diﬀerence between the averaged
maximum probabilities at the ﬁrst six sites for N =1000, 600
and 300 (as labeled).

6

This is presented in the lower panel of Fig. 6: here the
maximum probability of an eigenstate being in the ﬁrst
(last) sites is very close to 1 and increases with the size
of the chain (see inset). We contrast this with the corre-
sponding probability distribution for the unperturbed case
(pink dashed line proﬁle): in this case the probability of
occupying any site in the chain is very small and roughly
uniform all along the chain.

4 Conclusions

In this paper we have investigated the phenomenon of lo-
calisation in one-dimensional PST spin chains. For low
disorder these chains are known to exhibit some robust-
ness in their transport abilities, which is why they are
of interest for quantum information transport. However,
our investigations have shown how transport is suppressed
for medium levels of disorder (E ∼ 1) and as a function
of chain length N , due to the spatial localisation of a
locally injected excitation. Detailed investigations of the
steady state spatial probability distributions for injected
excitations reveal diﬀerent localisation eﬀects for injec-
tion at a chain end and at the centre. We explain such
diﬀerences with the PST coupling scheme of Eq.(2) which
gives diﬀerent site dependence of the spin-spin coupling
for these diﬀerent chain regions. Excitations at the chain
centre demonstrate an element of localisation for disorder
at strength E ∼ 1, whereas excitations at the chain end
exhibit genuine Anderson localisation for this level of dis-
order and chains longer than N ∼ 500. These diﬀerent
regimes of localisation are also reﬂected in the localisa-
tion of the system eigenstates, with eigenstates localised
over few sites at the beginning and end of the chain (An-
derson localisation) for N & 500 and E ∼ 1. Our work
thus provides another interesting physical system that ex-
hibits localisation phenomena. Future work will examine
the potential of controlled disorder in these systems being
used as a tool for manipulating spin chain properties and
behaviour.
