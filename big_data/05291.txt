(Dated: March 18, 2016)

We discuss diﬀerent deﬁnitions of pressure for a system of active spherical particles driven by a
non-thermal coloured noise. We show that mechanical, kinetic and free-energy based approaches
lead to the same result up to ﬁrst order in the non-equilibrium expansion parameter. The ﬁrst
prescription is based on a generalisation of the kinetic mesoscopic virial equation and expresses
the pressure exerted on the walls in terms of the average of the virial of the inter-particle forces.
In the second approach, the pressure and the surface tension are identiﬁed with the volume and
area derivatives, respectively, of the partition function associated with the known stationary non-
equilibrium distribution of the model. The third method is a mechanical approach and is related to
the work necessary to deform the system. The pressure is obtained by comparing the expression of
the work in terms of local stress and strain with the corresponding expression in terms of microscopic
distribution. This is determined from the force balance encoded in the Born-Green-Yvon equation.
Such a method has the advantage of giving a formula for the local pressure tensor and the surface
tension even in inhomogeneous situations. By direct inspection, we show that the three procedures
lead to the same values of the pressure, and give support to the idea that the partition function,
obtained via the uniﬁed coloured noise approximation, is more than a formal property of the system,
but determines the stationary non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the model.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Temperature, density and pressure are important and measurable quantities characterising the macro-state of a
system at equilibrium.
In particular, the pressure is both a mechanical and a thermodynamic property since it
measures the force necessary to conﬁne a system and plays a major role in the equation of state. It can be obtained
in diﬀerent ways: a) mechanically, by measuring the average normal force per unit of surface, that is the rate of
momentum transferred to a surface per unit area, b) by kinetic theory using the Clausius virial theorem or c) by
measuring the isothermal variation of the Helmholtz free energy with respect to the volume available to the system.
The three methods give the same results as far as equilibrium systems are concerned, whereas in the case of non-
equilibrium systems the situation is not so simple and such an equivalence cannot be proved in general since the
third method requires the existence and the knowledge of an oﬀ-equilibrium thermodynamic potential. The issue is of
particular importance, nowadays, when we consider the behavior of active ﬂuids which are forced out of equilibrium
by injecting energy at the individual particle level, in contrast to a driven system where the forcing occurs at the
boundaries of the system1–3. In active ﬂuids, is even delicate to deﬁne a pressure that is not a mechanical pressure and
for instance it has been demonstrated that the pressure measured at a wall is not necessarily the same as the pressure
measured in the bulk of a system4. However, we can show that for a particular active ﬂuid model it is possible to prove
that the three methods give equivalent answers. The virial method5 is particularly useful when one wishes to derive
the pressure from a numerical simulation6,7 or from a mesoscopic description such as the Fokker-Planck equation8.

In thermodynamics, the pressure can be obtained as the negative of the derivative of the Helmholtz free energy,
F , with respect to the volume at constant temperature and number of particles. In equilibrium statistical mechanics
this translates into the analogous volume derivative of the logarithm of the canonical partition function. In stationary
out-of-equilibrium active systems, the existence of F cannot be proved in general. However, the Gaussian colored
noise model in the uniﬁed colored noise approximation (UCNA)9 is a notable exception. For this model, the N-particle
distribution function is known and has a form similar to the Gibbs distribution of an equilibrium system. Thus, in
principle, we can formally deﬁne a partition function as the classical trace of such a distribution and obtain from it a
series of derived quantities, such as a "thermodynamic" pressure. It is then natural to ask: does this object has the
required properties and, more importantly, does it coincide with the mechanical and the virial pressure?

A third route to determine the pressure considers the hydrodynamic equations and under conditions of zero ﬂuxes
and the fact that the divergence of the pressure tensor must satisfy a mechanical balance or hydrostatic equilibrium
condition: it means that the internal stress of the ﬂuid must balance the resultant of the body forces. Such a mechanical
equilibrium condition allows determining the pressure tensor in terms of the microscopic distribution functions.

2

We prove that the three methods lead to the same expression of the pressure if we limit ourselves to the ﬁrst order
in the non-equilibrium parameter τ , i.e. the persistence time of the "self-propulsion". At higher order, however, we
show how this proof cannot be readily extended since the hydrostatic equation involves a matrix inversion which can
be performed only up to the ﬁrst order in the perturbing parameter. On the other hand, the present result seems
to suggest that studying active particles models, close to equilibrium, allows unifying the thermodynamic with the
mechanical approach to pressure.

The goal of the present paper is to derive explicit expressions for the pressure and the surface tension for self-
propelled4,10–13 particles using the Gaussian colored noise model in the UCNA approximation which has been recently
studied by our group14–16. The paper is organised as follows:
in section II we report the main results obtained in
previous papers and necessary for the comprehension of the following developments.
In section III, we apply the
mesoscopic virial equation (MVE) of Falasco et al.8 to derive an expression for the pressure exerted on the walls.
The method employs the Fokker-Planck equation for the distribution function and the asymptotic constancy of some
functions of the coordinates to determine the virial of the force acting on the active ﬂuid. Such an expression for the
pressure is compared in section IV with the derivative of the logarithm of the partition function associated with the
stationary conﬁgurational distribution function. To compute the volume derivative we use a volume scaling method
of the free energy employed in equilibrium statistical mechanics to compute the pressure of an assembly of particles.
The two results are seen to coincide up to ﬁrst order in the non-equilibrium parameter, a fact which is not at all
trivial, being the ﬁrst one a mechanical property and the second a statistical property connected to the existence
of a thermodynamic potential of the system. As a secondary beneﬁt of the stretching method, we obtain a ﬁrst
deﬁnition of the surface tension of the active system. In section V, we proceed further and use the third approach,
originally due to Baus and Lovett, to compute the pressure: it uses the concept of mechanical work associated with
a local deformation of the system to obtain the pressure and the surface tension. By this approach, it is in principle
possible to determine the components of the pressure tensor at every point of the non-uniform ﬂuid by measuring
the work necessary to produce a local deformation. Even in this case, it turns out that the value of the predicted
pressure is the same as those derived by the two previous approaches and regarding the surface tension we obtain an
agreement with the result of section IV. Corroborated by this agreement between the diﬀerent methods we apply the
mechanical method to the calculation of the pressure tensor in an anisotropic case. Finally, in section VI we come
to the conclusions and perspectives. In order to render the reading of the present paper easier, we created several
appendices where the derivations of some mathematical results used in the main text have been reported.

II. MODEL EQUATIONS

In the Gaussian colored noise model we consider the spatial conﬁgurations (r1, . . . , rN ) of a system of overdamped
particles subjected to a velocity dependent frictional force −γv, and to a white Gaussian noise of intensity √Dt and
Gaussian coloured noise, characterized by intensity √Da/τ and relaxation time τ , and enclosed in a bounded region
of volume V under stationary conditions and in the absence of currents are approximately described by the following
probability measure

PN (r1, . . . , rN ) =

(cid:17).

(1)

The distribution (1) is valid under the so-called UCNA approximation and results from replacing the underlying
coloured noise non Markovian dynamics with Markovian dynamics with new and more complicated interactions as
discussed in previous works14,15. The distribution depends on Ts, an eﬀective temperature, resulting from the sum of a
translational temperature Tt = Dtγ and a swim temperature Ta = Daγ, where Dt and Da are two coeﬃcients related
to the translational and rotational diﬀusion, respectively17–19. H is an eﬀective Hamiltonian which is determined
in terms of the actual potential energy Utotal of the system, detailed in the following, and ZN is the normalisation
and can be viewed as a generalisation to the non-equilibrium stationary regime of the partition function. As shown
hereafter, both H and ZN reduce to their equilibrium counterparts when the non-equilibrium parameter τ /γ → 0,
or in non-dimensional form when τ
γσ2 ǫ → 0, where ǫ and σ are typical energy and length scales characterizing the
inter-particle interactions.

In analogy with equilibrium statistical mechanics, we introduce a "thermodynamic" pressure, pt, as:

and discuss its properties and relationship with other deﬁnitions of pressure such as the virial approach where the
pressure is deﬁned as the external action necessary to conﬁne the system to a bounded region or the kinetic theory

We remark that the diagonal elements contain (N − 1) pairwise terms whereas the oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements just
one term. The idea is to show that in the limit of a large number of particles it is possible to neglect the eﬀect
presence of the oﬀ-diagonal elements.

As shown elsewhere (see ref.15) assuming that the oﬀ-diagonal elements of the Γ matrix are negligible the density
distribution ρ(r) satisﬁes an integrodiﬀerential equation similar to the Born-Green-Yvon (BGY) equation of passive

In the present theory the matrices Γ and ˜Γ play a central role because they describe how the mobility of the particles
depends on their environment20,21 and both reduce to the identity matrix when the non-equilibrium parameter
τ /γ → 0.

III. KINETIC APPROACH: MESOSCOPIC VIRIAL EQUATION

In this section, we shall use a method inspired by the recent paper by Falasco et al8, who derived a virial equation
for non-equilibrium systems described by a Fokker-Planck equation. Clausius’s virial theorem follows from the fact

that the average of the derivative of a bounded function is zero. In the speciﬁc case of the UCNA, the result follows
when we consider the derivative of an operator, O such that it satisﬁes the following set of diﬀerential equations:

the sums are over all the particles, with locations denoted by ri, on which act the forces Fi. Since the particles are
bounded by the ﬁnite volume V the time average of the l.h.s. will approach zero and we can write by splitting the
forces into the external, or conﬁning wall forces, and the inter-particle force:

In the last term the forces are separated in two parts: wall and interparticle forces. The forces exerted by the bounding
walls of the container are macroscopically described as external pressure: each element dA of their area exerts a force
−pvdA (the subscript V stands for virial) so that

where the double subscripts indicate second partial derivatives of the potentials with respect to the coordinate rα.
The ﬁrst term in the r.h.s. of (16) contains the ideal gas pressure, TtN/V , stemming from the translational degrees
of freedom, the swim pressure, TaN/V , (recall that Ts = Tt + Ta) due to the rotational degrees of freedom and the
so-called indirect interaction contribution represented by the second and third term in formula (17), which takes into
account the slowing down of active ﬂuids near a boundary or in regions of high density. The indirect interaction
pressure involves the interplay between the rotational degrees of freedom and the interparticle forces and is a non-
equilibrium eﬀect. In fact, in the limit of τ → 0 the quantity (17), reduces to TtN/V , the ideal gas contribution to
the pressure. Expressions for the pressure equivalent to (16) will be derived by two diﬀerent approaches in the next
sections.

IV. STATISTICAL MECHANICAL APPROACH

The mechanical interpretation of the pressure is not the only one: the pressure and the surface tension are also
thermodynamic and statistical observables characterising the macrostate of the system. In this section and in the
related appendices D and E we derive their expressions by diﬀerentiation of the partition function, ZN , with respect
to the volume and area and verify that these derivatives are equal (within the order allowed by the approximations
involved) to the MVE expression. In other words the thermodynamic-like relationship pt = − ∂F
∂V T,N , where F is
deﬁned as F = −Ts ln ZN agrees with pv. As far as the surface tension is concerned the agreement with a method
based on the distribution functions is shown in section V.

A. Statistical pressure

The logarithmic derivative with respect to the volume is performed employing a volume scaling procedure as

illustrated in appendix D with the following result:

(18)

which is the same expression as eq. (16) obtained by using the kinetic method . Moreover, we shall demonstrate that
such a deﬁnition of pressure coincides (up to order τ /γ) with the pressure obtained by the microscopic condition of
hydrostatic equilibrium. Again we can see that the pressure is made up of three contributions: ideal gas and indirect
pressure both contained in the ﬁrst term, as can be seen using eq.(B1), and a direct interparticle interaction pressure
term contained in the last term.

B. Statistical surface tension

Buﬀ obtained a formula for the surface tension of equilibrium systems by generalizing the stretching method of
the previous section22. We prove that the surface tension obtained through the mechanical deﬁnition also satisﬁes
∂A T,N . Performing the derivative of the conﬁgurational
a macroscopic thermodynamic-like relationship γ = −Ts
integral ZN requires taking into account that the limits of the integrals deﬁning ZN depend on the system area, A.

(20)

with R = (X, Y, Z) = (x − x′, y − y′, z − z′). In the last term, we have used the expansion of the matrix Γ up to
order τ /γ to rewrite the formula for the surface tension. We shall prove below in section V B that the surface tension
computed by the stretching method gives the same value as the one computed by using the concept of work necessary
to stretch the interface.

To zeroth order in the parameter τ the Kirkwood-Buﬀ formula23 for the surface tension of a planar interface is
recovered, whereas the second term represents the correction due to the activity and is similar to the surface tension
found by Bialké et al.24. Notice that in a passive ﬂuid the last term vanishes, because the ˜Γ matrix becomes the
identity matrix.

V. DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS APPROACH

We now develop a method that allows computing the pressure tensor and the surface tension in situations where
the ﬂuid can also be inhomogeneous. The starting point is diﬀerent from the one of the previous section which uses

the Fokker-Planck equation to estimate the virial as in eq. (13). We shall use instead the fact that when the system
is perturbed starting from an initial steady non-uniform steady state the work done on the system to produce such a
result can be written in two diﬀerent ways: either in terms of the work done by external forces when the particles are
displaced by an inﬁnitesimal amount with respect to their initial positions or expressing the work necessary to produce
the same deformation ( with respect to the given reference state) in terms of the product of the stress and strain
tensors. Whereas in a uniform simple ﬂuid one needs a single scalar quantity such as the relative volume variation
to measure its deformation, in a non-uniform ﬂuid the deformation with respect to a reference state is measured by
a displacement vector δs(r)25,26. This method is a generalization to active particles of an approach introduced in
the literature of passive ﬂuids by Baus and Lovett. Such a method allows deﬁning the pressure tensor in terms of
microscopic molecular distributions with the help of the information contained in the ﬁrst BGY equation (7).

6

Once we endow the ﬁrst BGY equation with a suitable closure, in practice expressing the higher correlations in
terms of the density proﬁle and of the pair correlation function, it is in principle possible to determine numerically the
density proﬁle. On the other hand, even without a numerical solution of the BGY equation we can make predictions
about the relevant observables of the problem, such as the pressure and the surface tension. In equilibrium systems,
such quantities are measured unambiguously. Hereafter, we present a mechanical derivation of these two quantities
following the method of Baus and Lovett 27,28 , and derive the pressure by computing the work necessary to produce
an inﬁnitesimal compression of the system and the surface tension by computing the work necessary to make an
inﬁnitesimal stretching of its surface.
In the limit τ → 0 both observables become identical to their equilibrium
counterparts.
Following the book Elasticity Theory by Landau-Lifshitz29 ) the relative variation of volume δV /V can be expressed
in terms of the strain δǫαβ = 1
) associated with a local displacement δs(r) of the ﬂuid, such that matter
at r is displaced to a new position r′ = r + δs(r), and the relative volume change30 is: δV
V = ∇ · δs(r). The condition
of mechanical (hydrostatic) equilibrium in the system dictates that the pressure tensor pαβ in the absence of currents
is subjected to the constraint:

pαβ(r) = fα(r).

(21)

where f (r) = ρ(r)F(r) is the external force per unit volume responsible for conﬁning the system in space and is a
body force. We can express the work done on the system when each particle i is displaced by an amount δs(ri) as:

δW = ˆV

drX

α

fα(r)δsα(r) +˛A

tα(r)δsα(r)

(22)

where tα(r) ≡ −pαβ(r)nα(r) is the α component of the stress vector acting on surface of area A of the system at
position, and n(r) the normal to the surface A at r. The second term in the r.h.s represents the work done by the
surface stress and notice that the minus sign is a consequence of our convention of not introducing the stress, but to
use directly the pressure tensor which is minus the stress tensor. Following Landau-Lifshitz let us imagine, now, that
the system is undeformed at inﬁnity and remove at inﬁnity the surface where the integral is performed so that the
second term in the r.h.s of (22) vanishes and only the ﬁrst term remains. On the other hand, the work (22) can also
be expressed in terms of the pressure tensor by using (21) :

δW = ˆV

As a consequence of ¸A dAPα tα(r)δsα(r) = 0, we ﬁnally rewrite the work in terms of the strain and of the pressure

tensor, pαβ.

δW = −ˆV

drX

αβ

pαβ(r)δǫαβ(r)

(24)

In order to obtain an expression for the bulk pressure in a uniform and isotropic system, where pαβ(r) = pV δαβ, we,
now, assume the deformation to be a uniform inﬁnitesimal dilatation δs(r) = λr, corresponding to a relative volume
change δV
V = 3λ, According to (24) the work of deformation is δW = −λ´V drPα pαα(r) = −3λpV V . On the other
hand, by computing the work using the body force we obtain: δW = λ´V d3r ρ(r)F(r) · r, and by equating these last

two expressions we ﬁnd the volume averaged pressure

pV = −

3V ˆV

drρ(r)F (r) · r.

(25)

Finally, with the help of the BGY equation (8) we eliminate ρ(r)F(r), substitute in (25): and express the pressure in
terms of molecular distributions:

Similarly to eq. (16), the ﬁrst term in equation (26), that in the following we shall call "active" for short, is the sum

and is the same as the MVE result of (16) and thus

The work of deformation method, which yields the same result for the pressure of a uniform system as the MVE
approach of section III, will be now applied hereafter to two diﬀerent non-uniform situations: a) an active ﬂuid in the
presence of a ﬂat boundary and b) in the presence of an interface between two phases.

A. Pressure against a planar wall

We represent a wall by means of an external soft-repulsive potential u(r) rapidly decaying away from the wall and
derive the corresponding expression of the pressure tensor. In this case, we consider an anisotropic deformation, δs(r),
aﬀecting only the direction normal to the wall, and to this purpose choose a diﬀerent parametrization. To include the
planar wall we consider a cubic system

and locate the wall at z = 0. The displacement ﬁeld is now represent by δs(r) = (0, 0, λ(z − ¯z)θ(z − ¯z)) and the
associated volume change reads: δV = ´ dr∇ · δs(r) = λLxLy(Lz − ¯z), where z = ¯z denotes a reference plane inside
the system, where f (r) is negligible and non zero only near the boundaries of the system, so that by (21) pzz(r) is
nearly constant for z ≥ ¯z. After the displacement the wall originally at z = Lz is located at z = Lz + λ(Lz − ¯z). The
work done on the system when the volume changes by δV is according to (24):

δW = −λLxLy ˆ Lz

¯z

dzpzz(z)

(30)

We again express f (r) in terms of distribution functions with the help of (8) and compute the work of deformation
using (23)

we get:

(34)

As discussed by Baus and Lovett the meaning of such an equation is that the pressure pzz(¯z) can be measured by
evaluating the ﬁrst term at any plane ¯z inside the system and the interaction contribution due to the direct forces
acting across the ¯z plane so that particles at z and at z′ are on opposite sides of the mathematical surface at ¯z (i.e.
for z > ¯z and z′ < ¯z). An analogous formula has been derived by Solon et al.

B. Surface tension of a planar interface

(36)

(37)

We are, now, interested in deriving a formula for the surface tension of a planar interface normal to the z direction
and separating two diﬀerent phases. The surface tension, γ, is computed from the mechanical deﬁnition of work done
on the system as a consequence of an isothermal change, δA, of the area A of the interface:

δW = −pV δV + γδA

(38)

In order to compute γ, we remark that by symmetry the pressure tensor is diagonal, depends only on the z coordinate
and can be represented by only two functions: the normal component pN (z) = pzz(z) and the tangential component
pT (z) = pxx(z) = pyy(z), which are not equal as in the bulk because the latter includes the tension of the interface.
Given a rectangular cuboid of base area A and height L, we follow a simple argument by Rowlinson and Widom31 to
compute the work necessary to increase by an amount δA the area without changing the box volume: it is the sum
of two contributions, a) the work necessary to keep the volume constant by applying during this process a normal
pressure pN to the stretched interface and b) the tangential work to stretch the interface. Assuming that pN does not
change with z due to the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium, we write:

δW = −pN AδL − δAˆ L/2

−L/2

dzpT (z)

and since the volume variation must be zero, to linear order we have δV = AδL + LδA = 0, we conclude that
δL = −LδA/A and

δW = δAˆ L/2

−L/2

dz[pN − pT (z)],

(39)

and identify γ with the integral in (39). Using the strain-stress formalism we can derive the same result and compute
explicitly the pressure components by considering the work done by the internal forces:

d3r[pN (z)δǫzz + pT (z)δǫxx + pT (z)δǫyy]

δW = −ˆV
3 ˆV
= −

d3r(cid:16)(pN (z) + 2pT (z)) [δǫzz + δǫxx + δǫyy] − (pN (z) − pT (z))[δǫxx + δǫyy − 2δǫzz](cid:17).

(40)

9

The ﬁrst term represents the trace of the pressure tensor and provides average pressure pav(z) = (pN (z) + 2pT (z))/3
of the non-uniform system. Let us now assume a displacement of the form: δs(r) = λ(x, 0,−z) corresponding to an
isochoric process, i.e. ∇ · δs(r) = 0, and to a relative area change δA
A = λ of the surface normal to the z-direction, so
that (40) can be written as:

δW = λˆV

d3r(pN (z) − pT (z)) = δAˆ dz(pN (z) − pT (z)) = γδA.

(41)

We, now, perform the calculations of the work done by the external force ( δW = ´V drf · δs(r)) and equate it to

δW = γδA. We obtain the following expression for the surface tension:

γ =

1

A ˆV

dr[xfx(r) − zfz(r)]

(42)

and proceed to eliminate the components of f in favor of the microscopic distribution functions in (42) using (8). The
resulting expression of the surface tension can be divided in two pieces as γ = γactive + γdirect: the ﬁrst one contains
ideal, swim and indirect contributions and after integrating by parts reads:

γactive =

Taking into account that the ﬁrst integral in the r.h.s. vanishes we obtain:

γactive =

xx (r)]ρ(r).

[δβx ˜Γ−1

xβ (r) − δβz ˜Γ−1

zβ (r)]ρ(r).

(43)

(44)

The second contribution to the surface tension, stemming from direct interactions and represented by the last term
in the r.h.s. of (8), is a standard calculation in equilibrium ﬂuids and results in the following expression:

γdirect =

1

2A ˆ drˆ dr′ρ(2)(r, r′)(cid:16) (x − x′)2 − (z − z′)2

|r − r′|

(cid:17) ∂w(r − r′)

∂r

(45)

By putting together (44) and (45) we see that this prescription for the surface tension gives the same result up to
order τ /γ as formula(20) which was obtained by an isochoric deformation of the system and coordinate rescaling.

In order to evaluate γactive we need the explicit form of the diagonal ˜Γαβ matrix elements:

˜ΓN (T )(z) = 1 +

τ

γ ˆ dr′wzz(xx)(r, r′)ρ(z′)g(r, r′).

(46)

Using (44) and (45) and the second equality in (41) we may identify the active and passive part of the normal and
tangential pressure tensor as:

(cid:16) pactive
N

T

(z)
(z) (cid:17) = Tsρ(z)(cid:16)

|r − r′|

∂w(r − r′)

∂r

(47)

(48)

Notice that the active pressure is higher in the low-density region than in the dense phase because of the mobility

reduction? .

Summing the two expressions we obtain the total surface tension pN (T ) = pactive

N (T ) (z). Notice that the
3 T r pαβ(z) is not constant through the interface, whereas pN (z) must be constant

N (T ) (z) + pdirect

scalar pressure deﬁned as: pav(z) = 1
in order to ensure mechanical equilibrium in the absence of external stabilizing ﬁelds.

To conclude, we have seen that the activity modiﬁes the ideal gas term of the pressure by the presence of the
friction matrix ˜Γαβ(r), besides modifying the density distribution and the pair correlation function. This trend has
been observed by the three methods considered in all the scrutinized quantities, namely the surface tension and the
components of the pressure tensor.

C. Comment about the swim pressure of Solon et al.

In order to make contact with the approach proposed by Solon et al.4,13 we compare our result

(27) with their

expression for the swim pressure which in the present notation reads:

pswim =

ρ
d

τ γv0v(ρ)

where v(ρ) and v0 are the average speeds of a particle along its direction of propulsion with and without interparticle
interactions, respectively. In the interacting case, these authors express the density dependent velocity as v(ρ) =
(v0 + I2/ρ) where I2 is expressed in terms of the pair potential. Separating the swim pressure and identifying
Ta/γ = Da = v2

0τ /d we have

pswim = ρ

Ta
d

τ γv0(v0 + (v(ρ) − v0)) = ρTa +

ρ
d

τ γv0(v(ρ) − v0).

(49)

Such a result can be compared with our expression for the active pressure (27) in the case where, for the sake of
˜Γ−1
simplicity we set Tt = 0 and assume a uniform density so that pactive = Ta
αα. By using a result recently
derived32. we relate the variance of the velocity of the particles in the UCNA model to the inverse friction matrix ˜Γ
according to Pd

˜Γ−1
αα and rewrite the active pressure as:

d Pd

with hv0
(49) and (50), in both appears the
diﬀerence between the eﬀective velocity v and the velocity of an isolated particle, so that in both equations the excess
term vanishes when ρ → 0.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied diﬀerent routes to pressure for a particular model system of active particles. We have focused on
an argument which has recently generated some debate: whether the pressure in active ﬂuids is a state function or
not. By an analysis of models with anisotropic interactions or with quorum sensing, it has been reported that this is
generally not the case4,13. Diﬀerently for our model we have found that, within the limits of our approximations, the
pressure of an assembly of active particles with repulsive spherical interactions is a state function and can be computed
from a partition function and this coincides with other deﬁnitions of pressure obtained from a mechanical perspective.
Very recently, Speck33 using a stochastic thermodynamic approach has derived expressions for the pressure and the
surface tension of active Brownian particles that agree with ours.

Summarizing we have computed the pressure and the surface tension of an active system within the UCNA and
found that the results of diﬀerent methods are in agreement as long as we limit ourselves to ﬁrst order in the
relaxation time of the active noise. Moreover, all the quantities reduce smoothly to their equilibrium values when
this non-equilibrium parameter vanishes. In a forthcoming publication, we shall also show that for a simple model
system of harmonic dumbbells these theoretical predictions are exact and the agreement between diﬀerent methods
is valid to any order. Our results also suggest to compare the pressure obtained numerically in other simple models
of active particles (e.g. in active Brownian and run and tumble particles) and check if the agreement among diﬀerent
deﬁnitions of pressure is preserved when the relaxation time of the noise is small.

N (r1, . . . , rn) = ´ drn+1 . . . drN PN (r1, . . . , rN ) of diﬀerent orders (see ref.15). In particular, one obtains:

Appendix D: Derivative of eﬀective free energy with respect to the enclosing volume

Performing the derivative of the conﬁgurational integral ZN requires taking into account that the limits of the
integrals deﬁning ZN depend on the system volume, V . To properly take the derivative we non-dimensionalize each
particle coordinate by the size of the box, by making the change ri → Lqi, where the −∞ ≤ qiα ≤ ∞. We evaluate the
. and show that up to ﬁrst order in the perturbation parameter τ /γ this quantity coincides

with the mechanical pressure and with the virial pressure. We assume that Utotal includes only pairwise forces and a
conﬁning external potential with the following scaling on the linear size of the system, L:

Utotal = Uint(r1, . . . , rN ) + Uwall(

r1
L

, . . . ,

rN
L

)

(D1)

Uwall is a smooth function becoming inﬁnite when rα → ±∞, in particular if |rα| > L so that the density becomes
exponentially small. The volume dependence of ZN is set by the typical volume V = L3 since the domain of integration
is inﬁnite but L is the typical size of the container. In order to obtain the formula (18) we rescale the coordinates
ri → Lqi.

In analogy with equilibrium statistical mechanics and by dimensional considerations, we have identiﬁed the volume

Proof of the equivalence with the virial pressure: in order to prove that pt has a physical meaning, we must ascertain
whether it agrees with the pressure pV obtained by the virial MVE method. Apparently, the formulas disagree, but
if we consider only the ﬁrst order expansion in the parameter τ /γ of the previous formula the two methods are in
agreement. We start by rewriting

pt =

After recognising that the ﬁrst term is the internal virial, and the last term is the ﬁrst order approximation to the
trace of the inverse matrix Γ, w ﬁnd the result eq. (18) of the main text.

Appendix E: Derivative of eﬀective free energy with respect to the interfacial area

In this case, we shall assume that the system is contained in a box of volume V = Lx× Ly× Lz, with Lx = Ly = √A

and in order to properly take the derivative with respect to the area, while keeping the volume V ﬁxed, we non-
dimensionalize each particle coordinate by the transformation:

(xi, yi, zi) → (√AXi,√AYi,
and assume 0 ≤ (Xi, Yi, Zi) ≤ 1 and rewrite the partition function as

where H now contains only the interparticle potentials and not the external potential which is already accounted for
