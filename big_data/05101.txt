We implement a pseudolikelyhood approach with l2-regularization as well as the recently intro-
duced pseudolikelihood with decimation procedure to the inverse problem in continuous spin models
on arbitrary networks, with arbitrarily disordered couplings. Performances of the approaches are
tested against data produced by Monte Carlo numerical simulations and compared also from previ-
ously studied fully-connected mean-ﬁeld-based inference techniques. The results clearly show that
the best network reconstruction is obtained through the decimation scheme, that also allows to dwell
the inference down to lower temperature regimes. Possible applications to phasor models for light
propagation in random media are proposed and discussed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Given a data set and a model with some unknown pa-
rameters, the inverse problem aims to ﬁnd the values of
the model parameters that best ﬁt the data. In this work,
in which we focus on systems of interacting elements, the
inverse problem concerns the statistical inference of the
underling interaction network and of its coupling coeﬃ-
cients from observed data on the dynamics of the system.
Versions of this problem are encountered in physics, bi-
ology (e.g., [1–3]), social sciences and ﬁnance (e.g.,[4, 5]),
neuroscience (e.g., [6–8]), just to cite a few, and are be-
coming more and more important due to the increase in
the amount of data available from these ﬁelds.

A standard approach used in statistical inference is
to predict the interaction couplings by maximizing the
likelihood function. This technique, however, requires
the evaluation of the partition function that, in the most
general case, concerns a number of computations scaling
exponentially with the system size. Boltzmann machine
learning uses Monte Carlo sampling to compute the gra-
dients of the Log-likelihood looking for stationary points
[9] but this method is computationally manageable only
for small systems. A series of faster approximations,
such as naive mean-ﬁeld, independent-pair approxima-
tion [7, 10], inversion of TAP equations [11, 12], small
correlations expansion [13], adaptive TAP [14], adaptive
cluster expansion [15] or Bethe approximations [16, 17]
have, then, been developed. These techniques take as
input means and correlations of observed variables and
most of them assume a fully connected graph as under-
lying connectivity network, or expand around it by per-
turbative dilution. In most cases, network reconstruction
turns out to be not accurate for small data sizes and/or
when couplings are strong or, else, if the original inter-
action network is sparse.

A further method, substantially improving perfor-
mances for small data, is the so-called Pseudo-Likelyhood

In Ref.

Method (PLM) [18].
[19] Aurell and Ekeberg
performed a comparison between PLM and some of the
just mentioned mean-ﬁeld-based algorithms on the pair-
wise interacting Ising-spin (σ = ±1) model, showing how
PLM performs sensitively better, especially on sparse
graphs and in the high-coupling limit, i.e., for low tem-
perature.

In this work, we aim at performing statistical infer-
ence on a model whose interacting variables are contin-
uous XY spins, i.e., σ ≡ (cos φ, sin φ) with φ ∈ [0, 2π).
The developed tools can, actually, be also straightfor-
ward applied to the p-clock model [20] where the phase
φ takes discretely equispaced p values in the 2π interval,
φa = a2π/p, with a = 0, 1, . . . , p − 1. The p-clock model,
else called vector Potts model, gives a hierarchy of dis-
cretization of the XY model as p increases. For p = 2,
one recovers the Ising model, for p = 4 the Ashkin-Teller
model [21], for p = 6 the ice-type model [22, 23] and
the eight-vertex model [24–26] for p = 8. It turns out
to be very useful also for numerical implementations of
the continuous XY model. Recent analysis on the multi-
body XY model has shown that for a limited number
of discrete phase values (p ∼ 16, 32) the thermodynamic
critical properties of the p → ∞ XY limit are promptly
recovered [27, 28]. Our main motivation to study statis-
tical inference is that these kind of models have recently
turned out to be rather useful in describing the behav-
ior of optical systems, including standard mode-locking
lasers [27, 29–31] and random lasers [28, 32–35]. In par-
ticular, the inverse problem on the pairwise XY model
analyzed here might be of help in recovering images from
light propagated through random media.

This paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we intro-
duce the general model and we discuss its derivation also
as a model for light transmission through random scat-
tering media. In Sec. III we introduce the PLM with l2
regularization and with decimation, two variants of the
PLM respectively introduced in Ref. [36] and [19] for the
inverse Ising problem. Here, we analyze these techniques

for continuous XY spins and we test them on thermalized
data generated by Exchange Monte Carlo numerical sim-
ulations of the original model dynamics. In Sec. IV we
present the results related to the PLM-l2. In Sec. V the
results related to the PLM with decimation are reported
and its performances are compared to the PLM-l2 and to
a variational mean-ﬁeld method analyzed in Ref. [37]. In
Sec. VI, we outline conclusive remarks and perspectives.

II. THE LEADING XY MODEL

The leading model we are considering is deﬁned, for a
system of N angular XY variables, by the Hamiltonian

H = −

(1)

The XY model

is well known in statistical me-
chanics, displaying important physical insights, start-
ing from the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in
two dimensions[38–40] and moving to, e.g., the transition
of liquid helium to its superﬂuid state [41], the roughen-
ing transition of the interface of a crystal in equilibrium
with its vapor [42]. In presence of disorder and frustra-
tion [43, 44] the model has been adopted to describe syn-
chronization problems as the Kuramoto model [45] and
in the theoretical modeling of Josephson junction arrays
[46, 47] and arrays of coupled lasers [48]. Besides several
derivations and implementations of the model in quan-
tum and classical physics, equilibrium or out of equilib-
rium, ordered or fully frustrated systems, Eq. (1), in its
generic form, has found applications also in other ﬁelds.
A rather fascinating example being the behavior of star-
lings ﬂocks [49–53]. Our interest on the XY model re-
sides, though, in optics. Phasor and phase models with
pairwise and multi-body interaction terms can, indeed,
describe the behavior of electromagnetic modes in both
linear and nonlinear optical systems in the analysis of
problems such as light propagation and lasing [29, 54, 55].
As couplings are strongly frustrated, these models turn
out to be especially useful to the study of optical proper-
ties in random media [34, 35], as in the noticeable case of
random lasers [56–58] and they might as well be applied
to linear scattering problems, e.g., propagation of waves
in opaque systems or disordered ﬁbers.

disordered interference pattern typically having low in-
tensity, random phase and almost no resolution, called a
speckle. Nevertheless, in recent years it has been real-
ized that disorder is rather a blessing in disguise [59–61].
Several experiments have made it possible to control the
behavior of light and other optical processes in a given
random disordered medium, by exploiting, e.g., the tools
developed for wavefront shaping to control the propa-
gation of light and to engineer the conﬁnement of light
[62, 63].

k

In a linear dielectric medium, light propagation can be
described through a part of the scattering matrix, the
transmission matrix T, linking the outgoing to the in-
coming ﬁelds. Consider the case in which there are NI
incoming channels and NO outgoing ones; we can indicate
with Ein,out
the input/output electromagnetic ﬁeld pha-
sors of channel k. In the most general case, i.e., without
making any particular assumptions on the ﬁeld polariza-
tions, each light mode and its polarization polarization
state can be represented by means of the 4-dimensional
Stokes vector. Each tki element of T, thus, is a 4 × 4
Müller matrix. If, on the other hand, we know that the
source is polarized and the observation is made on the
same polarization, one can use a scalar model and adopt
Jones calculus [64–66]:

Eout

k =

tkiEin
i

NI

Xi=1

∀ k = 1, . . . , NO

(2)

We recall that the elements of the transmission matrix
are random complex coeﬃcients[65]. For the case of com-
pletely unpolarized modes, we can also use a scalar model
similar to Eq. (2), but whose variables are the intensities
of the outgoing/incoming ﬁelds, rather than the ﬁelds
themselves.
In the following, for simplicity, we will consider Eq. (2)
as our starting point, where Eout
i and tki are all
complex scalars. If Eq. (2) holds for any k, we can write:

A. A propagating wave model

We brieﬂy mention a derivation of the model as a proxy
for the propagation of light through random linear me-
dia. Scattering of light is held responsible to obstruct
our view and make objects opaque. Light rays, once that
they enter the material, only exit after getting scattered
multiple times within the material. In such a disordered
medium, both the direction and the phase of the prop-
agating waves are random. Transmitted light yields a

Observed data are a noisy representation of the true
values of the ﬁelds. Therefore, in inference problems it
is statistically more meaningful to take that noise into
account in a probabilistic way, rather than looking at
the precise solutions of the exact equations (whose pa-
rameters are unknown). To this aim we can introduce
Gaussian distributions whose limit for zero variance are
the Dirac deltas in Eq. (3). Moreover, we move to con-
sider the ensemble of all possible solutions of Eq. (2) at
given T, looking at all conﬁgurations of input ﬁelds. We,
thus, deﬁne the function:

We stress that the integral of Eq. (4) is not exactly a
Gaussian integral.
Indeed, starting from Eq. (3), two
constraints on the electromagnetic ﬁeld intensities must
be taken into account. The space of solutions is de-
limited by the total power P received by system, i.e.,
Sin : {Ein|Pk I in
k = P}, also implying a constraint on
the total amount of energy that is transmitted through
the medium, i. e., Sout : {Eout|Pk I out
k = cP}, where
the attenuation factor c < 1 accounts for total losses. As
we will see more in details in the following, being inter-
ested in inferring the transmission matrix through the
PLM, we can omit to explicitly include these terms in
Eq. (6) since they do not depend on T not adding any
information on the gradients with respect to the elements
of T.

Taking the same number of incoming and outcoming
channels, NI = NO = N/2, and ordering the input ﬁelds
in the ﬁrst N/2 mode indices and the output ﬁelds in
the last N/2 indices, we can drop the “in” and “out”
superscripts and formally write Z as a partition function

Determining the electromagnetic complex amplitude
conﬁgurations that minimize the cost function H, Eq.
(6), means to maximize the overall distribution peaked
around the solutions of the transmission Eqs. (2). As the
variance ∆2 → 0, eventually, the initial set of Eqs. (2)
are recovered. The H function, thus, plays the role of an
Hamiltonian and ∆2 the role of a noise-inducing temper-
ature. The exact numerical problem corresponds to the
zero temperature limit of the statistical mechanical prob-
lem. Working with real data, though, which are noisy,
a ﬁnite “temperature” allows for a better representation
of the ensemble of solutions to the sets of equations of
continuous variables.

Now, we can express every phasor in Eq.

(5) as
Ek = Akeıφk . As a working hypothesis we will consider
the intensities A2
k as either homogeneous or as quenched
with respect to phases. The ﬁrst condition occurs, for
instance, to the input intensities |Ein
k | produced by a
phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) with homoge-
neous illumination [67]. With quenched here we mean,
instead, that the intensity of each mode is the same for
every solution of Eq.
(2) at ﬁxed T. We stress that,
including intensities in the model does not preclude the
inference analysis but it is out of the focus of the present
work and will be considered elsewhere.

If all intensities are uniform in input and in output, this
amount to a constant rescaling for each one of the four
sectors of matrix J in Eq. (8) that will not change the
properties of the matrices. For instance, if the original
transmission matrix is unitary, so it will be the rescaled
one and the matrix U will be diagonal. Otherwise, if
intensities are quenched, i.e., they can be considered as
constants in Eq. (2), they are inhomogeneous with re-
spect to phases. The generic Hamiltonian element will,
therefore, rescale as

E∗
nJnmEm = JnmAnAmeı(φn−φm) → Jnmeı(φn−φm)

and the properties of the original Jnm components are
not conserved in the rescaled one.
In particular, we
have no argument, anymore, to possibly set the rescaled
Unm ∝ δnm. Eventually, we end up with the complex
couplings XY model, whose real-valued Hamiltonian is
written as

With this purpose in mind, in the rest of this section
we implement the working equations for the techniques
used. In order to test our methods, we generate the in-
put data, i.e., the conﬁgurations, by Monte-Carlo simu-
lations of the model. The joint probability distribution

ference notation, in the following we will rescale the cou-
plings by a factor β/2: βJij /2 → Jij. The main idea
of the PLM is to work with the conditional probability

The underlying idea of PLM is that an approximation of
the true parameters of the model is obtained for values
that maximize the functions Li. The speciﬁc maximiza-

tion scheme diﬀerentiates the diﬀerent techniques.

A. PLM with l2 regularization

Especially for the case of sparse graphs, it is useful
to add a regularizer, which prevents the maximization
routine to move towards high values of Jij and hi without
converging. We will adopt an l2 regularization so that the
Pseudolikelihood function (PLF) at site i reads:

ij(cid:1)2
Li = Li − λXi6=j(cid:0)J R

ij(cid:1)2
− λXi6=j(cid:0)J I

(15)

with λ > 0. Note that the values of λ have to be chosen
arbitrarily, but not too large, in order not to overcome
Li. The standard implementation of the PLM consists
in maximizing each Li, for i = 1 . . . N , separately. The
expected values of the couplings are then:

{J ∗

ij}j∈∂i := arg max{Jij } [Li]

(16)

Jij, one from maximization of Li, J (i)
from Lj, say J (j)

In this way, we obtain two estimates for the coupling
ij , and another one
ij . Since the original Hamiltonian of the
XY model is Hermitian, we know that the real part of
the couplings is symmetric while the imaginary part is
skew-symmetric. The ﬁnal estimate for Jij can then be
obtained averaging the two results:

J inferred
ij

=

ij + ¯J (j)
J (i)

ij

(17)

where with ¯J we indicate the complex conjugate. It is
worth noting that the pseudolikelihood Li, Eq. (14), is
characterized by the following properties: (i) the normal-
ization term of Eq.(11) can be computed analytically at
odd with the full likelihood case that in general require a
computational time which scales exponentially with the
size of the systems; (ii) the ℓ2-regularized pseudolikeli-
hood deﬁned in Eq.(15) is strictly concave (i.e. it has a
single maximizer)[18]; (iii) it is consistent, i.e. if M sam-
ples are generated by a model P (φ|J∗) the maximizer
tends to J∗ for M → ∞[68]. Note also that (iii) guaran-
tees that |J (i)
ij | → 0 for M → ∞. In Secs. IV, V
we report the results obtained and we analyze the per-
formances of the PLM having taken the conﬁgurations
from Monte-Carlo simulations of models whose details
are known.

ij − J (j)

B. PLM with decimation

Even though the PLM with l2-regularization allows to
dwell the inference towards the low temperature region
and in the low sampling case with better performances
that mean-ﬁeld methods, in some situations some cou-

plings are overestimated and not at all symmetric. More-
over, in the technique there is the bias of the l2 regular-
izer. Trying to overcome these problems, Decelle and
Ricci-Tersenghi introduced a new method [69], known as
PLM + decimation: the algorithm maximizes the sum of
the Li,

and, then, it recursively set to zero couplings which are
estimated very small. We expect that as long as we are
setting to zero couplings that are unnecessary to ﬁt the
data, there should be not much changing on L. Keeping
on with decimation, a point is reached where L decreases
abruptly indicating that relevant couplings are being dec-
imated and under-ﬁtting is taking place. Let us deﬁne
by x the fraction of non-decimated couplings. To have
a quantitative measure for the halt criterion of the deci-
mation process, a tilted L is deﬁned as,

Lt ≡ L − xLmax − (1 − x)Lmin

(19)

where

• Lmin is the pseudolikelyhood of a model with inde-
pendent variables. In the XY case: Lmin = − ln 2π.

instances of single site coupling recon-
struction for the case of N = 64 XY spins on a 2D lattice with
ordered J (left column) and bimodal distributed J (right col-
umn). Bottom panels: sorted couplings.

At the ﬁrst step, when x = 1, L takes value Lmax and
Lt = 0. On the last step, for an empty graph, i.e., x = 0,
L takes the value Lmin and, hence, again Lt = 0. In the
intermediate steps, during the decimation procedure, as
x is decreasing from 1 to 0, one observes ﬁrstly that Lt in-
creases linearly and, then, it displays an abrupt decrease
indicating that from this point on relevant couplings are
being decimated[69]. In Fig. 1 we give an instance of this
behavior for the 2D short-range XY model with ordered
couplings. We notice that the maximum point of Lt coin-
cides with the minimum point of the reconstruction error,
the latter deﬁned as

errJ ≡sPi<j (J inferred

(20)

We stress that the Lt maximum is obtained ignoring the
underlying graph, while the errJ minimum can be evalu-
ated once the true graph has been reconstructed.

In the next sections we will show the results obtained
on the XY model analyzing the performances of the
two methods and comparing them also with a mean-ﬁeld
method [37].

IV.

INFERRED COUPLINGS WITH PLM-l2

A. XY model with real-valued couplings

In order to obtain the vector of couplings, J inferred

the
function −Li is minimized through the vector of deriva-
tives ∂Li/∂Jij. The process is repeated for all the cou-
plings obtaining then a fully connected adjacency matrix.
The results here presented are obtained with λ = 0.01.
For the minimization we have used the MATLAB routine
minFunc_2012 [70].

ij

To produce the data by means of numerical Monte
Carlo simulations a system with N = 64 spin variables
is considered on a deterministic 2D lattice with peri-
odic boundary conditions. Each spin has then connec-
tivity 4, i.e., we expect to infer an adjacency matrix with
N c = 256 couplings diﬀerent from zero. The dynamics of
the simulated model is based on the Metropolis algorithm
and parallel tempering[71] is used to speed up the ther-
malization of the system. The thermalization is tested
looking at the average energy over logarithmic time win-
dows and the acquisition of independent conﬁgurations
starts only after the system is well thermalized.

FIG. 3. Reconstruction error errJ , cf. Eq. (20), plotted as a
function of temperature (left) for three values of the number
of samples M and as a function M (right) for three values
of temperature in the ordered system, i.e., Jij = 0, 1. The
system size is N = 64.

For the values of the couplings we considered two cases:
an ordered case, indicated in the ﬁgure as J ordered (e.g.,
left column of Fig. 2) where the couplings can take values
Jij = 0, J, with J = 1, and a quenched disordered case,
indicated in the ﬁgures as J disordered (e.g., right column
of Fig. 2) where the couplings can take also negative
values, i.e., Jij = 0, J,−J, with a certain probability.
The results here presented were obtained with bimodal
distributed Js: P (Jij = J) = P (Jij = −J) = 1/2. The
performances of the PLM have shown not to depend on
P (J). We recall that in Sec. III we used the temperature-
rescaled notation, i.e., Jij stands for Jij/T .

inf (black) and the JR

To analyze the performances of the PLM, in Fig. 2 the
inferred couplings, JR
inf, are shown on top of the original
couplings, JR
true. The ﬁrst ﬁgure (from top) in the left
column shows the JR
tru (green) for
a given spin at temperature T /J = 0.7 and number of
samples M = 1024. PLM appears to reconstruct the cor-
rect couplings, though zero couplings are always given a
small inferred non-zero value. In the left column of Fig.
2, both the JR
tru are sorted in decreasing order
and plotted on top of each other. We can clearly see that
JR
inf reproduces the expected step function. Even though
the jump is smeared, the diﬀerence between inferred cou-
plings corresponding to the set of non-zero couplings and
to the set of zero couplings can be clearly appreciated.
Similarly, the plots in the right column of Fig. 2 show
the results obtained for the case with bimodal disordered
couplings, for the same working temperature and number
of samples. In particular, note that the algorithm infers
half positive and half negative couplings, as expected.

As we expect, errJ decreases as M increases. This eﬀect
was observed also with mean-ﬁeld inference techniques
on the same model[37].

To better understand the performances of the algo-
rithms, in Fig. 4 we show several True Positive (TP)
curves obtained for various values of M at three diﬀerent
temperatures T . As M is large and/or temperature is
not too small, we are able to reconstruct correctly all the
couplings present in the system (see bottom plots). The
True Positive curve displays how many times the infer-
ence method ﬁnds a true link of the original network as
a function of the index of the vector of sorted absolute
value of reconstructed couplings J inf
ij . The index n(ij)
represents the related spin couples (ij). The TP curve
is obtained as follows: ﬁrst the values |J inf
ij | are sorted
in descending order and the spin pairs (ij) are ordered
according to the sorting position of |J inf
ij |. Then, a cy-
cle over the ordered set of pairs (ij), indexed by n(ij), is
performed, comparing with the original network coupling
J true
and verifying whether it is zero or not. The true
ij
positive curve is computed as

,0

ij

(21)

ij

n(ij)

TP[n(ij)] =

TP(cid:2)n(ij) − 1(cid:3) (nij − 1) + 1 − δJ true
As far as J true
6= 0, TP= 1. As soon as the true coupling
of a given (ij) couple in the sorted list is zero, the TP
curve departs from one. In our case, where the connectiv-
ity per spin of the original system is c = 4 and there are
N = 64 spins, we know that we will have 256 non-zero
couplings. If the inverse problem is successful, hence, we
expect a steep decrease of the TP curve when nij = 256
is overcome.

In Fig. 4 it is shown that, almost independently of
T /J, the TP score improves as M increases. Results are
plotted for three diﬀerent temperatures, T = 0.4, 1 and
2.2, with increasing number of samples M = 64, 128, 512
and 1024 (clockwise). We can clearly appreciate the im-
provement in temperature if the size of the data-set is
not very large:
for small M , T = 0.4 performs better.
When M is high enough (e.g., M = 1024), instead, the
TP curves do not appear to be strongly inﬂuenced by the
temperature.

In order to analyze the eﬀects of the number of sam-
ples and of the temperature regimes, we plot in Fig. 3
the reconstruction error, Eq. (20), as a function of tem-
perature for three diﬀerent sample sizes M = 64, 128 and
512. The error is seen to sharply rise al low temperature,
incidentally, in the ordered case, for T < Tc ∼ 0.893,
which is the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature
of the 2XY model[72]. However, we can see that if only
M = 64 samples are considered, errJ remains high inde-
pendently on the working temperature. In the right plot
of Fig. 3, errJ is plotted as a function of M for three
diﬀerent working temperatures T /J = 0.4, 0.7 and 1.3.

B. XY model with complex-valued couplings

ij and J I

For the complex XY we have to contemporary infer 2
apart coupling matrices, J R
ij . As before, a system
of N = 64 spins is considered on a 2D lattice. For the
couplings we have considered both ordered and bimodal
disordered cases. In Fig. 5, a single row of the matrix J
(top) and the whole sorted couplings (bottom) are dis-
played for the ordered model (same legend as in Fig. 2)
for the real, J R (left column), and the imaginary part,
J I .

the most likely number of decimated couplings appears
to be quite independent on T with M = 2048 number
of samples.
In Fig. 8 we eventually display the tilted
pseudolikelyhood for a 2D network with complex valued
ordered couplings, where the decimation of the real and
imaginary coupling matrices proceeds in parallel, that is,
when a real coupling is small enough to be decimated its
imaginary part is also decimated, and vice versa. One can
see that though the apart errors for the real and imagi-

V. PLM WITH DECIMATION

For the ordered real-valued XY model we show in Fig.
6, top panel, the outcome on the tilted pseudolikelyhood,
Lt Eq. (19), of the progressive decimation: from a fully
connected lattice down to an empty lattice. The ﬁgure
shows the behaviour of Lt for three diﬀerent data sizes
M . A clear data size dependence of the maximum point
of Lt, signalling the most likely value for decimation, is
shown. For small M the most likely number of couplings
is overestimated and for increasing M it tends to the
true value, as displayed in Fig. 7. In the bottom panel
of Fig. 6 we display instead diﬀerent Lt curves obtained
for three diﬀerent values of T . Even though the values
of Lt decrease with increasing temperature, the value of

Once the most likely network has been identiﬁed
through the decimation procedure, we perform the same
analysis displayed in Fig.
9 for ordered and then
quenched disordered real-valued couplings and in Fig. 10
for complex-valued ordered couplings. In comparison to
the results shown in Sec. IV, the PLM with decimation
leads to rather cleaner results. In Figs. 12 and 11 we
compare the performances of the PLM with decimation in
respect to ones of the PLM with l2-regularization. These
two techniques are also analysed in respect to a mean-
ﬁeld technique previously implemented on the same XY
systems[37].

For what concerns the network of connecting links, in

M = 256 the PLM techniques still reproduce the original
network while the mean-ﬁeld method fails to ﬁnd more
than half of the couplings. When M = 128, the network
is clearly reconstructed only through the PLM with dec-
imation while the PLM with l2 regularization underes-
timates the couplings. Furthermore, we notice that the
PLM method with decimation is able to clearly infer the

it could be considered also in the under-sampling regime

haviour of the reconstruction error. In can be observed
that for all temperatures and for all sample sizes the re-
construction error, errJ, (plotted here in log-scale) ob-
tained with the PLM+decimation is always smaller than
that one obtained with the other techniques. The tem-
perature behaviour of errJ agrees with the one already
observed for Ising spins in [73] and for XY spins in [37]
with a mean-ﬁeld approach: errJ displays a minimum
around T ≃ 1 and then it increases for very lower T ;
however, the error obtained with the PLM with decima-
tion is several times smaller than the error estimated by
the other methods.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

Diﬀerent statistical inference methods have been ap-
plied to the inverse problem of the XY model. After

9

a short review of techniques based on pseudo-likelihood
and their formal generalization to the model we have
tested their performances against data generated by
means of Monte Carlo numerical simulations of known
instances with diluted, sparse, interactions.

The main outcome is that the best performances are
obtained by means of the pseudo-likelihood method com-
bined with decimation. Putting to zero (i.e., decimating)
very weak bonds, this technique turns out to be very pre-
cise for problems whose real underlying interaction net-
work is sparse, i.e., the number of couplings per variable
does not scale with number of variables. The PLM + dec-
imation method is compared to the PLM + regulariza-
tion method, with ℓ2 regularization and to a mean-ﬁeld-
based method. The behavior of the quality of the net-
work reconstruction is analyzed by looking at the overall
sorted couplings and at the single site couplings, compar-
ing them with the real network, and at the true positive
curves in all three approaches. In the PLM +decimation
method, moreover, the identiﬁcation of the number of
decimated bonds at which the tilted pseudo-likelihood is
maximum allows for a precise estimate of the total num-
ber of bonds. Concerning this technique, it is also shown
that the network with the most likely number of bonds is
also the one of least reconstruction error, where not only
the prediction of the presence of a bond is estimated but
also its value.

The behavior of the inference quality in temperature
and in the size of data samples is also investigated, ba-
sically conﬁrming the low T behavior hinted by Nguyen
and Berg [73] for the Ising model.
In temperature, in
particular, the reconstruction error curve displays a min-
imum at a low temperature, close to the critical point
in those cases in which a critical behavior occurs, and a
sharp increase as temperature goes to zero. The decima-
tion method, once again, appears to enhance this min-
imum of the reconstruction error of almost an order of
magnitude with respect to other methods.

The techniques displayed and the results obtained in
this work can be of use in any of the many systems whose
theoretical representation is given by Eq. (1) or Eq. (9),
some of which are recalled in Sec. II. In particular, a pos-
sible application can be the ﬁeld of light waves propaga-
tion through random media and the corresponding prob-
lem of the reconstruction of an object seen through an
opaque medium or a disordered optical ﬁber [59–63, 65–
67].
