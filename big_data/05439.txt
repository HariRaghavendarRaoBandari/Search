(Dated: March 18, 2016)

We present the ﬁrst demonstration of two-photon double ionization of neon using an intense
extreme ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond pulse train (APT) in a photon energy regime where both
direct and sequential mechanisms are allowed. For an APT generated through high-order harmonic
generation (HHG) in argon we achieve a total pulse energy close to 1 µJ, a central energy of 35 eV
and a total bandwidth of ∼ 30 eV. The APT is focused by broadband optics in a neon gas target to
an intensity of 3· 1012 W·cm−2. By tuning the photon energy across the threshold for the sequential
process the double ionization signal can be turned on and oﬀ, indicating that the two-photon double
ionization predominantly occurs through a sequential process. The demonstrated performance opens
up possibilities for future XUV-XUV pump-probe experiments with attosecond temporal resolution
in a photon energy range where it is possible to unravel the dynamics behind direct vs. sequential
double ionization and the associated electron correlation eﬀects.

Double photoionization of atoms or molecules can oc-
cur through the absorption of either a single energetic
photon or several less energetic photons. Single-photon
multiple ionization is typically studied at synchrotron
facilities where the photon energies can be high but
the achievable peak intensities are low. Such experi-
ments have led to an increased understanding of electron-
electron correlation and have also provided an impor-
tant tool to benchmark the theory of fundamental two-
electron systems like He and H2 [1, 2]. At lower photon
energies and high peak intensities, two or more photons
can be used for ionization. In this regime, nonlinear pro-
cesses in atoms and molecules can be studied and pump-
probe experiments become possible. While multi-photon
ionization using ultrashort intense infrared (IR) or visi-
ble laser pulses in the strong-ﬁeld regime has been exten-
sively studied [3], very few studies have been performed
in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and extreme ultraviolet
(XUV) regime where absorption of one or two photons
is suﬃcient to overcome the ionization thresholds [4–6].
Double ionization by absorption of more than one photon
may occur either through a direct process where the pho-
tons are absorbed simultaneously or through a sequential
process where the electrons are removed one at a time
from the atom or ion, as depicted in Fig. 1. For pulse
durations comparable to the time it takes for the system
to relax to the ionic ground state, typically below 1 fs, the
distinction between the two mechanisms becomes mean-
ingless. The development of experimental tools with the
ability to carry out time-resolved measurements at such
short time scales will thus open up an intriguing regime
where charge re-arrangement and electron correlation can
be studied on their natural timescale.

The intensities required to induce multielectron, few-
photon, processes in the VUV or XUV photon energy
regime have so far mainly been available at free elec-
tron lasers (FELs), where the dependence on intensity

and wavelength for multiphoton ionization and the com-
petition between direct and sequential two-photon dou-
ble ionization have been studied [4, 7, 8], with pulse
durations in the 10 to 100 fs regime. During re-
cent years, laser-driven high-order harmonic generation
(HHG) sources with potential to produce pulses in the
attosecond regime have started to reach the intensity
levels needed for studying nonlinear phenomena. How-
ever, to date only a few HHG-based experiments have
been reported where two-photon double ionization in the
XUV regime was studied [9–12], since the approach still
presents a formidable experimental challenge due to the
inherently low conversion eﬃciency of the generation pro-
cess. These studies use xenon as the generation medium
in order to reach suﬃcient XUV intensities, thus limiting
the highest available photon energy to regions where the
direct two-photon double ionization channel dominates,
since three photons are needed to access the sequential
channel.

In this Letter we present the ﬁrst demonstration of
two-photon double ionization of neon using an attosec-
ond pulse train (APT) generated in argon with individ-
ual pulse durations of ≈ 300 as. The APT has a total
pulse energy around 1 µJ and is focused to an inten-
sity of 3 · 1012 W·cm−2. With a central energy of 35 eV
and a total bandwidth of ∼ 30 eV the APT covers the
spectral ranges of both the direct and the sequential two-
photon double ionization channels in neon. When tuning
the photon energy below the threshold for the sequential
channel the double ionization signal disappears, indicat-
ing that the two-photon double ionization predominantly
occurs through a sequential process. In addition, we ex-
perimentally determine the single-photon ionization cross
section for Ne+ and ﬁnd a good agreement with earlier
measurements [4, 13].

Figure 1 shows the possible outcomes when a neon
atom is doubly ionized by two photons either in a di-
rect or in a sequential process as shown in Fig. 1(a)
and (b), respectively. While the direct and the sequen-
tial processes cannot be distinguished by measuring dou-
bly charged ion yields, as they both involve absorption
of two photons and depend quadratically on the inten-
sity, they behave diﬀerently in two ways. First, for the
direct channel the electrons share the total excess en-
ergy continuously and are preferentially emitted “back-
to-back.” [14]. For the sequential channel the electrons
have discrete energies corresponding to the excess energy
in each ionization step since they are removed one at a
time. Despite this, a certain degree of angular correla-
tion, possibly due to the coherent superposition of the
2P3/2 and 2P1/2 states of the Ne+ ion, has been observed
both experimentally and theoretically [8, 15]. Second,
the direct and sequential ionization channels have diﬀer-
ent temporal behavior as the intermediate ionic state in
the sequential channel has a long lifetime. Within low-
est order perturbation theory, for a given photon ﬂux,
F [photons·cm−2·s−1], and pulse duration, τ , the ratio
between the sequential and direct double ionization yields
may be approximated as

where σ(2)
is the two-photon double ionization cross sec-
tion for the direct process and σ(1)
I,II the one-photon single
ionization cross-sections for Ne and Ne+, respectively.
The factor of two in the denominator is due to the time-
ordering of the ionization events in the sequential process.
As shown in equation 1, the branching ratio between
the sequential and the direct process will depend on
the pulse duration. Using measured [13, 16] and calcu-
lated [17] values for the cross sections close to the thresh-
old for two-photon sequential double ionization, Eq. 1
predicts that the yield of the direct process will become

comparable to that of the sequential one at pulse dura-
tions below ∼500 as. Detailed theoretical calculations
indicate that in helium the transition between the two
regimes occurs for pulse durations just below 1 fs [14].
Due to the requirement of attosecond pulse durations,
so far two-photon direct double ionization has only been
observed experimentally for photon energies below the
threshold of the sequential channel,

[4, 9–12].

The principle of the experiment as well as the char-
acteristics of the HHG source are shown in Fig. 2, with
a schematic drawing of the experimental setup in panel
(a). The HHG is driven by a high-power Ti:Sapphire
chirped pulse ampliﬁcation laser which delivers pulses at
a central wavelength of 800 nm with a temporal dura-
tion of 35 fs at 10 Hz repetition rate and with a pulse
energy of up to 80 mJ after compression. The IR pulses,
with a beam diameter of 30 mm, are loosely focused by
a f = 9 m lens into the generation chamber where HHG
takes place in a 6 cm long static gas cell (not shown in
the ﬁgure) [18, 19]. After the HHG a rotatable gold mir-
ror can be used to send the generated XUV pulses to
diﬀerent diagnostic devices. The spectrum, measured by
a ﬂat-ﬁeld grating spectrometer, is shown in Fig. 2(b)
and harmonics from order 15 (23.3 eV) up to order 33
(51.2 eV) can be seen. Based on the properties of the gen-
erating IR pulses, the HHG spectrum and previous APT
measurements performed in our laboratory [20, 21], the

≈ 15 attosecond pulses with estimated individual pulse
durations of ≈ 300 as. The far-ﬁeld XUV beam proﬁle,
measured with a calibrated XUV CCD camera, is shown
in Fig. 2(c). The total energy above 20 eV of the gener-
ated APT in argon was estimated to 0.8 ± 0.3 µJ.

To eliminate the IR ﬁeld before the experiment we use
two grazing incidence silica plates, anti-reﬂection coated
for the IR, together with a 200 nm thick Al-ﬁlter. The
XUV pulses are then focused using two toroidal mirrors
with a total focal length of 17 cm. The two mirrors, ar-
ranged in a Wolter conﬁguration to minimize coma aber-
ration [22], are gold coated and designed for a grazing
angle of 15◦ which allows for a theoretical reﬂectivity of
46% after two reﬂections for the full bandwidth of the
APT. By taking into account the transmission of all ele-
ments of the beamline, we estimate a total APT energy
in focus of 40 nJ for generation in argon. In Fig. 2(d) the
calculated energy per harmonic on target is shown.

The focal spot is characterized by positioning a
Ce:YAG scintillation crystal in the focus and imaging
its surface using a long working distance optical micro-
scope. The measured spot is shown in Fig. 2(e).
It is
slightly elliptical with 11 µm x 16 µm FWHM. This is
2-3 times larger than predicted by the raytracing simu-
lations, which we attribute to the remaining aberrations
manifested in the elliptical shape of the focal spot. Us-
ing a pulse energy of 40 nJ in the focus and assuming an
APT with 15 pulses with an individual duration of 300
as, we estimate the APT peak intensity in the focus to
3 · 1012 W·cm−2.

To perform the non-linear ionization experiment, the
Ce:YAG crystal was replaced with an ion time-of-ﬂight
(TOF) spectrometer and a pulsed neon gas jet. The TOF
spectrometer was operated in Wiley-McLaren conditions,
allowing for good time-focusing over a large interaction
volume [23]. Two micro-channel plates followed by a
phosphor screen were used to detect the ions. A mass
spectrum from neon is shown in Fig. 3(a). Apart from
the neon ionic species, the spectrum contains a few peaks
due to residual gas and water contamination of the gas
line. At m/q = 20 a.m.u., the main Ne+ peak is vis-
ible, although heavily saturated in the plot. The peak
at m/q = 10 a.m.u. corresponds to the doubly charged
neon ion Ne2+ with a ratio between the yields of Ne2+
and Ne+ of 0.35%. For double ionization of neon with a
single photon, photon energies larger than 62.5 eV are re-
quired, which are not available in the experimental spec-
trum [see Fig. 2(b)]. This implies that the observed dou-
ble ionization involves the absorption of more than one
photon.

To conﬁrm this we studied the non-linearity of the
Ne2+ yield as a function of the APT intensity. The XUV
ﬂux was adjusted by changing the gas pressure in the
HHG gas cell, which had no major eﬀect on the spectrum
of the APT. To monitor the APT intensity we used the

photoionization yield of H2O+. Since the ionization po-
tential of H2O is 12.6 eV [24], all photon energies within
the experimental spectrum are able to photoionize it with
a single photon and the measured yield of singly charged
water ions is therefore proportional to the APT intensity.
The result is shown in Fig. 3(b) in a double logarithmic
plot. A linear ﬁt to the data retrieves a slope of 1.8, close
to the expected slope of 2 for a two-photon process.

The on-target APT spectrum generated in Ar includes
harmonics from 15 to 33, covering the whole spectral
range from 20 to 50 eV [see Fig. 2(d)], and thus both
direct and sequential two-photon double ionization are
possible. The APT intensity dependence of the Ne2+
yield is quadratic for both processes and cannot be used
to diﬀerentiate them. To identify the dominant ioniza-
tion pathway, we generated APTs in krypton and varied
the cut-oﬀ energy across the threshold for the sequential
channel (40.9 eV) while maintaining an approximately
constant APT energy on target (≈ 1 nJ). The use of Kr
rather than Ar was motivated by the presence of a Cooper
minimum in the Ar spectrum above the direct-sequential

Using the measured energies per harmonic pulse from

good agreement with earlier experimental results mea-
sured at synchrotrons (6 ± 1 · 10−18 cm2) [13] and FELs
(7 ± 1 · 10−18 cm2) [4], further supporting the conclusion
that the sequential channel dominates.

In conclusion we have demonstrated, for the ﬁrst time,
two-photon double ionization of neon using an APT
generated in argon with individual pulse durations of
∼300 as, a central energy of 35 eV and a total band-
width of ∼30 eV covering the spectral ranges of both the
direct and the sequential double two-photon ionization
channels. By generating APTs in krypton, we were able
to tune the photon energy over the threshold of the se-
quential channel and could conclude that, in agreement
with the estimation using a simple theoretical model, de-
spite the attosecond pulse structure of the APT, the two-
photon double ionization predominantely occurs through
a sequential process. Finally, from the ratio of the mea-
sured ion yields we determine the single photon ioniza-
tion cross section for Ne+ in good agreement with earlier
measurements.

Our experimental setup allows us to make use of the
full bandwidth of the XUV radiation through the use of
grazing incident optics for focusing and ﬁltering of the IR,
imposing no lower limit on the achievable pulse duration
in terms of the available bandwidth. The demonstrated
performance opens up possibilities for future XUV-XUV
pump-probe experiments with attosecond temporal res-
olution, with a potential to unravel e.g. the dynamics
behind direct vs. sequential double ionization and associ-
ated electron correlation eﬀects [14, 25]. Further, pump-
probe experiments with attosecond time resolution are
expected to be a useful tool for studies of charge migra-
tion in molecules, where recent theoretical [26–28] and
experimental [29] results have indicated the existence of
dynamics on an attosecond timescale.

threshold, making diﬃcult to identify the “true” cutoﬀ
energy. The position of the cutoﬀ, which is a highly non-
linear function of the IR laser intensity, was changed by
varying the laser energy focused in the generation cell.
The APT pulse energy was kept constant by adjusting
the pressure in an absorption cell ﬁlled with argon intro-
duced in the beamline after HHG. The optimization of
HHG for best cutoﬀ tunability resulted in lower energy
per harmonic on target than in Ar [compare Fig. 2(d) and
Fig. 4(a)]. In order to obtain a suﬃciently good signal-
to-noise ratio, an ion-counting technique was applied to
the single shot TOF traces around the expected time of
ﬂight for Ne2+. Figure 4(b) shows the extracted ion count
rates for a cut-oﬀ below (blue bars) and above (red bars)
40.9 eV. The Ne2+ is only visible above the noise for the
high-energy cut-oﬀ, indicating that the sequential chan-
nel is the dominant one in the current experiment. Using
Eq. 1 and an equivalent pulse duration of τ = 4.5 fs by
assuming 15 attosecond pulses, each with an individual
duration of 300 as, we obtain a ratio of more than 20:1 be-
tween the expected ionization rates of the sequential and
the direct channel, strengthening the conclusion that the
sequential channel dominates, in agreement with the re-
sults of more sophisticated theoretical modeling [14, 25].
We now return to the results shown in Fig. 3 and the
measured ratio of 0.35% between the yields of Ne2+ and
Ne+. Using rate equations and assuming a sequential
process, this ratio can be approximated as
