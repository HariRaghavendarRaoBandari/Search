Typical fast thermalization processes in closed many-body systems

Fakult¨at f¨ur Physik, Universit¨at Bielefeld, 33615 Bielefeld, Germany

Peter Reimann

Lack of knowledge about the detailed many-particle motion on the microscopic scale is a key
issue in any theoretical description of a macroscopic experiment. For systems at or close to thermal
equilibrium, statistical mechanics provides a very successful general framework to cope with this
problem. Far from equilibrium, only very few quantitative and comparably universal results are
known. Here, a new quantum mechanical prediction of this type is derived and veriﬁed against
various experimental and numerical data from the literature. It quantitatively describes the entire
temporal relaxation towards thermal equilibrium for a large class (in a mathematically precisely de-
ﬁned sense) of closed many-body systems, whose initial state may be arbitrarily far from equilibrium.

In a macroscopic object, which is spatially conﬁned
and unperturbed by the rest of the world, every sin-
gle atom exhibits an essentially unpredictable, chaotic
motion ad inﬁnitum, yet the system as a whole seems
to approach in a predictable and often relatively sim-
ple manner some steady equilibrium state. Paradig-
matic examples are compound systems, parts of which
are initially hotter than others, or a simple gas in a box,
streaming through a little hole into an empty second box.
While such equilibration and thermalization phenomena
are omnipresent in daily life and extensively observed in
experiments, they entail some very challenging funda-
mental questions: Why are the macroscopic phenomena
reproducible though the microscopic details are irrepro-
ducible in any real experiment? How can the irreversible
tendency towards macroscopic equilibrium be reconciled
with the basic laws of physics, implying a perpetual and
essentially reversible motion on the microscopic level?

Such fundamental issues are widely considered as still
not satisfactorily understood [1–6]. Within the realm of
classical mechanics, they go back to Maxwell, Boltzmann,
and many others [7]. Their quantum mechanical treat-
ment was initiated by von Neumann [8] and is presently
attracting renewed interest [9–12], e.g., in the context of
imitating thermal equilibrium by single pure states due
to such fascinating phenomena as concentration of mea-
sure [2, 13, 14], canonical typicality [3, 15–18], or eigen-
state thermalization [4, 19–26]. Numerically, scrutiniz-
ing ultracold atom experiments [27–30] and unraveling
the relations between thermalization, integrability, and
many-body localization are among the current key issues
[4, 31–37]. Analytically, essential equilibration and ther-
malization properties of closed many-body systems or of
subsystems thereof were deduced from ﬁrst principles un-
der increasingly weak assumptions about the initial dise-
quilibrium, the system Hamiltonian, and the observables
[1, 8–12, 38–45].
In particular, groundbreaking results
regarding pertinent relaxation time scales have been ob-
tained in [45–51]. Of foremost relevance for our present
study is the work of the Bristol collaboration [49], show-
ing, among others, that all two-outcome measurements,
where one of the projectors is of low rank, equilibrate
as fast as they possibly can without violating the time-

energy uncertainty relation. A second recent key result is
due to Goldstein, Hara, and Tasaki [50, 51], demonstrat-
ing that most systems closely approach an overwhelm-
ingly large, so-called equilibrium Hilbert-subspace on the
extremely short Boltzmann time scale tB := h/kBT . A
more detailed account of pertinent previous works is pro-
vided as Supplementary Note 1.

Here, we will further extend these ﬁndings in two essen-
tial respects: Instead of upper bounds for some suitably
deﬁned characteristic time scale, as in [49–51], the entire
temporal relaxation will be approximated in the form of
an equality. As an even more decisive generalization of
[49–51], we will admit largely arbitrary observables. Fi-
nally, and actually for the ﬁrst time within the realm of
the above mentioned analytical approaches [1, 8–12, 38–
51], we will compare our predictions with various exper-
imental as well as numerical data from the literature.
In fact, most of those data have not been quantitatively
explained by any other analytical theory before. Adopt-
ing a “typicality approach” similar in spirit to random
matrix theory [9–12], our result covers the vast majority
(in a suitably deﬁned mathematical sense) of initial con-
ditions, observables, and system Hamiltonians. On the
other hand, many commonly considered observables and
initial conditions actually seem to be rather special in
that they are close to or governed by a hidden conserved
quantity and therefore thermalize “untypically slowly”.

RESULTS

Setup

Employing textbook quantum mechanics, we consider
time-independent Hamiltonians H with eigenvalues En
and eigenvectors |ni on a Hilbert space H of
large
(but ﬁnite) dimensionality D ≫ 1. As usual, system
states (pure or mixed) are described by density opera-
tors ρ : H → H and observables by Hermitian opera-
tors A : H → H with matrix elements ρmn := hm|ρ|ni
and Amn := hm|A|ni, respectively. Expectation values
are given by hAiρ := Tr{ρA} and the time evolution by

ρ(t) = Utρ(0)U †

t with propagator Ut := e−iHt/, yielding

and that for any m 6= n

hAiρ(t) =

(1)

The main examples are closed many-body systems
with a macroscopically well deﬁned energy, i.e., all rel-
evant eigenvalues E1,...,ED are contained in some mi-
crocanonical energy window [E − ∆E, E], where ∆E is
small on the macroscopic but large on the microscopic
scale. For systems with f ≫ 1 degrees of freedom, D is
then exponentially large in f [9, 41]. Accordingly, the
relevant Hilbert space H is spanned by the eigenvectors
{|ni}D
n=1 and is sometimes also named energy shell or
active Hilbert space, see, e.g., Refs.
[8–12] and Supple-
mentary Note 2 for more details.

Analytical results

Our main players are the three Hermitian operators H
(Hamiltonian), A (observable), and ρ(0) (initial state),
each with its own eigenvalues (spectrum) and eigenvec-
tors (basis of H).
In the following, the three spectra
will be considered as arbitrary but ﬁxed, while the eigen-
bases will be randomly varied relatively to each other.
More precisely, all unitary transformations U : H → H
between the eigenbases of H and A are considered as
equally likely (Haar distributed [8–11]), while the basis of
ρ(0) relatively to that of A is arbitrary but ﬁxed. (Equiv-
alently, we could let “rotate” H relatively to ρ(0) while
keeping A ﬁxed relatively to ρ(0)). In particular, the ini-
tial expectation value hAiρ(0) can be chosen arbitrary but
then remains ﬁxed (U -independent). It is only for times
t > 0 that the randomness of the unitary U also random-
izes (via H) the further temporal evolution of ρ(t) and
thus of hAiρ(t).

The basic idea behind this randomization of U is akin
to random matrix theory [9–12], namely to derive an ap-
proximation for hAiρ(t) which applies to the overwhelm-
ing majority of all those randomly sampled U ’s, hence
it typically should apply also to the particular (non-
random) U of the actual system of interest. A more
detailed justiﬁcation of this “typicality approach” will
be provided in section “Typicality of thermalization”.

Since Amn refers to the basis of H, these matrix ele-
ments depend on U , and likewise for ρmn(0) (the explicit
formulae are provided in “Methods: Basic matrices”).
Indicating averages over U by the symbol [· · ·]U and
exploiting that all basis transformations U are equally
likely, it follows for symmetry reasons that [ρnn(0)Ann]U
must be independent of n. Likewise, [ρmn(0)Anm]U must
be independent of m and n for all m 6= n. We thus can
conclude that for any n

Deﬁning the auxiliary density operator ω via the matrix
elements ωmn := δmnρnn(0), equation (2) can be rewrit-
ten as [Tr{ωA}]U . Working in a reference frame where
only H (and thus ω) changes with U , but not A and ρ(0),
implies [Tr{ωA}]U = Tr{[ω]U A}. With ρav := [ω]U it
follows that

[ρnn(0)Ann]U = Tr{ρavA}/D = hAiρav /D

for arbitrary n. Likewise, equation (3) yields

[ρmn(0)Anm]U =

hAiρ(0) − hAiρav

for arbitrary m 6= n.

Upon separately averaging in equation (1) the sum-
mands with m = n and those with m 6= n over U , and
then exploiting equations (4) and (5) one readily ﬁnds
that

The following results can be derived in principle along
similar lines (symmetry arguments being one key ingre-
dient), but since the actual details are quite tedious, they
are postponed to “Methods”. As a ﬁrst result, one ob-
tains

hAiρav = hAiρmc +

hAiρ(0) − hAiρmc

(9)

where ρmc := I/D is the microcanonical density operator
and I the identity on H. As a second result, one ﬁnds

the estimate

ξ(t) := hAiρ(t) −(cid:2)hAiρ(t)(cid:3)U
(cid:2)ξ2(t)(cid:3)U = O(∆2

ATr{ρ2(0)}/D)

for arbitrary t, where ∆A is the range of A, i.e., the dif-
ference between the largest and smallest eigenvalues of

(10)

A. Since averaging over U and integrating over t are
commuting operations, equation (11) implies that

(cid:19) (12)

for arbitrary t2 > t1.

Considering t in equation (11) as arbitrary but ﬁxed,
equation (10) and D ≫ 1 imply (obviously or by ex-
ploiting Chebyshev’s inequality [1, 9, 40, 43, 45]) that
hAiρ(t) is practically indistinguishable from the average
in (6) for the vast majority of all unitaries U . Indeed,
the fraction (normalized Haar measure) of exceptional
U ’s is unimaginably small for typical macroscopic sys-
tems with, say, f ≈ 1023 degrees of freedom, since D in
(11) is exponentially large in f (see below equation (1)).
Likewise, considering an arbitrary but ﬁxed time inter-
val [t1, t2] in equation (12), it follows for all but a tiny
fraction of U ’s that the time average over ξ2(t) on the
left hand side of (12) must be unimaginably small, and
hence also the integrand ξ2(t) itself must be exceedingly
small for the overwhelming majority of all t ∈ [t1, t2].
Accordingly, hAiρ(t) must remain extremely close to (6)
simultaneously for all those t ∈ [t1, t2].

Due to equation (9) and D ≫ 1, we furthermore can
safely approximate hAiρav in (6) by hAiρmc . Altogether,
we thus can conclude that in very good approximation

hAiρ(t) = hAiρmc + F (t) (cid:8)hAiρ(0) − hAiρmc(cid:9) (13)

for the vast majority of unitaries U and times t. As
detailed in “Methods”, the neglected corrections in (13)
consist of a systematic (U -independent) part, which is
bounded in modulus by ∆A/(D2 − 1) for all t, and a
random (U -dependent) part (namely ξ(t)), whose typical

order of magnitude is ∆ApTr{ρ2(0)}/D (for most U and

t, cf. equations (11), (12)), i.e., ξ(t) is dominating by far
(note that 1 ≥ Tr{ρ2(0)} ≥ Tr{ρ2
mc} = 1/D). Moreover,
the correlations of ξ(t) decay on time scales comparable
to those governing F (t).

These are our main formal results. In the rest of the

paper we discuss their physical content.

Basic properties of F (t)

Equation (8) implies that φ(0) = 1, φ(−t) = φ∗(t),
and |φ(t)| ≤ 1. With equation (7) and D ≫ 1 it follows
that in very good approximation

F (t) = |φ(t)|2 ,

(14)

and thus

F (0) = 1 , 0 ≤ F (t) ≤ 1 , F (−t) = F (t) .

(15)

Indicating averages over all t ≥ 0 by an over-
bar, one can infer from equations (8) and (14) that
k/D2, where k labels the eigenspaces of

F (t) = Pk d2

3

H with mutually diﬀerent eigenvalues and dk denotes

their dimensions. Since Pk dk = D we thus obtain

F (t) ≤ maxk(dk/D). Excluding extremely large mul-
tiplicities (degeneracies) of energy eigenvalues, it follows
that the time average F (t) is negligibly small and hence
[1, 9, 40, 43, 45] that F (t) itself must be negligibly small
for the overwhelming majority of all suﬃciently large t,
symbolically indicated as

F (t → ∞)   0 .

(16)

Note that there still exist arbitrarily large exceptional t’s
owing to the quasi-periodicity of φ(t) implied by (8). We
also emphasize that our main result (13) itself admits
arbitrary degeneracies of H.

As an example, we focus on the microcanonical setup
introduced below equation (1) and on not too large times,
so that (8) is well approximated by

φ(t) =Z E

E−∆E

ρ(x) eixt/ dx ,

(17)

where ρ(x) represents the (smoothened and normalized)
density of energy levels En in the vicinity of the reference
energy x. If the level density is constant throughout the
energy window [E − ∆E, E], we thus obtain with (14)

F (t) =

sin2(∆E t/2)

(∆E t/2)2

.

(18)

Next, we recall Boltzmann’s entropy formula S(x) =
kB ln(Ω(x)), where Ω(x) counts the number of En’s below
x and kB is Boltzmann’s constant. Hence, Ω′(x) must be
proportional to the level density ρ(x) from above. Fur-
thermore, T := 1/S′(E) is the usual microcanonical tem-
perature of a system with energy E at thermal equilib-
rium. A straightforward expansion then yields the ap-
proximation ρ(E − y) = c e−y/kBT for y ≥ 0, where c is
E−∆E ρ(x) dx = 1. The omitted higher order
terms are safely negligible for all y ≥ 0 and systems with
f ≫ 1 degrees of freedom, see also [53]. With equations
(14) and (17) one thus ﬁnds

ﬁxed via R E

F (t) =

1 − 2α cos(∆E t/) + α2
(1 − α)2[1 + (kBT t/)2]

,

(19)

where α := e−∆E/kBT . For ∆E ≪ kBT , one recovers
(18) and for ∆E ≫ kBT one obtains

F (t) =

1

1 + (kBT t/)2 .

(20)

Typicality of thermalization

Equations (13) and (16) imply thermalization in the
sense that the expectation value hAiρ(t) becomes (for
most U ) practically indistinguishable from the micro-
canonical average hAiρmc for the overwhelming majority

of all suﬃciently large t. Exceptional t’s are, for instance,
due to quantum revivals, which, in turn, are apparently
closely related to the quasi-periodicities of F (t).

Our assumption that energy eigenvalues must not be
extremely highly degenerate (see above equation (16)) is
similar to Refs. [46, 47, 49–51] but considerably weaker
than the corresponding premises in most other related
works [1, 8–12, 39–45].

The usual time inversion invariance on the fundamen-
tal, microscopic level [7] is maintained by (13) due to
(15). Surprisingly, and in accordance with the second law
of thermodynamics, the latter symmetry persists even if
it is broken in the microscopic quantum dynamics, e.g.,
by an external magnetic ﬁeld!

By propagating ρ(0) backward in time (with respect
to one particular U ) and taking the result as new initial
state, one may easily tailor [41] examples of the very
rare U ’s and t’s which notably deviate from the typical
behavior (13). Equivalently, one may back-propagate A
instead of ρ(0) (Heisenberg picture).

Note that S and T were introduced below equation (18)
not in the sense of associating some entropy and temper-
ature to the non-equilibrium states ρ(t), but rather as
a convenient level-counting tool. However, we now can
identify them a posteriori with the pertinent entropy and
temperature after thermalization.

The randomization via U (see section “Analytical re-
sults”) can be viewed in two ways: Either one considers
ρ(0), A, and the spectrum of H as arbitrary but ﬁxed,
while the eigenbasis of H is sampled from a uniform dis-
tribution (Haar measure). Or one considers H and the
spectra of ρ(0) and A as arbitrary but ﬁxed and ran-
domizes the eigenvectors of A and ρ(0). In doing so, a
key point is that the relative orientation of the eigen-
bases of ρ(0) and A can be chosen arbitrarily but then
is kept ﬁxed. Indeed, it is well known [12, 49] that for
“most” such orientations the expectation values hAiρ(0)
and hAiρmc are practically indistinguishable, i.e., an ini-
tial hAiρ(0) far from equilibrium requires a careful ﬁne-
tuning of ρ(0) relatively to A.

In reality, there is usually nothing random in the actual
physical systems one has in mind. Hence, results like
(13), which (approximately) apply to the overwhelming
majority of unitaries U , should be physically interpreted
according to the common lore of random matrix theory
[9, 10, 12], namely as to apply practically for sure to
a concrete system under consideration, unless there are
particular reasons to the contrary.

Such reasons arise, for instance, when A is known to
be a conserved quantity, implying a common eigenbasis
of A and H, i.e., the basis transformations U must in-
deed be very special. Furthermore, this non-typicality
is structurally stable against suﬃciently small pertur-
bations of A and/or H so that the eigenvectors remain
“almost aligned” (each eigenvector of A mainly overlaps
with one or a few eigenvectors of H) and hence A remains
“almost conserved” (almost commuting with H). Anal-
ogous non-typical U ’s are expected when ρ(0) is known

4

to be (almost) conserved (commuting with H).

Further well-known exceptions are integrable systems,
for which thermalization in the above sense may be ab-
sent for certain ρ(0) and A [4, 32] (but not for others
[22]), systems exhibiting many-body localization [34, 36],
or trivial cases with non-interacting subsystems (see also
Supplementary Note 2).

Our present focus is diﬀerent: Taking thermalization
for granted, is the temporal relaxation well approximated
by equation (13)?

Typical fast relaxation and prethermalization

Equation (20) is governed by the Boltzmann time tB :=
h/kBT , amounting to tB ≈ 10−13 s at room temperature.
Equation (19) gives rise to comparably short time scales,
unless the temperature is exceedingly low or the energy
window ∆E is unusually small. Such relaxation times are
much shorter than commonly observed in real systems
[46, 49–51]. Moreover, the temporal decay is typically
non-exponential (see e.g. (18)-(20)), again in contrast to
the usual ﬁndings.

This seems to imply that typical experiments corre-
spond to non-typical unitaries U . Plausible explanations
are as follows: To begin with, the above predicted typical
relaxation times are so short that they simply could not
be observed in most experiments. Second (or as a conse-
quence), the usual initial conditions and/or observables
are indeed quite “special” with respect to the prominent
role of almost conserved quantities (see previous section),
in particular “local descendants” of globally conserved
quantities like energy, charge, particle numbers, etc.: Ex-
amples are the amount of energy, charge etc. within some
subdomain of the total system, or, more generally, lo-
cal densities, whose content within a given volume can
only change via transport currents through the bound-
aries of that volume. As a consequence, the global relax-
ation process becomes “unusually slow” if the densities
between macroscopically separated places need to equi-
librate (small surface-to-volume ratio), or if there exists
a natural “bottleneck” for their exchange (weakly inter-
acting subsystems).

Put diﬀerently, our present theory is meant to describe
the very rapid relaxation towards local equilibrium, but
not any subsequent global equilibration. Only if there ex-
ists a clear-cut time-scale separation between these two
relaxation steps (or if there is no second step at all) can
we hope to quantitatively capture the ﬁrst step by our
results. Conversely, the time scale-separation usually ad-
mits some Markovian approximation for the second step,
yielding an exponential decay, whose time scale still de-
pends on many details of the system.

Natural further generalizations include the closely re-
lated concepts of hindered equilibrium, quasi-equilibrium
(metastability), and, above all, prethermalization [29, 54,
55], referring, e.g., to a fast partial thermalization within
a certain subset of modes, (quasi-)particles, or other gen-

at the end of section “Typical fast relaxation and prether-
malization”, the depicted prethermalization is followed by a
much slower, global thermalization [29], which is omitted in
the present ﬁgure.

eralized degrees of freedom. (Like in [54], we do not adopt
here the additional requirement [55] that the almost con-
served quantities originate from a weak perturbation of
an integrable system.)

In short, our working hypothesis is that the theory
(13) describes the temporal relaxation of hAiρ(t) for any
given pair (ρ(0), A) unless one of them is exceptionally
close to or in some other way slowed down by an (almost)
conserved quantity.

Comparison with experimental results

We focus on experiments in closed many-body systems
in accordance with the above general requirements. In
comparing them with our theory (13), we furthermore
assume that the (pre-)thermalized system occupies a mi-
crocanonical energy window with some (eﬀective) tem-
perature T and ∆E ≫ kBT , so that (20) applies. Fi-
nally, the asymptotic values hAiρ(0) and hAiρmc in (13)
are either obvious or will be estimated from the mea-
surements, hence no further knowledge about the often
quite involved details of the experimental observables will
be needed!

Fig. 1 demonstrates the very good agreement of the
theory with the rapid initial prethermalization of a co-
herently split Bose gas, observed by the Schmiedmayer
group in Ref. [29].

In Fig. 2, the theory is compared with the pump-probe
experiment by the Bigot group from Ref. [56]. The ﬁnite
widths of the pump and the probe laser pulses are roughly

FIG. 2: Ultrafast relaxation of hot electrons. A ﬁrst
laser pulse (at t = 0) “heats up” the electron gas in a thin
ferromagnetic ﬁlm, whose re-thermalization is then probed by
means of a second laser pulse. As detailed in [56], the con-
sidered observable “diﬀerential transmission” quantiﬁes the
magneto-optical polarization rotation of the probe laser light.
Symbols: Experimental data from Fig. 2a of Ref. [56]. Dot-
ted: Theoretical prediction (13), (20) with T = 310 K and
F (t < 0) := 1. Solid: Convolution of the dotted line with a
Gaussian of 35 fs FWHM, accounting for the ﬁnite widths of
the pump and probe laser pulses (see also main text). Simi-
larly as in Fig. 1, on larger time-scales than covered by the
present ﬁgure, the prethermalized electrons also exhibit non-
negligible interactions with the lattice phonons and magnons,
resulting in a much slower global relaxation of the compound
electron-lattice system [56]. Concerning the pertinent tem-
perature T , a direct experimental estimate is not available
for the setup from Ref. [56] (I contacted one of the authors),
but it has been provided for a similar experiment by the same
group in Ref.
[58], except that the ﬂuence (energy per spot
area of the pump laser pulse) was 70 times larger than in [56].
Taking all this into account, the estimate T = 310 K adopted
in the present ﬁgure seems very reasonable.

accounted for by convoluting equation (13) with a Gaus-
sian of 35 fs FWHM (Full Width at Half Maximum). In
Ref. [56], the FWHM of the pump pulse is estimated as
20 fs and the combined FWHM for both pulses as 22 fs,
implying a FWHM of 9 fs for the probe pulse. The lat-
ter value seem quite optimistic to us. A second “excuse”
for our slightly larger FWHM value of 35 fs is that the
tails of the experimental pulse shape may be consider-
ably broader than those of a Gaussian with the same
FWHM (see, e.g., Fig. 2c in the supplemental material
of Ref.
[57]). Finally, the convolution of (13) with a
Gaussian represents a rather poor “eﬀective description”
in the ﬁrst place: Our entire theoretical approach be-
comes strictly speaking invalid when the duration of the
perturbation becomes comparable to the thermalization
time.

A similar comparison with the pump-probe experi-
ments by Faure at al.
[59] is presented in
Fig. 3. As before, we adopted a slightly larger FWHM
of 100 fs than the estimate of 76 fs in [59]. Due to the
above mentioned fundamental limitations of our theory
for such rather large FWHM values, the temperatures

2, but now conducted on bismuth and for 6 diﬀerent ﬂuences
(energy per spot area of the pump laser pulses). As detailed
in [59], the considered observable Nexc quantiﬁes (in arbi-
trary units) the number of excited electrons above the Fermi
level. The depicted data are from Fig. 5b of Ref. [59] for ﬂu-
ences (top-down) 0.12, 0.2, 0.36, 0.52, 0.68, and 0.84 mJ cm−2.
Lines: Theoretical prediction (13), (20) with temperatures as
indicated and convoluted with a Gaussian of 100 fs FWHM
(see also main text). The conversion of a given ﬂuence into
a temperature change of the electron gas is not obvious. In
particular, the estimates provided in [59] seem not very reli-
able to us: First of all, Fig. 6 in [59] indicates a temperature
of ca. 250 K at 4 diﬀerent time-points about 200 fs before the
pump pulse, while the actual temperature of the unperturbed
system is known to be 130 K. Second, the temperature error
bars in Fig. 6b of [59] are quite large. Third, a key premise
of those estimates in [59] is that the “renormalized” curves in
Fig. 3S(B) of [60] should coincide, while their actual agree-
ment is only moderately better than for the “bare” curves in
Fig. 3S(A). For all these reasons, we used the temperature as
a ﬁt parameter in the present ﬁgure.

adopted in Fig. 3 should still be considered as quite
crude estimates. Apart from that, Fig. 3 nicely conﬁrms
the predicted temperature dependence from (20).

We close with three remarks: First, Refs. [56, 59] also
implicitly conﬁrm our prediction that the essential tem-
poral relaxation (encapsulated by F (t) in (13)) is gener-
ically the same for diﬀerent observables. Second, sim-
ilar pump-probe experiments abound in the literature,
but usually the pulse-widths are too large for our pur-
poses. Third, the temporal relaxation in Figs. 1-3 has
also been investigated numerically, but closed analytical
results have not been available before [29, 59].

FIG. 4: Relaxation of an integrable (top) and a non-
integrable (bottom) fermionic model. Symbols: Numer-
ical results from Ref. [32] for 8 strongly correlated fermions on
a one-dimensional lattice with 24 sites, described in terms of
an extended Hubbard model with nearest- and next-nearest-
neighbor hopping and interaction parameters τ , τ ′, V , and
V ′, respectively. Working in units with  = kB = τ = V = 1
and focusing on parameters τ ′ = V ′, the model is integrable if
τ ′ = V ′ = 0 and non-integrable otherwise. A quantum quench
generates an initial pure state out of equilibrium, whose en-
ergy corresponds to that of a canonical ensemble with temper-
ature T = 2. As detailed in [32], the considered observable
δNk(t) is a dimensionless descendant of the density-density
structure factor. The depicted data are from Fig. 1(g),(j)
of Ref.
[32]. Lines: Theoretical predictions (13), (20) with
T = 2.

Comparison with numerical results

Fig. 4 illustrates the very good agreement of our theory
[32], both for
with Rigol’s numerical ﬁndings from Ref.
an integrable and an non-integrable example. A similar
agreement is found for all other parameters and also for
an analogous hardcore boson model examined in Refs.
[31, 32]. On the other hand, a second observable con-
sidered in Ref.
[32], deriving from the momentum dis-
tribution function, exhibits in all cases a signiﬁcantly
slower and also qualitatively diﬀerent temporal relax-
ation. According to the discussion in section “Typical
fast relaxation and prethermalization”, it is quite plausi-
ble that the latter observable is indeed “non-typical” in
view of the fact that it represents a conserved quantity
for fermions with V = τ ′ = V ′ = 0 [32].

In Fig. 5 we compare our theory with the simula-
tions of a diﬀerent one-dimensional electron model by
Thon et al.
In doing so, the perti-
nent temperature T has been estimated as follows: The
textbook Sommerfeld-expansion for N electrons in a one-
dimensional box yields E = E0[1 + (3π2/8)(kBT /EF)2],
where E is their total energy, E0 = (1/3)N EF the ground
state energy, EF = (πN/gL)2/2m the Fermi-energy, L
the box length, m the electron mass, and g := 2s + 1 = 2

FIG. 5: Prethermalization in a one-dimensional elec-
tron gas.
[61]
for a one-dimensional model of the many-electron dynamics
in an asymmetric double-well potential (emulating a metal-
insulator-metal junction). Starting with 44 electrons in the
ground state, a laser pulse-like electrical perturbation acts
predominantly on the 16 electrons in the smaller, box-shaped
well, and then their re-thermalization is monitored via the
charge transfer into the larger well (denoted in (a) as CT (t)),
and via the change of the ground state population (denoted in
(b) as ∆P (t)). Depicted are the numerical results from Fig.
8 of Ref.
[61]. For further details regarding the simulations
we refer to [61, 62]. Lines: Theoretical predictions (13), (20),
exploiting the estimate T = 170 K from the main text, and
neglecting the ﬁnite temporal width (20 fs) of the pulse. As
in Figs. 1-3, we are actually dealing with a prethermaliza-
tion process within the smaller well. The subsequent global
thermalization is much slower due to the high barrier between
the wells. Considering that hAiρmc is the only remaining ﬁt
parameter in the theory from (13) and (20), the agreement
with the simulations is remarkably good. In particular, the
two very diﬀerent observables CT (t) and ∆P (t) are indeed
governed by the same F (t), as predicted by (13), (20).

(s = 1/2 for electrons). Assuming that the pulse acts
solely on the small well implies N = 16, L ≃ 15 nm [61],
and E − E0 ≃ 0.045 eV (see Fig. 8a in [61]). Altogether,
we thus obtain T ≃ 170 K.

The remnant “ﬂuctuations” of the numerical data in
Figs. 4 and 5 can be readily explained as ﬁnite particle
number eﬀects (see Fig. 4 in [32] and Fig. 10 in [61]),
and their temporal correlations are as predicted below
equation (13). The seemingly rather strong ﬂuctuations
in Fig. 5 are a fallacy since the systematic changes them-
selves are very small.

Next we turn to the numerical ﬁndings for a qubit in
contact with a spin bath by the Trauzettel group from
Ref.
[63]. The agreement with our theory in Fig. 6
is as good as it possibly can be for such a rather small
dimensionality of D = 27.
Indeed, the remaining dif-
ferences nicely conﬁrm the predictions below equation

FIG. 6: Thermalization of a spin qubit coupled to a

Ref. [63]: A central spin (qubit) is randomly (and reasonably

the product of a totally mixed bath state and an eigenstate of
the central spin component Sx. Depicted are the data from
Fig. 2 of Ref. [63] for the central spin component Sx. Dashed:
Theoretical prediction (13), (14), (8). Due to the above men-
tioned initial condition and the quite small dimension D = 27,
the approximations (18)-(20) are not very well satisﬁed by the
actual energy eigenvalues E1,...,E128 (kindly provided by the
authors of Ref. [63]). Hence, we have evaluated F (t) in (13)
directly via (14) and (8).

poral correlations (where we exploited that Tr{ρ2(0)} =
2−6 for the particular initial condition ρ(0) adopted in
Fig. 6).

Our ﬁnal example is Bartsch and Gemmer’s random
matrix model from Ref.
[17]. Referring to the notation
and deﬁnitions in the caption of Fig. 7, one readily sees
that the considered observable A is a conserved quantity
for the unperturbed Hamiltonian (λ = 0). In agreement
with our discussion in section “Typical fast relaxation
and prethermalization”, A is therefore still “almost con-
served” for small λ and indeed exhibits a slow, expo-
nential decay towards hAiρmc = 0 (see Fig. 1a in [17]).
Upon increasing λ, one recovers the much faster, non-
exponential decay of our present theory (see Fig. 1b in
[17]). Unfortunately, the λ-value 1.77 · 10−3 from Fig.
1b of [17] is still somewhat too small and the eigenval-
ues E1, ..., E6000 are not any more available (I asked the
authors). Therefore, we repeated the numerics from [17]
on our own for λ = 7 · 10−3. The resulting agreement
with (13) in Fig. 7 is very good, and the temporal cor-
relations of the deviations as well as their typical order

of magnitude ∆ApTr{ρ2(0)}/D = 2p1/6000 ≃ 0.03 are

as predicted below (13).

We close with two remarks: First, there is no ﬁt pa-
rameter in any of the above examples apart from hAiρ(0)
in Fig. 4 and hAiρmc in Figs. 4 and 5. Second, especially
in the case of the integrable model in Fig. 4, one may
question whether the considered system exhibits thermal-
ization in the ﬁrst place, as is tacitly assumed in equation
(13). In Supplementary Note 2 we argue that (13) indeed
is expected to still remain valid in such cases if hAiρmc is
replaced by the pertinent non-thermal long-time asymp-
totics (which, in turn, is estimated from the numerical

FIG. 7: Thermalization in a random matrix model.
Solid: Numerical results for the random matrix model of the
form H = H0 + λV from Ref.
[17]. Adopting dimensionless
units with  = 1, the D = 6000 eigenvalues of H0 are chosen
equidistant with level spacing 8.33 · 10−5 [17]. The matrix
elements of A (observable) and V (perturbation) in the basis
of H0 satisfy Aik = (−1)kδik and Vki = V ∗
ik. Apart from the
latter constraint, the real and imaginary parts of Vik are inde-
pendent, normally distributed random numbers. The initial
state is ρ(0) = |ψihψ|, where |ψi is randomly sampled from
the energy shell H under the constraint hAiρ(0) ≃ 0.2 [17].
Depicted are three representative numerical realizations for
λ = 7·10−3 akin to Fig. 1b of Ref. [17] (in dimesionless units).

data in Fig. 4).

Discussion

Our main result (13) implies thermalization in the
sense that a generic non-equilibrium system with a
macroscopically well deﬁned energy becomes practically
indistinguishable from the corresponding microcanonical
ensemble for the overwhelming majority of all suﬃciently
late times. Apart from the concrete initial and long-time
expectation values (i.e. hAiρ(0) and hAiρmc in (13)), the
temporal relaxation (i.e. F (t) in (13)) depends only on
the spectrum of the Hamiltonian within the pertinent in-
terval of non-negligibly populated energy eigenstates, but
not on any further details of the initial condition or the
observable. This represents one of the rare instances of
a general quantitative statement about systems far from
equilibrium.

The theory agrees very well with a wide variety of
experimental and numerical results from the literature
(though none of them was originally conceived for the
purpose of such a comparison). We are in fact not aware
of any other quantitative analytical explanation of those
data comparable to ours. Indeed, the usual paradigm to
identify and then analytically quantify the main physi-
cal mechanisms seems almost hopeless here. In a sense,
our present approach thus amounts to a new paradigm:
There is no need of any further “explanations” since the
observed behavior is expected with overwhelming likeli-

8

hood from the very beginning, i.e., unless there are spe-
cial a priori reasons to the contrary.

Similarly as in [46, 49–51], generic thermalization is
found to happen extremely quickly (unless the system’s
energy or temperature is exceedingly low). Moreover, the
temporal decay is typically non-exponential. A main pre-
diction of our theory is that these features should in fact
be very common (at least in the form of prethermaliza-
tion), but often they are unmeasurably fast or they have
simply not been looked for so far. Conversely, most of
the usually considered observables and initial conditions
are actually quite “special”, namely exceptionally slow,
“almost conserved” quantities. A better understanding
of those principally untypical but practically very com-
mon thermalization processes remains an open problem
[49–51].

METHODS

Basic matrices

According to section “Analytical results”, the unitary
U represents the basis transformation between the eigen-
vectors |ni (n = 1, ..., D) of the Hamiltonian H and those
of the observable A. Denoting the eigenvalues of A by λν
and the eigenvectors by |ψνi (ν = 1, ..., D), the matrix
elements of U are thus Unν := hn|ψνi. Accordingly, the
matrix elements of ρ(0) in the basis of H are related to
those in the basis of A via

ρmn(0) =

D

Xµ,ν=1

Umµ ρµν U ∗

nν ,

(21)

where ρµν := hψµ|ρ(0)|ψνi. Similarly, the matrix ele-
ments of A satisfy

Amn =

D

Xξ=1

Umξ λξ U ∗
nξ

(22)

and hence

ρmn(0)Anm =

D

Xµ,ν,ξ=1

ρµν λξ UmµU ∗

nνUnξU ∗

mξ .

(23)

As announced below equation (3), we work (without
loss of generality) in a reference frame (or reference basis
of H) so that only H (and thus |ni) depends on U , while
A and ρ(0) (and thus |ψνi) are independent of U . Hence,
ρµν and λξ on the right hand side of equations (21)-(23)
are independent of U .

Derivation of equation (9)

As a simple ﬁrst exercise, let us average equation (23)
over all uniformly (Haar) distributed unitaries U , as

speciﬁed in section “Analytical results”. Since the fac-
tors ρµν λξ on the right hand side are independent of U ,
we are left with averages over the U matrix elements.
Such averages have been evaluated repeatedly and of-
ten independently of each other in the literature, see e.g.
[5, 64–66], a key ingredient being symmetry arguments
due to the invariance of the Haar measure under arbi-
trary unitary transformations. Particularly convenient
for our present purposes is the formalism adopted by
Brouwer and Beenakker, see Ref.
[66] and further ref-
erences therein. The general structure of such averages
is provided by equation (2.2) in [66], reading

where β1 = b2 and β2 = b1.

There are two permutations of the numbers 1, 2,
namely the identity and one, which exchanges 1 and 2.
Denoting them as P1 and P2, respectively, and observing
that βj = bP2(j), equation (27) can be rewritten as

Quoting verbatim from Ref.
[66], “the summation is
over all permutations P and P ′ of the numbers 1, ..., n.
The coeﬃcients VP,P ′ depend only on the cycle struc-
ture of the permutation P −1P ′. Recall that each per-
mutation of 1, ..., n has a unique factorization in disjoint
cyclic permutations (“cycles”) of lengths c1, ...., ck (where
j=1 cj). The statement that VP,P ′ depends only on
the cycle structure of P −1P ′ means that VP,P ′ depends
only on the lengths c1, ..., ck of the cycles in the factoriza-
tion of P −1P ′. One may therefore write Vc1,...,ck instead
of VP,P ′ .” The explicit numerical values of all Vc1,...,ck
with n ≤ 5 are provided by the columns “CUE” of Ta-
bles II and IV in [66]. Further remarks: The labels m and
n in (24) have nothing to do with those in (23). Equation
(24) equals zero unless m = n. Every label aj must have
a “partner”, i.e., its value must coincide with one of the
αj’s, and vice versa, since otherwise the product over the
Kronecker delta’s δaj αP (j) in (24) would be zero for all
P ’s. Note that some aj’s may assume the same value,
but then an equal number of αj’s also must assume that
value. Likewise, every bj needs a “partner” among the
βj’s, and vice versa.

Adopting the abbreviation

Xmn := [ρmn(0)Anm]U

(25)

and the renamings a1 := m, a2 := n, b1 := µ, b2 := ξ,
b3 := ν, equation (23) yields

Xa1a2 = Xb1,b2,b3

ρb1b3λb2(cid:2)Ua1b1 Ua2b2 U ∗

a1b2 U ∗

a2b3(cid:3)U . (26)

The connection with (24) is established via the identiﬁca-
tions α1 := a1, α2 := a2, β1 := b2, β2 := b3. Therefore, if
b1 6= b2 then the only potential “partner” of b1 is β2, and
only if their values coincide, i.e. b3 = b1, the correspond-
ing summands may be non-zero. The same conclusion
can be drawn if b1 = b2. We thus can rewrite (26) with
(24) as

Xa1a2 = Xb1,b2

ρb1b1 λb2 XP,P ′

VP,P ′

Yj=1

δaj aP (j) δbj βP ′(j) (27)

ρb1b1 λb1 = Tr{ρ(0)A} .

(30)

S1 =Xb1

The last equality can be veriﬁed by evaluating the trace
in the eigenbasis of A, see above equation (21). In the
same way, one ﬁnds that

S2 = Xb1,b2

ρb1b1λb2 = Tr{ρ(0)}Tr{A} = DTr{ρmcA} .(31)

In the last equation, we exploited that Tr{ρ(0)} = 1 and
ρmc := I/D, see below equation (9). Observing that the
two Kronecker delta’s in (28) equal one if k = 1 or if
k = 2 and a1 = a2, the overall result is

Xa1a2 = hAiρ(0)(VP1,P1 + δa1a2VP2,P1 )

+ DhAiρmc (VP1,P2 + δa1a2VP2,P2 ) ,

(32)

where, as usual, hAiρ(0)
Tr{ρmcA}.

:= Tr{ρ(0)A} and hAiρmc

Finally, the coeﬃcients VPk,Pl are evaluated as ex-
plained below equation (24): If k = l then P −1
l Pk = P1
i.e.
factorizes in two cycles of lengths c1 = c2 = 1,
VPk,Pl = Vc1,c2 = V1,1. Likewise, if k 6= l then P −1
l Pk =
P2 consists of one cycle with c1 = 2, i.e. VPk,Pl = V2.
Referring to columns “CUE” and rows “n = 2” of Ta-
bles II and IV in Ref. [66] yields V1,1 = 1/(D2 − 1) and
V2 = −1/[D(D2 − 1)]. Returning to the original labels
m and n in equation (25), we thus can rewrite (32) as

Xmn = hAiρ(0)

D − δmn
D(D2 − 1)

+ hAiρmc

Dδmn − 1

D2 − 1

. (33)

As a consequence, we can infer from equations (4) and

(25) that hAiρav = DXnn and with (33) that

hAiρav = hAiρ(0)

D + 1

+ hAiρmc

.

(34)

Hence, one readily recovers equation (9).

A relation remarkably similar to our present equation
(9), albeit in a quite diﬀerent physical context, has been
previously obtained also in Ref.
[67] (see equation (2)
therein).

Derivation of equation (11)

Without any doubt, there are much faster ways to ob-
tain equations (33) or (34). The advantage of our present
way is that it can be readily adopted without any con-
ceptual diﬀerences (albeit the actual calculations become
more lengthy) to more demanding cases like

(cid:2)ξ2(t)(cid:3)U =hhAi2

ρ(t)iU

see equation (10).

−(cid:2)hAiρ(t)(cid:3)2

U ,

(35)

To evaluate the last term in (35), we recast equation

(6) with (7) and (9) into the form

(cid:2)hAiρ(t)(cid:3)U = F0(t) hAiρ(0) + ¯F0(t)hAiρmc + R1(t)(36)

hAiρmc − hAiρ(0)

F0(t) :=

Xm,n=1

(38)

ei(En−Em)t/ = |φ(t)|2 , (39)

where φ(t) is deﬁned in equation (8). Similarly as in
equation (15), one sees that F0(t), ¯F0(t) ∈ [0, 1] for all
t. Denoting by λmax and λmin the largest and smallest
among the eigenvalues λ1, ..., λD of A, the range of A is
deﬁned as ∆A := λmax − λmin. Furthermore, we can and
will add a constant to A so that λmin = −λmax with-
out any change in the ﬁnal conclusions below. It readily
follows that |λν | ≤ ∆A/2 for all ν and hence that

|hAκiρ| ≤ (∆A/2)κ

(40)

for arbitrary density operators ρ and κ ∈ N. We thus can
infer from equation (37) that

|R1(t)| ≤ ∆A/(D2 − 1) .

(41)

Likewise, one ﬁnds upon squaring equation (36) that

(cid:2)hAiρ(t)(cid:3)2

U = (F0(t) hAiρ(0) + ¯F0(t)hAiρmc )2 + R2(t)(42)
(43)

A/(D2 − 1) .

|R2(t)| ≤ 3∆2

Turning to the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (35),
one can infer, similarly as in (25), (26), from (1) and (23)
that

(45)

a4β4(cid:3)U

with β1 := b2, β2 := b5, β3 := b4, β4 := b6. Similarly as
below equation (26) it follows that only those summands
may be non-zero, for which b1 and b3 have “partners”
among β2 and β4, and vice versa. This condition can

10

be satisﬁed in two ways: (i) b5 = b1 and b6 = b3. (ii)
b5 = b3 and b6 = b1 and b1 6= b3. The latter condition is
due to the fact that the case b1 = b3 is already covered
by (i). Exploiting (24) and with the abbreviation ~a :=

Observing that β(i)
j = bP19(j) for all
j = 1, ..., 4, it is quite straightforward but very arduous
to explicitly carry out the sums over P ′ and ~b in (47),
(48) and the sum over ~a in (44), yielding

To explicitly evaluate (49)-(51), we still need the coef-
ﬁcients VPk,Pl for all k, l ∈ {1, ..., 24}. They are obtained
as explained below equation (24): Deﬁning j = j(k, l)
implicitly via Pj = P −1
l Pk, one ﬁnds by factorizing each
Pj into its disjoint cycles and exploiting Tables II and IV
of Ref. [66] that VPk,Pl is given by

V1,1,1,1 = D−4 for j = 1,

V2,1,1 = −D−5 for j = 2, ..., 7,
V2,2 = D−6 for j = 8, ..., 10,
V3,1 = 2 D−6 for j = 11, ..., 18,
V4 = −5 D−7 for j = 19, ..., 24,

(52)

up to correction factors of the form 1 + O(D−2) on the
right hand side of each of those relations. One thus is
left with ﬁnding Pj = P −1
l Pk for all 242 pairs (k, l). To
mitigate this daunting task, we have restricted ourselves
to those summands in (49) which are at least of the order
D−1. Along these lines, one ﬁnally recovers with equa-
tions (35), (40), and (42) the result (11).

Derivation of equation (13)

While the essential steps in deriving equation (13) have
been outlined already in the main text, we still have to

11

provide the details of the statements below (13): Our ﬁrst
observation is that R1(t) in equation (36) amounts to the
systematic (U -independent) part of the omitted correc-
tions in (13) and equation (41) to the bound announced
below (13).

By means of a straightforward (but again very tedious)
generalization of the calculations from the preceding sub-
section one ﬁnds that

[ξ(t)ξ(s)]U = C(t, s)

∆2

ATr{ρ2(0)}

D

+ O(cid:18) ∆2

D2(cid:19) (53)

A

where C(t, s) has the following six properties: First,
C(t, s) = C(s, t) = C(−t, −s) for all t, s.
Second,
|C(t, s)| ≤ 9 for all t, s. Third, C(t, 0) = 0 for all t.
Fourth, C(t, s)   0 for |t − s| → ∞, cf. equation (16).
Fifth, C(t, s)   F (t − s)h(A − hAiρmc )2iρmc for t, s → ∞.
Sixth, given s, the behavior of C(t, s) as a function of t
is roughly comparable to that of F (t − s) for most t.

Though we did not explicitly evaluate the last term
in (53), closer inspection of its general structure shows
that it can be bounded in modulus by c ∆2
A/D2 for some
c which is independent of t, s, D, A, ρ(0), H. Moreover,
there is no indication of any fundamental structural dif-
ferences in comparison with the leading and next-to-
leading order terms, which we did evaluate.
In other
words, the last term in (53) is expected to satisfy prop-
erties analogous to those mentioned below equation (53).
Recalling that the purity Tr{ρ2(0)} satisﬁes the usual
bounds 1 ≥ Tr{ρ2(0)} ≥ Tr{ρ2
mc} = 1/D, we thus re-
cover the properties of ξ(t) announced below equation
(13).

Supplementary Note 1

This note provides a brief account of those previous
analytical ﬁndings which exhibit some appreciable simi-
larity to ours.

Ref. [1] (see Supplementary References) considers the
convergence (for most times) towards some steady state,
which is in general diﬀerent from the microcanonical en-
semble. Furthermore, the focus is either on two-outcome
measurements, where one of the projectors is of low rank,
or the initial state must be an eigenvector of the consid-
ered observable. Finally, a role more or less similar to our
present randomization via U is played by the assumption
that the initial state must be spread over very many en-
ergy levels. Within this setting, general upper bounds
are obtained for some suitably deﬁned equilibration time
scale (as opposed to the (approximate) equality (13) for
the entire temporal behavior). Apart from these quite
signiﬁcant diﬀerences, the essential conclusions are anal-
ogous to ours, namely an extremely rapid relaxation for
all above mentioned two-outcome measurements of low
rank, as well as for most observables if the initial state is
an eigenvector of the observable.

Ref.

[2] focuses on subsystem-plus-bath compounds,
the total Hilbert space being a collection of many smaller
units (e.g. due to a local Hamiltonian on a lattice), and
on separable initial states. Under these premises, up-
per bounds for the subsystem’s temporal relaxation are
derived, which exhibit some (limited) similarities to our
present ﬁndings, including the prediction of typically very
fast relaxation processes.

Under the additional assumptions that in the latter
setup the subsystem is a single qubit, the initial state of
the qubit as well as the considered observable are given by
Pauli matrices (or the identity), and the environment is
in a pure initial state, similar ﬁndings as in our present
work have been obtained in Ref.
[3]. Note that those
initial states of the qubit are not very physical and that
their linear superposition is not admitted in the ﬁndings
of [3] due to the non-linearity of the problem.

Refs.

[4,5] focus on macroscopic observables with a
concomitant projector Pneq onto a very small subspace
of the “energy shell” H so that any (normalized) state
|ψi ∈ H with hψ|Pneq|ψi ≪ 1 represents thermal equi-
librium. Denoting, similarly as in our present approach,
by U the transformation between the bases of the “ob-
servable” Pneq and the Hamiltonian H, it is then shown
that most U result in an extremely quick thermalization
for any initial pure state |ψ(0)i ∈ H. Similarly as in [1]
(see above), this conclusion is based on an upper (but
arguably rather tight) estimate for the actual temporal
relaxation and on similar assumptions about the energy
level density ρ(x) as in equations (17)-(20).

In Ref. [6] it is shown that the vast majority of all pure
states featuring a common expectation value of some
generic observable at a given time will yield very similar

expectation values of the same observable at any later
time. While in our present approach, ρ(0) and A are
kept ﬁxed relatively to each other and U randomizes their
constellation relatively to the Hamiltonian H, in Ref. [6]
the pair A and H is kept ﬁxed, while ρ(0) is randomly
sampled under the additional constraint that it is a pure
state with a preset (arbitrary but ﬁxed) expectation value
hAiρ(0). Moreover, no quantitative statements about how
hAiρ(t) actually evolves in time have been obtained in [6].
Ref. [7] suggests fairly rough relaxation time estimates
by exploiting three quite drastic a priori assumptions.
One of them postulates that the relaxation is monotonous
in time, which can in fact not be generally true, see equa-
tion (19) and Fig. 6. Apart from that, the obtained
estimates are roughly comparable to ours.

Supplementary Note 2

This note compiles some additional remarks and ex-
tensions, ordered according to their appearance in the
main text.

Regarding section “Setup”

1. In the present paper, we mainly have in mind the ex-
amples mentioned below equation (1), i.e., H represents
some microcanonical “energy shell” of a closed many-
body system. But similarly as in Refs. [8-10], our main
result (13) is actually valid for the more general setup
outlined above equation (1), i.e., H may also represent
a more abstract type of “active Hilbert space”. For in-
stance, this may be of interest for autonomous systems
with few degrees of freedom in the context of semiclas-
sical chaos when the initial state is “spread” over many
energy levels.

2. A priori, the pertinent Hilbert space of a many-body
system is not a microcanonical energy shell H, nor are
the Hamiltonian, observables, and system states given
by Hermitian operators H, A, and ρ(t) on H right from
the beginning. Rather, the system originally “lives” in
a much larger Hilbert space H′ and the Hamiltonian,
observables, and system states are given by Hermitian
operators H ′, A′, and ρ′(t) on H′. How to go over from
the original (primed) to the reduced (unprimed) setup is
not very diﬃcult [11-15], but also not entirely obvious:

Similarly as in the main text, we denote by En and
|ni the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of H ′, where n runs
from 1 to inﬁnity or to some ﬁnite upper limit (dimen-
sion of H′). Likewise, the corresponding matrix ele-
ments of ρ′(t) are denoted as ρ′
mn(t) := hm|ρ′(t)|ni. The
key point consist in our assumption below equation (1)
that the system exhibit a well deﬁned macroscopic en-
ergy, i.e., there exists a microcanonical energy window
I := [E − ∆E, E] so that the level populations ρ′
nn(0)
are negligibly small for energies En outside the interval
I. Moreover, we can an will assume that the labels n and

14

mn|2 ≤ ρ′

mmρ′

by P := PD

the integer D are chosen so that En ∈ I ⇔ n ∈ {1, ..., D}.
Next, we denote by H the subspace spanned by {|ni}D
n=1,
n=1 |nihn| the projector onto H, and by
H := P H ′P , A := P A′P , ρ(t) := P ρ′(t)P the corre-
sponding “restrictions” or “projections” of the original
operators. With |ρ′
nn (Cauchy-Schwarz in-
equality) and the above approximation ρ′
nn(0) = 0 for
n > D, it follows that ρ′
mn(0) = 0 if m > D or n > D
and hence that ρ(0) = ρ′(0). Since P commutes with H ′
t := e−iH ′t/, the original time evolution
and thus with U ′
ρ′(t) = U ′
t)† implies that ρ(t) = ρ′(t) for all t,
and with P 2 = P it follows that ρ(t) = Utρ(0)U †
t , where
Ut := e−iHt/. Exploiting the cyclic invariance of the
trace and P 2 = P ﬁnally yields Tr{ρ′(t)A′} = Tr{ρ(t)A}
for all t.

tρ′(0)(U ′

So far, the basic operators H, A, ρ(t) and their descen-
dants Ut and Tr{ρ(t)A} are strictly speaking still deﬁned
on H′ but it is trivial to reinterpret them as being deﬁned
on H. In particular, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
H : H → H are now given by {En}D
n=1, re-
spectively. While the connection between H and H ′ and
between ρ(t) and ρ′(t) is thus rather trivial, the eigen-
values and eigenvectors of A are in general quite diﬀer-
ent from those of A′. Nevertheless, all original (primed)
expectation values are correctly recovered within the re-
duced (unprimed) formalism.

n=1 and {|ni}D

Regarding section “Analytical results”

3. A natural

intuitive guess is that ρnn(0) and
Ann should be essentially independent of each other in
the sense that [ρnn(0)Ann]U can be approximated by
[ρnn(0)]U [Ann]U . If so, one could readily conclude from
equations (2) and (4) that hAiρav = hAiρmc , which is noth-
ing else than the leading order approximation of equation
(9). In other words, our guess seems right, the essence
of equation (9) is intuitively quite obvious, and the last
term in equation (9) must be due to weak correlations
between ρnn(0) and Ann for non-equilibrium initial con-
ditions hAiρ(0).

Regarding section “Basic properties of F (t)”

4. The essential prerequisite in approximating equa-
tion (8) by (17) is that t/ must be much smaller than
the inverse mean level distance. Since the energy lev-
els are extremely dense for typical many-body systems,
the approximation applies for all experimentally realis-
tic times t. However, the quasi-periodicities of F (t) for
extremely large t, inherited from φ(t) via (7) and (8),
usually get lost.

Regarding section “Typicality of thermalization”

5. By similar methods as in the derivation of our main
result (13), one can show [11] that for the overwhelming
majority of unitaries U the diagonal matrix elements Ann
remain very close to their mean value [Ann]U = hAiρmc ,
a property also known under the name eigenstate ther-
malization hypothesis (ETH) [12-14]. It is tempting to
argue that a violation of ETH indicates an “untypical”
case and hence also (13) will be violated. However, there
is no reason why the extremely small subset of U ’s which
violate (13) has any relevant overlap with the extremely
small subset of U ’s which violate ETH. In other words, we
expect that equation (13) still applies to the vast major-
ity of ETH-violating systems, i.e., provided their initial
condition ρ(0) is still suﬃciently “typical” to guarantee
thermalization. Numerical examples of such cases are
provided, e.g., by Ref. [15].

Vice versa, the ﬁndings about typicality of ETH and
thermalization from [11,12,16-19] are expected to remain
valid even when (13) is violated (thus including cases
which do not thermalize as rapidly as predicted by (13)).
An analogous consideration applies to the “level pop-
ulations” ρnn(0): They must be negligible outside the
microcanonical energy window [E − ∆E, E], but inside
the window they may still be distributed quite “untypi-
cally”.

6. More abstractly speaking, in order to realize si-
multaneously an untypical U and a far from equilibrium
hAiρ(0), one generally expects that the eigenbases of both
A and ρ(0) must be ﬁne-tuned relatively to a given H.

As a consequence, one expects untypically strong cor-
relations between Ann and ρnn(0) (see also paragraph 3.
above). This is conﬁrmed, e.g., by the numerical exam-
ples in Refs.
[14,20] and is also closely related to the
ideas proposed by Peres in Ref. [21].

7. To further scrutinize the untypical U ’s, we consider
subsets Sa consisting of all U ’s with the extra property
that hAiω = a, where ω is deﬁned below equation (3).
One readily sees that for any given a-value, the set Sa still
entails the necessary symmetries so that equations (2)-
(8) remain valid when re-deﬁning [· · ·]U as the restricted
average over all U ∈ Sa. On the other hand, equation
(9) is replaced by hAiρav = a, implied by hAiω = a for
all U ∈ Sa. Finally, one expects, analogously as in equa-
tions (10)-(12), that the ﬂuctuations about the average
behavior are typically small for most U ∈ Sa. While a
rigorous proof seems very diﬃcult, the intuitive argument
is that the subset Sa can be represented as a manifold
of fantastically large dimensionality (just one dimension
less that for the unrestricted set of all U ’s due to the
extra constraint hAiω = a). Hence, a similar concentra-
tion of measure phenomenon is expected in both cases.
Analogously as in (13), the overall conclusion is that

hAiρ(t) = a + F (t) (cid:8)hAiρ(0) − a(cid:9)

should be satisﬁed in very good approximation for the
vast majority of all times t and unitaries U ∈ Sa. Upon

15

comparison with (13) one sees that if a notably diﬀers
from hAiρmc then most U ∈ Sa are untypical. On the
other hand, any given untypical U is contained in one of
the subsets Sa and is thus generically expected to satisfy
the above approximation. Remarkably, the time depen-
dence is governed by the same function F (t) for all a.

These considerations justify our comparison of the the-
ory (in the above generalized version) with the integrable
model in Fig. 4. In turn, the good agreement with the
numerical results in Fig. 4 supports the above arguments.
