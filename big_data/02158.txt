We introduce a 3–parameter class of maps (1) acting on a bipartite system that are a natural
generalisation of the depolarizing channel (and include it as a special case). Then, we ﬁnd the
exact regions of the parameter space that alternatively determine a positive, completely positive,
entanglement–breaking or entanglement–annihilating map. This model displays a much richer be-
haviour than the one shown by a simple depolarizing channel, yet it stays exactly solvable. As an
example of this richness, PPT but not entanglement–breaking maps are found in Theorem 2. A
simple example of a positive yet indecomposable map is provided (see the Remark at the end of
Section IV). The study of the entanglement–annihilating property is fully addressed by Theorem
7. Finally, we apply our results to solve the problem of the entanglement annihilation caused in a
bipartite system by a tensor product of local depolarizing channels. In this context, a conjecture
posed in [17] is aﬃrmatively answered, and the gaps that the imperfect bounds of [16] left open are
closed. To arrive at this result we furthermore show how the Hadamard product between quantum
states can be implemented via local operations.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Entanglement appears as the central pillar of almost every quantum communication protocol [1]. It is however a
very fragile resource and once distributed, the local participants in any kind of communication protocol can never
increase it via local operations, even if aided by unbounded classical communication (these operations are abbreviated
under the acronym LOCC). Much eﬀort has thus been invested into characterizing the resource of entanglement [2, 3].
It is in general an NP-hard problem to decide whether a given quantum state exhibits entanglement at all [4], even
if the full state is known with perfect precision. This precludes a complete characterization of all aspects in full
generality, but nonetheless some paradigmatic cases can be resolved in a practically useful way. Complete solutions
for the separability problem exist for various special classes of states [5–13] and through mapping arbitrary states
into these classes one can get useful bounds for general states. A central tool for addressing these problems are
positive maps, the canonical example being transposition, from which the probably most widely used entanglement
test derives [14]. Apart from quantifying [3] and detecting entanglement [15], another important problem concerns
the transformation of entanglement.

In general, any physical transformation of a quantum system can be represented by a completely positive (CP)
map. Studying which CP maps preserve and more importantly which maps adversely aﬀect entanglement is of great
importance to understanding the limitations of sending quantum states through diﬀerent channels. Two important
examples are maps that break the entanglement between two quantum systems (entanglement–annihilating) and
between a single quantum system and the rest of the world (entanglement–breaking).
Among the most signiﬁcant quantum channel we can undoubtedly include the depolarizing channel, deﬁned on a
d–dimensional system by the formula ∆λ ≡ λI + (1 − λ) 1
d Tr . Its usefulness is twofold: on the one hand, it represents
a physically meaningful model of the white noise acting on an isolated system; on the other hand, it constitutes a
mathematically treatable yet nontrivial example of quantum channel. We remind the reader [6] that the map ∆λ is:

d−1 ≤ λ ≤ 1;

d2−1 ≤ λ ≤ 1;

• positive iﬀ − 1
• completely positive (CP) iﬀ − 1
• completely copositive (coCP) iﬀ − 1
• entanglement–breaking iﬀ it is at the same time CP and coCP, iﬀ − 1

d−1 ≤ λ ≤ 1
d+1 ;

d2−1 ≤ λ ≤ 1
d+1 .

In particular, it is useful to remember that whenever ∆λ is positive it is also either completely positive or completely
copositive (or both). These facts are used several times in the rest of the paper.

In this manuscript we study a three–parameter class of maps that generalises the depolarizing channel, one of the
most studied transformations in the context of noisy communication. Despite the richer structure that class displays,
we present an exact solution in terms of all parameters α, β, γ for which this map is positive; completely positive;
entanglement–breaking and entanglement–annihilating. This characterization includes a new example of a positive
map, which is not decomposable, i.e. capable of detecting entangled states which remain positive under partial

2

transposition (PPT). To arrive at this map we point out a physically interesting Lemma: The Hadamard product
between two arbitrary quantum states can be stochastically implemented via LOCC.

As an application of the entanglement–annihilating characterization, we answer some open questions recently raised
in [16, 17] concerning the minimum amount of local depolarizing noise leading to a global entanglement annihilation
when applied on both sides of a bipartite system.

To start, let us consider the following maps acting on a bipartite system AB:

Φ[α, β, γ] ≡ 1ABTr + α 1ATr ⊗ I + β I ⊗ 1BTr + γ I .

(1)

As a ﬁrst remark, one could wish to consider a more general linear combination than (1), with another parameter
for the coeﬃcient of 1ABTr . However, already the positivity condition easily implies that such a parameter must be
non–negative. Up to a normalization constant, one can take it to be either 1 or 0. The latter case can be deduced
from the former, because α 1ATr ⊗ I + β I ⊗ 1BTr + γ I is positive iﬀ 1
1ABTr + α 1ATr ⊗ I + β I ⊗ 1BTr + γ I
is positive for all M > 0, iﬀ Φ[M α, M β, M γ] is positive for all M > 0.

M

Observe that the maps Φ we deﬁned commute with all the local unitary conjugations. But there is more: up to
including a coeﬃcient for the ﬁrst addend (which is an irrelevant modiﬁcations in the sense clariﬁed above), these
maps are all the maps on AB displaying this feature, as the following reasoning shows. Before going into the details,
we remind the reader that the states of a bipartite system AA(cid:48) commuting with all the conjugations by local unitaries
of the form UA ⊗ U∗
A(cid:48) are exactly the linear combinations of the identity 1AA(cid:48) and the maximally entangled state
|ε(cid:105)(cid:104)ε|AA(cid:48). Now, up the application of the Choi–Jamiolkowski isomorphism, we have to prove that the set of ABA(cid:48)B(cid:48)
states that commute with conjugations by UA ⊗ VB ⊗ U∗
B(cid:48) coincides with the set of linear combinations of
1ABA(cid:48)B(cid:48), 1AA(cid:48) ⊗|ε(cid:105)(cid:104)ε|BB(cid:48), |ε(cid:105)(cid:104)ε|AA(cid:48)⊗ 1BB(cid:48), and |ε(cid:105)(cid:104)ε|AA(cid:48)⊗|ε(cid:105)(cid:104)ε|BB(cid:48), i.e. with the tensor product of the two locally
invariant subspaces of AA(cid:48) and BB. This is nothing but a particular instance of a more general phenomenon: given
two representations of compact groups ζi : Gi → GL(Vi) (with i = 1, 2), the invariant subspace of the external tensor
product ζ1 (cid:2) ζ2 is the tensor product of the two ζi–invariant subspaces; in fact, the latter is trivially contained in the
former, while at the same time the dimensions are equal, thanks to character theory:

A(cid:48) ⊗ V ∗

(cid:104)χ1, χζ1(cid:2)ζ2(cid:105) =

dg1dg2 Tr [(ζ1 ⊗ ζ2) (g1, g2)] =

dg1dg2 Tr ζ1(g1) Tr ζ2(g2) = (cid:104)χ1, χζ1(cid:105) (cid:104)χ1, χζ2(cid:105) .

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

In our case, the two groups are G1 = SU (dA) and G2 = SU (dB), the two spaces are the set of hermitian operators on
AA(cid:48) and BB(cid:48), while the representations are deﬁned through ζ1(U )(XAA(cid:48)) = UA⊗U∗
A(cid:48) and analogously
for BB(cid:48).
Note that for dA = dB the separability properties of the Choi states corresponding to (1) have been already considered
in [18]. In that paper, the entanglement–breaking conditions for (1) were found under the above simplifying assumption
dA = dB. However, we will see that the general case dA (cid:54)= dB is way more interesting, because new phenomena such
as the existence of PPT entangled states appear.
As usual, we will denote by n the minimum between the two local dimensions dA, dB, i.e. the maximum Schmidt rank
of a global pure state. A trick that turns out to be useful in analysing the above Φ[α, β, γ] requires the construction
of the following family of maps acting on an n–dimensional system:

where D is the projection onto the diagonal, i.e. D(X) = 1 ◦ X and the symbol ◦ denotes the Hadamard product.

χ[a, c] ≡ 1nTr + a D + c I ,

Observation 1: The Hadamard Product

The element-wise product between two bipartite density matrices ρAB and σAB can be stochastically imple-
mented via local operations and classical communication in the following way:
AA(cid:48) ⊗ Π0

where Π0
BB(cid:48). A trivial consequence of this observation is the fact
that the Hadamard product between separable states written in a local basis is again separable. In appendix
A, we point out several other properties of the Hadamard product, which we believe are of interest for future
research, although they are not directly used in this paper.

II. POSITIVITY

3

The most direct determination of the positivity region of Φ[α, β, γ] is contained in the proof of Theorem 3. However,
we will initially follow a longer path to the main result, passing through Proposition 1 and Theorem 2. This is
instructive because it shows the link between Φ and χ and leads to nice geometrical intuitions. The ﬁrst important
observation we present is indeed the reduction of the problem of positivity for Φ[α, β, γ] to the analogous problem for
χ[a, c].
Proposition 1. The map Φ[α, β, γ] is positive iﬀ α, β ≥ −1 and χ[α + β, γ] is positive.
Proof. Clearly, in order to ensure the positivity of Φ (parameters are understood for brevity) we have to require that
Φ(|Ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)Ψ|) ≥ 0 for all global pure states |Ψ(cid:105). Since Φ commutes with the conjugation by local unitaries, we can suppose
that the input state is in Schmidt normal form, i.e.

|Ψ(cid:105) =

λi |ii(cid:105) .

Then,

(1 + (α + β)λi) δij + γ(cid:112)λiλj

(cid:17)|ii(cid:105)(cid:104)jj| .

(4)

(5)

From the above block decomposition it is apparent that Φ(|Ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)Ψ|) ≥ 0 iﬀ 1 + αλj + βλi ≥ 0 and

(1 + (α + β)λi) δij + γ(cid:112)λiλj

(cid:17)|i(cid:105)(cid:104)j| ≥ 0 .

Once we require the validity of these conditions for all the probability distributions λ, the ﬁrst one reads α, β ≥ −1.
At the same time, the above matrix is exactly

λi |i(cid:105), and therefore we are led to require the positivity of the map χ[α + β, γ] as the second and last

χ[α + β, γ] (|ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ|) ,

√

i

with |ψ(cid:105) ≡(cid:80)

condition.

The above proposition reduces our main problem to the question of determining what is the region of positivity of

the map (2). Now, we proceed to show how to solve this latter problem.

Theorem 2. The map χ[a, c] deﬁned by (2) is positive iﬀ

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that a ≥ 0. Denoting with Dλ the diagonal matrix with diagonal λ ∈ Rn, the positivity of χ[a, c]
amounts to require that

1 + a Dλ + c |ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ| ≥ 0

∀ |ψ(cid:105) =

(phases are irrelevant, as the application of a diagonal unitary immediately reveals). Since 1 + a Dλ > 0, after left–
and right– multiplying by (1 + aDλ)1/2 the above inequality reads also
−1/2 |ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ| (1 + aDλ)

1 + c (1 + aDλ)

−1/2 ≥ 0 ,

that in turn becomes

(cid:104)ψ| (1 + aDλ)

−1 |ψ(cid:105) + c

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:104)ψ| (1 + aDλ)

−1 |ψ(cid:105)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)2 ≥ 0 ,

eventually leading to

i.e.

1 + c (cid:104)ψ| (1 + aDλ)

−1 |ψ(cid:105) ≥ 0 ,

as stated in (6) for the present case a ≥ 0. Now, let us consider the opposite possibility, a < 0. Since the diagonal
entries of the operator in (7) are 1 + (a + c)λi, imposing their positivity for all the allowed λ amounts to require that
a + c + 1 ≥ 0. Moreover, observe that if a < −2 it is possible to force 1 + aDλ to have a 2–dimensional negative
eigenspace. In this case, an addition of pure state could not make the whole operator positive. Therefore, we have to
demand a ≥ −2. In order to show that these two conditions are suﬃcient, consider an arbitrary pure state |v(cid:105) and
take the matrix element of (7) on it.

In order to prove that the above quantity is always positive if a ≥ −2 and a + c + 1 ≥ 0, we want to formalize the
following intuition. On the one hand, it is not possible to make the coeﬃcient of c small without choosing at least
two non–zero (and comparable) vi, thus reducing the negative impact of the coeﬃcient of a. On the other hand, if
one wants to concentrate the weights
λivi on a single element, then a appears always summed with c. Let us make
the above reasoning rigorous by considering the following geometric inequality, valid for arbitrary z1, . . . , zn ∈ C:

Remark. It is also possible to give a direct proof of the positivity of χ[a, c] when −2 ≤ a ≤ 0, 1 + a + c ≥ 0, based on
Hadamard product arguments. Clearly, up to taking convex combinations with known positive maps, one has to prove
only the positivity of the extreme point χ[−2, 1] = 1Tr − 2D + I. Then, the crucial observation consists in writing
◦2, where the basis we
the above map as a Hadamard square of a completely copositive map, i.e. χ[−2, 1] = (1Tr − I)
choose from now on to take Hadamard products is the canonical basis of operators {|i(cid:105)(cid:104)j|}i,j (or its Choi–Jamiolkowski
equivalent {|ij(cid:105)}i,j). The following reasoning then shows that Hadamard multiplying two completely copositive maps
yields another completely copositive map. Denoting with Rφ ≡ (φ ⊗ I)(|ε(cid:105)(cid:104)ε|) the Choi state of φ, one has in fact

Putting together Proposition 1 and Theorem 2 allows us to conclude that Φ[α, β, γ] is a positive map iﬀ α, β ≥ −1
and a = α + β, c = γ satisfy (6). A graphical representation of the region determined by these conditions is given in
Figure 1.

FIG. 1. The solid region represents the parameter region for which the map Φ[α, β, γ] of (1) is not positive. Here the the n = 4
case is considered.

However, we want to give a simpler and more direct deduction of the positivity conditions for Φ, as formalized

below.

Theorem 3. The map Φ[α, β, γ] deﬁned by (1) is positive iﬀ:

(cid:40) γ + α+β

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

α, β ≥ −1

and

n + 1 ≥ 0
α + β + γ + 1 ≥ 0

if α + β ≥ 0 ,

if α + β < 0 .

(10)

Alternative proof. First of all, the above conditions are necessary, as can be seen by choosing suitable input states.

• A maximally entangled state |ε(cid:105) gives Φ(|ε(cid:105)(cid:104)ε|) =
n +γ ≥ 0 follows.
• A product state |11(cid:105) gives Φ(|11(cid:105)(cid:104)11|) = 1 + α 1⊗|1(cid:105)(cid:104)1| + β |1(cid:105)(cid:104)1|⊗ 1 + γ |11(cid:105)(cid:104)11| ≥ 0. Taking the matrix element

1+γ |ε(cid:105)(cid:104)ε| ≥ 0, from which 1+ α+β

1 + α+β
n

on the same state produces 1 + α + β + γ ≥ 0.

-1012-1012-2-1012positivity6
• As above, input |11(cid:105) but take the matrix element on pure states |21(cid:105) and |12(cid:105), producing the condition 1 + α ≥ 0

and 1 + β ≥ 0.

Moreover, observe that if α + β ≥ 0 the second condition is subsumed under the ﬁrst one (while the others are trivial),
while on the contrary if α + β < 0 the ﬁrst condition is subsumed under the second one. This completes the proof of
the necessity of the inequalities (10).

In order to prove their suﬃciency, observe the region that they determine in Figure 1. It is apparent that every

point belonging to that region is a convex combination of three points on the three following half–lines:

• the vertical one, at the intersection between the αγ and βγ coordinate planes, { (−1,−1, γ) : γ ≥ 1} ;
• the lower one running parallel to the βγ plane, { (−1, β,−1 − β−1
• the lower one running parallel to the αγ plane, { (α,−1,−1 − α−1

n ) : β ≥ 1} ;
n ) : α ≥ 1} .

If we prove that all of the above half–lines are entirely composed of positive maps, we are done. Let us proceed in
the same order.

• Φ(cid:2) − 1, β,−1 − β−1

• Φ[−1,−1, γ] = (1Tr − I) ⊗ (1Tr − I) + (γ − 1)I is positive if γ ≥ 1, because the ﬁrst addend is the tensor
product of two completely copositive maps! In other words, up to composing with a global transposition (that
is positive and invertible), it is nothing but the product of two completely positive maps.

(cid:3) = (1Tr + I) ⊗ (1Tr − I) + (β − 1) I ⊗(cid:0)1Tr − 1
n = dA (equivalently, one can see directly that I ⊗(cid:0)1Tr − 1

n I(cid:1) is positive if β ≥ 1, because:
n I(cid:1) is positive by testing it on a pure state).

subsystem and a positive map on the second subsystem;

– the ﬁrst addend is positive since it is a tensor product of an entanglement–breaking channel on the ﬁrst
– the second addend is positive because 1BTr − I

n is completely positive if n = dB and at least n–positive if

• The third case is completely analogous to the second one and can be treated in a symmetrically identical way.

III. COMPLETE POSITIVITY

Determining the range of α, β, γ for which the map Φ[α, β, γ] given by (1) is completely positive requires the
construction of the Choi state associated to Φ. Calling A(cid:48)B(cid:48) the twin system of AB, a maximally entangled state
reads

|E(cid:105)ABA(cid:48)B(cid:48) =

1√
dAdB

|ij(cid:105)AB |ij(cid:105)A(cid:48)B(cid:48) = |ε(cid:105)AB |ε(cid:105)A(cid:48)B(cid:48)

.

(cid:88)

ij

As a consequence, the Choi state becomes
RΦ ≡ (ΦAB ⊗IA(cid:48)B(cid:48)) (|E(cid:105)(cid:104)E|ABA(cid:48)B(cid:48)) =

+ γ |ε(cid:105)(cid:104)ε|AA(cid:48) ⊗|ε(cid:105)(cid:104)ε|BB(cid:48) .
(11)
Since the four addends appearing in the above equation commute, the diagonalization of their sum is straightforward.
It is easily seen that the distinct eigenvalues of the operator in (11) are

⊗|ε(cid:105)(cid:104)ε|BB(cid:48) + β |ε(cid:105)(cid:104)ε|AA(cid:48) ⊗ 1BB(cid:48)

IV. ENTANGLEMENT–BREAKING

The goal of the present section is to answer the question of what is the region in the α, β, γ parameter space
that deﬁnes an entanglement–breaking map through equation (1). Obviously, such a region must be contained in
the complete positivity solid deﬁned via (12). Reformulating the problem with the help of the Choi–Jamiolkowski
isomorphism, we want to determine necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the separability of the state (11). This
problem has already been solved in the special case dA = dB in [18], but we will see that the most interesting
phenomena appear when one considers the asymmetric case dA (cid:54)= dB.

We will prove the main theorem in two diﬀerent ways. The ﬁrst approach (perhaps more elegant, though less direct)
employs a provably suﬃcient set of entanglement witnesses to decide the separability of a state. The second one,
instead, uses some positive maps to ﬁnd necessary conditions for separability, that are then found to be also suﬃcient
by direct construction.

An important observation (that we explain in the box below) exploits the symmetries of our problem to connect
this separability question to the problem of testing witnesses belonging to the same symmetric class, i.e. the positive
maps given by Theorem 3. In what follows, the symbol CP will stand for the set of completely positive maps (the
system they are acting on being understood), while T will denote the transposition map, as usual.

Theorem 5. If dA = dB then the map Φ[α, β, γ] deﬁned by (1) is entanglement–breaking iﬀ it is completely positive
and PPT. If dA < dB, it is entanglement–breaking iﬀ

Observation 2: Separability and Witnesses

States which are invariant under a local group action are known to exhibit simpliﬁed entanglement properties,
whose elementary proofs can be found in Appendix B. Here, we just brieﬂy review some of the most important

ones. Consider two representations ϕ1 : G → L(cid:0)H(n; C)(cid:1) and ϕ2 : G → L(cid:0)H(m; C)(cid:1) of a compact group G on

the local spaces of hermitian matrices. Then, the associated projection is

(cid:90)

G

PG =

dg ϕ1(g) ⊗ ϕ2(g) ,

where (cid:82)

G dg is the Haar integral. When acting on a bipartite operator, this projection outputs always a
(G ⊗ G)–invariant state. Moreover, positivity and separability are preserved under the action of the above
superoperator. We remind the reader that in general the Woronowicz criterion states that ρ is separable iﬀ
Tr ρW ≥ 0 for all the operators W such that Tr σW ≥ 0 for any separable σ (such a W is called a separability–
witness). When there is a local group action, thanks ultimately to the separability–preserving properties of
the group projection, it is possible to give a relaxed version of the above criterion. Namely, a (G ⊗G)–invariant
state ρ is separable iﬀ Tr ρW ≥ 0 for all (G ⊗ G)–invariant separability witnesses W .

Proof. As is well known, Φ is entanglement–breaking iﬀ its Choi state RΦ (see (11)) is separable. The symmetrized
version of the Woronowicz criterion we just discussed states that this happens iﬀ Tr W RΦ ≥ 0 for all the separability–
witnesses W that share the same symmetry. In other words, W can be assumed to be the Choi matrix of a positive
map Φ(cid:48) ≡ Φ[α(cid:48), β(cid:48), γ(cid:48)] belonging to the set deﬁned by (1) (or a limit point of the form limM→∞ 1
M Φ[M α(cid:48), M β(cid:48), M γ(cid:48)],
with (M α(cid:48), M β(cid:48), M γ(cid:48)) deﬁning a positive map for all M > 0, as explained in Section I; this case will not be considered
further because it does not introduce any new constraint). It is understood that all the operators here act on ABA(cid:48)B(cid:48),
and that the separability problem is with respect to the AB|A(cid:48)B(cid:48) cut.

Instead of requiring the scalar condition Tr RΦ(cid:48)RΦ ≥ 0 for all positive Φ(cid:48), one can write

Tr RΦ(cid:48)RΦ = (cid:104)E| R(Φ(cid:48))T Φ |E(cid:105) = (cid:104)E| RΦ(cid:48)Φ |E(cid:105)

and move directly to Φ(cid:48)Φ ∈ CP for all positive Φ(cid:48). In fact, on the one hand the latter is at least as powerful as the
former, while on the other hand the former implies that Φ is entanglement–breaking, that in turn implies Φ(cid:48)Φ ∈ CP
for all positive Φ(cid:48).
From now on, we assume without loss of generality dA ≤ dB. As detailed in the proof of Theorem 3, all the positive

8

maps in the region deﬁned by 1 can be written as a convex combination of:

1. Φ[−1,−1, γ] = (1Tr − I) ⊗ (1Tr − I) + (γ − 1)I for some γ ≥ 1;

2. Φ(cid:2) − 1, β,−1 − β−1
3. Φ(cid:2)α,−1,−1 − α−1

(cid:3) = (1Tr + I) ⊗ (1Tr − I) + (β − 1) I ⊗(cid:0)1Tr − 1
(cid:3) = (1Tr − I) ⊗ (1Tr + I) + (α − 1)(cid:0)1Tr − 1

I(cid:1) for some β ≥ 1;
I(cid:1) ⊗ I for some α ≥ 1.

Consequently, it suﬃces to test the above three families of witnesses Φ(cid:48). For each family with parameter x (x = γ, β, α
in order), up to taking ﬁrst the case x = 1 and then the limit x → ∞, this is the same as testing the two addends
separately. Now, we want to understand which one of the above six tests (two for each one of the three families) can
be subsumed under the PPT condition T Φ ∈ CP. This happens when the witness is decomposable, i.e. it is a positive
combination of a CP and a coCP map.

1b. I is obviously completely positive.

actually indecomposable whenever dA (cid:54)= dB; for the time being, all we can conclude is that we can not a priori
discard this test.

I(cid:1) is only positive but not completely positive unless dA = dB; it will be clear later that it is
I(cid:1) ⊗ I is not the same as 2b, because the condition dA ≤ dB ensures that 1Tr − 1

I, and thus the

entire map, are completely positive.

From the above discussion it should be clear that if dA = dB then the PPT test is both necessary and suﬃcient to
ensure that Φ is entanglement–breaking, while if dA < dB the only condition that can not be absorbed in the PPT
test is the one in 2b. This is the same as saying that for dA < dB a map Φ of the class in (1) is entanglement–breaking
iﬀ:

(cid:16)

• T Φ is completely positive;
• and

Φ is completely positive.

Now that necessary and suﬃcient conditions for Φ to be entanglement–breaking have been written down in the
form (13), it is only a matter of ﬁnding out the shape of the corresponding solid. An interesting question, as usual, is
whether we really need the second test or on the contrary the PPT condition is actually suﬃcient. We already saw
that the suspected answer is that if dA < dB we do need the second test. In other words, in that case there are PPT
entangled states of the form (11).

• Φ ∈ CP. This gives the two conditions on the ﬁrst line together with the requirement β ≥ −1/dA. However, the
latter can be neglected because it follows from the other inequalities of the system (14). Indeed, multiplying the
second inequality of the ﬁrst line by (dB − dA)/dB and summing the third line produces exactly dAβ + 1 ≥ 0.
• T Φ ∈ CP. Taking the partial transposition TA(cid:48)B(cid:48) of the Choi state (11) gives

dAdB (ΦAB ⊗ TA(cid:48)B(cid:48)) (|E(cid:105)(cid:104)E|ABA(cid:48)B(cid:48)) = 1ABA(cid:48)B(cid:48) + α 1AA(cid:48) ⊗ SBB(cid:48) + β SAA(cid:48) ⊗ 1BB(cid:48) + γ SAA(cid:48) ⊗ SBB(cid:48),

where S indicates the swap operator between two subsystems. Since the four addends in the above equation
commute, ﬁnding the eigenvalues of their sum is straightforward: they are given by 1 + α + β + γ, 1 + α − β −
γ, 1− α + β − γ, 1− α− β + γ. As is easy to see, 1 + α + β + γ ≥ 0 is already implied by the complete positivity
conditions; in fact, using the second inequality of the ﬁrst line to lower bound γ gives

The shape of the solid deﬁned by (14) can be seen in Figure 2. Finding the vertices is now an elementary exercise.

Alternative proof.
It is also possible to give a more direct proof of Theorem 6, consisting in ﬁnding explicitly separable expressions for
the vertices of the solid deﬁned by (14) and represented in Figure 2. Before entering into the details, we remind the
reader that for a bipartite system AA(cid:48) (with dA = dA(cid:48)) the isotropic separability–preserving projection acts as

PAA(cid:48)(·) ≡

(15)
where |ε(cid:105) is a maximally entangled state across AA(cid:48). Another fact coming from the theory of isotropic states is that

are entanglement–breaking maps when acting on a d–dimensional system.

Now we are ready to prove that each of the vertices of the double pyramid of Figure 2 corresponds to an
entanglement–breaking map (or, equivalently, to a separable Choi operator (11)). Only one of the ﬁve vertices requires
a special treatment, while the remaining four are easily seen to correspond to products of entanglement–breaking maps
on A and B and therefore to entanglement–breaking maps on AB.

Since the right–hand side consist of the application to a AB|A(cid:48)B(cid:48)–separable state of a map that preserves
separability with respect to every cut, we must conclude that the left–hand side is indeed separable.

FIG. 2. The three planes identify the complete positivity region for the maps deﬁned in (1) in the α, β, γ space. Inside that,
the entanglement–breaking solid (in green) is shown on the left. On the right, we added the pyramid for which this map is
PPT but not entanglement–breaking (in red). Such a region exists iﬀ dA (cid:54)= dB; here we chose the case dA = 2, dB = 6.

Remark. Several facts of independent interest can be deduced from the above discussion. Let us recall some of them.

• The state

RABA(cid:48)B(cid:48) ≡ 1ABA(cid:48)B(cid:48) − 1AA(cid:48) ⊗ |ε(cid:105)(cid:104)ε|BB(cid:48) − |ε(cid:105)(cid:104)ε|AA(cid:48) ⊗ 1BB(cid:48) + (dAdB − dB + dA) |ε(cid:105)(cid:104)ε|AA(cid:48) ⊗ |ε(cid:105)(cid:104)ε|BB(cid:48) , (16)
corresponding to the vertex of the PPT entangled pyramid depicted in red on the right of Figure 2, is a PPT
entangled state of the bipartite system AB|A(cid:48)B(cid:48).
• If dA < dB, the map IA ⊗ (1Tr − I/dA)B acting on a bipartite system AB is positive but indecomposable, as
can be seen by noting that it detects the PPT entangled state RABA(cid:48)B(cid:48) deﬁned by (16). To the extent of our
knowledge, this remarkable fact has not been pointed out before.

is entanglement–breaking when acting on a bipartite system AB such that dA ≤ dB.

V. ENTANGLEMENT–ANNIHILATING

An entanglement–annihilating map (see [16, 17, 19, 20]) is a positive map ΞAB acting on a bipartite system AB
such that ΞAB(RAB) is a separable state for every input state RAB (as can be easily seen, it suﬃces to choose pure
input states). Observe that this has nothing to do with the notion of entanglement–breaking. While the latter is a
completely positive map that always breaks the entanglement between AB as a whole and the external world, the
former simply breaks the internal entanglement between A and B. As extreme examples, on the one hand take the
channel |ε(cid:105)(cid:104)ε|AB Tr acting on a bipartite system AB such that dA = dB. Obviously, such a channel is entanglement–
breaking (because it involves tracing away the whole state) but not entanglement–annihilating (because the output
state is entangled). On the other hand, consider the map 1ABTr − IAB, that is entanglement–annihilating on AB
without even being completely positive. The former observation follows from the fact that 1 − |Ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)Ψ| is separable for
all pure states |Ψ(cid:105), as it belongs to the Gurvits and Barnum separable ball around the identity [21].

Throughout this section, we want to study the region in the α, β, γ space such that the corresponding map deﬁned
by (1) is entanglement–annihilating. Obviously, there is a naive necessary criterion that must be satisﬁed: if ΦAB has

-1012-1012-2-1012completepositivityentanglement breaking-1012-1012-2-1012positivityPPTentanglement breakingcomplete12
to be entanglement–annihilating, then (IA ⊗ TB) ΦAB must be positive (TB denotes partial transposition). Maps for
which the latter condition holds are called PPT–inducing in [17].

Theorem 7. Given a map Φ[α, β, γ] deﬁned by (1), the following are equivalent:

1. Φ is is entanglement–annihilating ;

2. Φ is positive and PPT–inducing;
3. Φ is positive and in addition γ ≤ α + β + 2;
4. α, β ≥ −1, γ + α+β

n + 1 ≥ 0, α + β + γ + 1 ≥ 0 and γ ≤ α + β + 2.

Proof.
Let us prove the various implications one by one.

1. ⇒ 2. We already saw that an entanglement–annihilating map is necessarily PPT–inducing (and obviously positive).
2. ⇒ 3. Input to Φ the pure state |Ψ(cid:105) =

; the positivity of the partial transpose of the resulting state requires

|11(cid:105)+|22(cid:105)√

γ ≤ α + β + 2.

2

3. ⇒ 4. Trivially obtained by using Theorem 3. The region identiﬁed by these conditions is represented in Figure 3.
4. ⇒ 1. As one could expect, this is the only point that requires a bit of care. Observing Figure 3, we note that every
point of the positive and PPT–inducing region is a convex combination of four points on the four half–lines
forming the edges of the set. If we prove that all these four half–lines are composed entirely of entanglement–
annihilating maps, we are done.

– The two lower half–lines have already been studied in the proof of Theorem 3. The one on the right of

Figure 3 is composed of maps of the form

(cid:20)
−1, β, −1 − β − 1

(cid:21)

Φ

n

with β ≥ 1. Both of the addends of the above equation are entanglement–annihilating, because they are
tensor products of a positive and an entanglement–breaking map on the two subsystems. Consequently,
their sum is entanglement–annihilating as well. The same reasoning applies to the other lower half–line,

that is symmetrically composed of maps of the form Φ(cid:2)α,−1,−1 − α−1

– The two upper half–lines of Figure 3 are again symmetrically related and can be treated in the same way.

The one on the right, for instance, is composed of maps of the form

Remark. We found particularly surprising that the state 2 1 − 2 1 ⊗ ρΨ − ρΨ ⊗ 1 + |Ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)Ψ| is separable for all the
global pure states |Ψ(cid:105), especially because of the techniques we employed to prove this fact. We will see in a moment
that besides being interesting in itself, is also useful in closing some open problems recently raised in the literature.

VI. APPLICATIONS

Throughout this section, we apply the results in Section V to solve some open problems recently posed in [16, 17].
In those papers, the scenario in which a depolarizing channel acts locally on each (equal) side of a bipartite quantum
system is considered. More speciﬁcally, using the notation ∆q = qI + (1 − q) 1
d2−1 ≤ q ≤ 1, it is asked
what is the condition on q1, q2 under which ∆q1 ⊗ ∆q2 becomes entanglement–annihilating. In [16] (see equation (5)),
a suﬃcient condition is found, that reads

d Tr with − 1

In particular, for the symmetric case q1 = q2 = q, the explicit form

(d2 − 1)q1q2 ≤ 1 +

is deduced from (18). At the same time, the condition

(20)
is shown to be necessary in order for ∆q ⊗ ∆q to be PPT–inducing. In [17] it is also conjectured, that (20) is also
suﬃcient for enforcing the PPT–inducing behaviour (if the q range is restricted to the complete positivity interval).
Observe that:

FIG. 3. The convex region outside of the solid represents the parameter range for which the channel (1) is entanglement–
annihilating. Here the case n = 4 is shown. Compare with Figure 1 and note the extra plane on the top identifying the
additional condition γ ≤ α + β + 2.

i) there is a gap between the region (19) in which the entanglement annihilation is guaranteed and the region (20)

outside which the global map is not even PPT–inducing;

ii) in [17] it is conjectured that inside that gap the map is still PPT–inducing, while no supposition is made about

the entanglement annihilation.

Applying Theorem 7 straightforwardly solves all these problems, showing that (20) is indeed a necessary and suﬃ-
cient condition for the map ∆q ⊗ ∆q to be PPT–inducing or, equivalently, entanglement–annihilating. In particular,
this proves the conjecture in [17]. Before discussing the details of the above solution, we stress that it is not necessary
to assume the complete positivity of the local maps (as done in both [16] and [17]) in order for our problem to make
sense. On the contrary, it is enough to demand that the product ∆q1 ⊗ ∆q2 is positive. Remarkably, this is the case
iﬀ the two local maps are themselves positive, because in that case they are either completely positive or completely
copositive (or both). The local positivity conditions read

− 1

d − 1

≤ q1, q2 ≤ 1 .

By comparison, remind that the complete positivity conditions are

− 1

d2 − 1

≤ q1, q2 ≤ 1 .

Now, we are in position to show our solution to the aforementioned open questions.
Corollary 8. The product ∆q1 ⊗ ∆q2 of local depolarizing maps is entanglement–annihilating if and only if, besides
the positivity conditions, the inequality

holds. In the symmetric case q1 = q2 = q, (21) becomes simply

Proof. We can apply Theorem 7 in the form of condition 3. As already observed, the product ∆q1 ⊗ ∆q2 is always
positive when the two local maps are positive. Therefore, writing

which becomes (21) after elementary algebraic manipulations. Deducing (22) is now a simple exercise. Observe that
the lower bound on q expressed by (22) is superﬂuous if the complete positivity condition is imposed (and in that
case we end up with (20)), but must be retained if only the positivity is imposed.

We want to answer another question that is left open in [16]. Besides the local depolarizing noise, in that paper a

It is very simple to observe that ∆AB

d2+2 (1Tr + 2I) is already entanglement–annihilating, indeed. This
follows easily from Theorem 7, but is also a consequence of the well–known fact [22] that 1 + 2ρ is separable for all
normalized density matrices ρ on a bipartite system.

2/(d2+2) = 1

VII. CONCLUSION

This concludes the characterization of the extended depolarizing channel. As we have shown, this natural gen-
eralisation to bipartite systems of the paradigmatic noisy channel displays a rich structure that nonetheless admits
analytical solutions. Besides explicitly working out the parameter regions for which the channel is positive, com-
pletely positive, entanglement–breaking and entanglement–annihilating, we have furthermore provided an example of
a positive indecomposable map, constructed a notable entanglement–annihilating map and solved some outstanding
problems in entanglement annihilation. Along the proofs we make some detailed observations on the Hadamard
product and the features that the separability problem exhibits in the presence of a symmetry.

The maps we consider naturally emerge in situations where two separate systems are subject to white noise and
thus provide a useful tool in predicting the physical impact of noise on entanglement. Furthermore they provide new
ways to reveal bound entanglement and an analytical characterization of entanglement for a natural class of states.
We hope that the observations we point out elucidate certain facts in a way that is useful also for future applications.
The solution of the depolarizing channel now provides a promising basis for studying natural generalisations. First of
all one should look at straightforward extensions to the multipartite case, which will involve many more parameters,
but keep the local unitary symmetries (in fact the number of parameters scales exponentially in the number of parties
only). Another potential path to pursue is to study the case of coloured noise. While this would in general lead
to a number of parameters growing in the dimension, thermal noise in equidistant Hamiltonians would still give a
physically important ﬁve parameter family that may yield tractable solutions.

Appendix A: Entanglement–related properties of the Hadamard product

In general, the Hadamard product (also called Schur product) between two matrices M and N is just the element–
wise product, that is, (M ◦ N )ij ≡ MijNij. For an introduction to its basic properties, we refer the reader to Chapter
5 of [23]. The main feature of this operation is that the cone of positive matrices is closed with respect to it; in other
words, if M ≥ 0 and N ≥ 0 then M ◦ N ≥ 0 (this is usually called Schur product theorem). Actually, it is easily
veriﬁed that for a given A ≥ 0 the Hadamard channel ζA(·) ≡ A◦ (·) is not only positive but even completely positive.
Thanks to the Schur product theorem, given two quantum states ρ, σ, it makes sense to consider the (unnormalized)
state ρ ◦ σ. We stress that the deﬁnition of Hadamard product is explicitly dependent on the basis we choose to
represent the operators ρ, σ as matrices. As it turns out, if ρAB, σAB are bipartite states and we ﬁx a local basis to
represent them (as we will always do from now on), then the Hadamard product behaves well with respect to the
entanglement properties of the input states. Ultimately, this comes from the fact that ρAB ◦ σAB can be obtained
stochastically from ρAB ⊗ σA(cid:48)B(cid:48) through a local measurement on the bipartite system AA(cid:48)|BB, as (3) shows.

As a ﬁrst observation, we noticed how this implies that Hadamard multiplying two separable states yields another
separable state. However, there are examples of weakly entangled states that can be (stochastically) eﬃciently distilled
by taking Hadamard powers. This holds also in the multipartite setting. For instance, the computation described
in [24] (together with some later results from [12]) shows the existence of (n − 2)–separable n–qubit states having
a genuinely multipartite entangled Hadamard square. As a generalisation of the separability–preserving property of
the Hadamard product, let us analyse the behaviour of the Schmidt rank function SR(·). Clearly, (3) implies that
SR(ρ ◦ σ) ≤ SRAA(cid:48)|BB(cid:48)(ρAB ⊗ σA(cid:48)B(cid:48)) = SR(ρ)SR(σ). Now, we proceed to show that this bound can always be
saturated, as long as it does not conﬂict with the trivial requirements SR(ρAB) ≤ min{dA, dB} ≡ n.

Before coming to the details, we remind the reader of some simple facts.
i) The rank of the n × m Vandermonde matrix Mij = λi

distinct elements among the complex numbers λ1, . . . , λm.

ii) The Schmidt rank of a vector |Z(cid:105) =(cid:80)
|vi(cid:105) =(cid:80)
we deduce that SR(Z) = r whenever |Z(cid:105) =(cid:80)r
in their own local spaces. As a second corollary, observe that SR ((cid:80)

i |vi(cid:105)|wi(cid:105) coincides with the rank of vT w, where v is a matrix deﬁned via
j vij |j(cid:105) for some ﬁxed computational basis, and w is constructed analogously. As a ﬁrst consequence,
i=1 linearly independent families

i=1 |vi(cid:105)|wi(cid:105) with {|vi(cid:105)}r

j is always equal to min{n, k}, where k is the number of

i=1, {|wi(cid:105)}r
i |vi(cid:105)|v∗

i (cid:105)) = rk (v)

Now, consider two positive integers r, s ≤ n. We have to ﬁnd two (pure) states ρ, σ of Schmidt ranks r, s such that
SR(ρ ◦ σ) = min{n, rs}. Choosing a large N ≥ max{n, rs}, we deﬁne ω ≡ e2πi/N . Then, for all 0 ≤ i ≤ r − 1 and
0 ≤ j ≤ s − 1, let us introduce the local (unnormalized) states

|αi(cid:105) ≡ n−1(cid:88)

ωil |l(cid:105) ,

|βj(cid:105) ≡ n−1(cid:88)

i (cid:105) ,

17

|ϕ(cid:105) ≡ s−1(cid:88)

j (cid:105) .

It’s easy to see that {|αi(cid:105)}0≤i≤r−1 and {|βj(cid:105)}0≤j≤s−1 are two linearly independent families, since all the {ωi}r−1
are distinct, as well as all the {ωjr}s−1
j=0. Consequently, we see that SR(|ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ|) = r and SR(|ϕ(cid:105)(cid:104)ϕ|) = s. Taking the
Hadamard product we obtain

i=0

|ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ| ◦ |ϕ(cid:105)(cid:104)ϕ| = |ψ ◦ ϕ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ ◦ ϕ| ,

with

Observe that |αi ◦ βj(cid:105) = (cid:80)

l ω(i+rj)l |l(cid:105); therefore, the Schmidt rank of the above state is equal to the rank of the
n × rs matrix M whose entries are given by Ml,i+rj ≡ ω(i+rj)l. Since this is a Vandermonde matrix with rs distinct
generating numbers, we conclude that rk M = min{rs, n}.

Appendix B: Separability problem in the presence of a symmetry

Throughout this appendix, we point out some facts that have become part of the common knowledge in the
entanglement theory community, and nonetheless we were not able to ﬁnd clearly stated anywhere. We will be
concerned with the behaviour of the separability problem for special classes of states exhibiting certain symmetries.
Some of the ideas we review here can be found also in the discussion at the beginning of Chapter 2 of [26].
First of all, let us ﬁx some notation. The convex cone of separable matrices on a ﬁxed bipartite system will be
denoted by S. The central problem is to answer the separability problem for states belonging to a subspace V of
the global space of bipartite hermitian operators H(nm; C) = H(n; C) ⊗ H(m; C). We shall always have in mind the
paradigmatic example provided by Werner [5], in which V is composed of all the (U ⊗ U )–symmetric operators. A
deﬁnition we ﬁnd clarifying is the following.
Deﬁnition 9. Let V ⊂ H(nm; C) be a subspace. Then W ∈ V is called a V–separability witness if

∀ ρ ∈ S ∩ W ,

Tr ρW ≥ 0 .

A well–known fact in standard convex analysis is that any closed convex set can be obtained as the intersection of
the closed half–spaces containing it. The ﬁrst approach to characterize the convex set S ∩ V could be to apply this
theorem directly after the V–section.
Theorem 10. Let ρ ∈ V be a bipartite state belonging to the subspace V. Then,

ρ is separable ⇐⇒ Tr ρW ≥ 0 ∀ V–separability witness W .

Observe that a global separability witness must be also a V–separability witness. An important fact to realize is
that the converse is not true, i.e. a V–separability witness does not need to be a global separability witness. Exactly
because of that, restricting the Hahn–Banach theorem does not seem to be a very useful idea. In fact, by doing so
we need to ﬁnd the set of V–separability witnesses, which is in general very diﬀerent from the set of global witnesses
belonging to V. However, a little thought shows that these two sets happen to coincide whenever V ∩ S is at the
same time a section and an orthogonal projection of S (orthogonality at the level of operators is always intended with
respect to the Hilbert–Schmidt product).
Deﬁnition 11. A subspace V ⊆ H(nm; C) of a bipartite system is called a central section (of S) if there exists a
separability–preserving, orthogonal projection of H(nm; C) onto V.

three–dimensional space, then the only central sections would have been planes passing through its center.

The above name captures the intuitive idea of how these subspaces look like. For instance, if S were a sphere in a
G dg ϕ1(g) ⊗

An interesting class of separability–preserving projections includes superoperators of the form PG =(cid:82)
ϕ2(g), where ϕ1 : G → L(cid:0)H(n; C)(cid:1) and ϕ2 : G → L(cid:0)H(m; C)(cid:1) are representations of a compact group G on the spaces

of hermitian matrices, and(cid:82)

G dg is the Haar integral. In this case, V is the set of ﬁxed points of the representation
ϕ1 ⊗ ϕ2, that coincides (up to the Choi isomorphism in an orthogonal basis for a G–invariant product) with the
set of G–commuting isomorphisms H(n; C)ϕ1 → H(m; C)ϕ2, and therefore can be easily determined with the aid
of representation theory. Now, the importance of the concept of central section relies primarily on the following
elementary observation.
Proposition 12. Let V ⊆ H(nm; C) be a central section. Then any V–separability witness is also a global separability
witness.
Proof. Consider a V–separability witness W , and denote by P the separability–preserving projection onto V. Since
any ρ ∈ S satisﬁes P(ρ) ∈ S ∩ V, we have

18

Tr W ρ = TrP(W )ρ = Tr WP(ρ) ≥ 0 .

As an immediate consequence, we obtain an improved version of Theorem 10.

Theorem 13. Let ρ ∈ V ⊆ H(nm; C) be a state belonging to a central section V. Then,

ρ ∈ S ⇐⇒ Tr W ρ ≥ 0 ∀ global separability witnesses W ∈ V.

Proof. The implication ⇒ is obvious, while the converse follows putting together Theorem 10 and Proposition 12.
