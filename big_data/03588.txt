Imaging the magnetic structure of a material is essential to understanding the inﬂuence of the
physical and chemical microstructure on its magnetic properties. Magnetic imaging techniques,
however, have up to now been unable to probe 3D micrometer-sized systems with nanoscale reso-
lution. Here we present the imaging of the magnetic domain conﬁguration of a micrometre-thick
FeGd multilayer with hard X-ray dichroic ptychography at energies spanning both the Gd L3 edge
and the Fe K edge, providing a high spatial resolution spectroscopic analysis of the complex X-
ray magnetic circular dichroism. With a spatial resolution reaching 45 nm, this advance in hard
X-ray magnetic imaging is the ﬁrst step towards the investigation of buried magnetic structures and
extended three-dimensional magnetic systems at the nanoscale.

For optimal integration of new magnetic materials and
systems into technological applications, a detailed un-
derstanding of the magnetic structure and properties
is required.
In particular, for the next generation of
nanocomposite permanent magnets, which have the po-
tential to enable more eﬃcient, smaller and lighter en-
ergy harvesters and motors [1], an understanding of the
inﬂuence of the physical and chemical microstructure on
the magnetic conﬁgurations is of the utmost importance.
X-ray imaging is an excellent candidate for such inves-
tigations [2, 3], oﬀering high spatial resolution, element
speciﬁcity, high sensitivity, and the ability to directly and
non-destructively probe the magnetization of a material.
However, so far, all sub-micrometer spatial resolution
X-ray magnetic imaging has been performed with soft
X-rays, with photon energies below 1.6 keV, due to the
strong magnetic signal available within this regime [4, 5].
Whilst eﬀective for probing the magnetism of thin ﬁlms
and nanostructures [4, 6], soft X-rays are limited to sys-
tems with total material thickness below approximately
200 nm [7, 8]. As a result, until now it has been necessary
to cut magnets into thin slices that are measurable with
soft X-rays [9]. The original magnetic conﬁguration, how-
ever, is likely to be aﬀected by such structural changes,
so preventing a clear understanding of the magnetic mi-
crostructure. Therefore, high spatial resolution magnetic
investigations of thick permanent magnets to be used in
microsystems such as electromagnetic sensors and energy
harvesting devices [10–12], as well as the study of buried
structures integrated into, for example, silicon-based de-
vices [13], have not been possible up to now.

Higher energy X-rays oﬀer a solution to such limita-
tions, with recent advances providing nanometer spatial
resolution imaging of structures with thickness on the
order of many micrometers [14]. For magnetic imaging,
however, hard X-rays have not been considered compet-
itive.
Indeed, soft X-rays, by utilizing the L2,3 edges

(2p-3d ) of transition metals and the M4,5 edges (3d -4f )
of rare earths, directly probe the valence band of the
magnetic material. In the hard X-ray regime, however,
one indirectly probes the magnetization at the K (1s-4p)
edges of transition metals and the L2,3 (2p-5d ) edges of
rare earths, resulting in a signiﬁcantly weaker magnetic
signal [15], and in previous studies of hard X-ray mag-
netic imaging a maximum spatial resolution of 2 µm has
been reached for two dimensional objects [16–19].

In this Letter, we present hard X-ray magnetic imaging
at the nanoscale, demonstrating an improvement in the
achieved spatial resolution of almost a factor of 50. As
a proof-of-principle, we image the magnetic domain con-
ﬁguration of a micrometer-thick FeGd ﬁlm at energies
spanning both the Gd L3 edge, with relatively strong
magnetic contrast, and the Fe K edge. While the mag-
netic signal is substantially weaker at the Fe K edge, we
demonstrate that we can image the magnetic conﬁgura-
tion of the Fe within the system, thus proving the appli-
cability of the technique also to non-rare earth magnetic
elements which are of scientiﬁc interest as an important
alternative to the scarce and expensive rare earth mag-
netic materials [21]. We perform a quantitative spec-
troscopic analysis of the full complex transmission func-
tion for energies spanning the Gd L3 edge, providing a
detailed insight into the relationship between the phase
and absorption XMCD signals and conﬁrming the quan-
titative nature of the technique. Furthermore, we mea-
sure the magnetic conﬁguration of a ﬁlm with a thick-
ness of 500 nm, therefore demonstrating the potential of
the technique to investigate not only free-standing but
also buried thin ﬁlms. The possibility of imaging mag-
netic features in micrometer-thick magnetic ﬁlms with
nanoscale spatial resolution ﬁnally renders hard X-ray
magnetic imaging relevant to magnetism research.

In order to measure the weak magnetic signals in the
hard X-ray regime, a high level of sensitivity is required,

which is provided by ptychography. Ptychography is a
scanning coherent diﬀractive imaging technique which
gives access to the full complex transmission function
of an object [22, 23]. The sample is illuminated with
a coherent beam, and far-ﬁeld diﬀraction patterns are
measured for many overlapping illumination positions.
Both the object and illumination functions are then re-
trieved using an iterative reconstruction algorithm [23–
25]. When combined with three dimensional imaging
techniques such as tomography, this access to the full
complex transmission function enables three dimensional
mapping of the electron [14, 26] and atomic densities [27]
within a sample.

When applied to magnetic imaging, coherent diﬀrac-
tive imaging (CDI) techniques such as ptychography of-
fer high resolution imaging with a number of key advan-
tages [4, 28–32]. For instance, the complex magnetic sig-
nal provided by both CDI and ptychography has enabled
the imaging of ferromagnetic domains with linearly po-
larized light through isolation of the magnetic diﬀraction
by a simple subtraction of the pure electronic scattering
measured when the magnetic state is removed with a sat-
urating magnetic ﬁeld [28, 30]. An investigation of the
complex magnetic signal with soft X-ray holography also
found that imaging with the phase signal before the ab-
sorption edge can minimise the radiation dose required
[29].

In this work we perform dichroic hard X-ray pty-
chography, exploiting X-ray magnetic circular dichroism
(XMCD), a resonant eﬀect where the electronic transi-
tion probed by circularly polarized X-rays is dependent
on the component of the magnetization of the sample
along the X-ray propagation direction as well as the sign
of the X-ray polarization [3]. The high spatial resolution,
sensitivity, and quantitative nature of ptychography al-
low us to perform a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the
complex X-ray magnetic circular dichroic signal whilst
achieving the ﬁrst demonstration of nanoscale hard X-
ray magnetic imaging.

Experimentally, we perform ptychography scans with
circularly left (CL) and right (CR) polarized light in or-
der to non-destructively image magnetic features in our
sample with both phase and absorption magnetic con-
trast, without the need to apply a saturating ﬁeld. Ex-
plicitly, the complex transmission function is given by
T (E) = a(E)eiφ(E), where a is the amplitude and φ the
phase, which both depend strongly on the X-ray energy
E in the vicinity of an absorption edge. We deﬁne the
dichroic signal as:

AXMCD(%) = (|aL|2 − |aR|2)/∆edge × 100 % (1)

φXMCD = φL − φR,

(2)

where AXMCD and φXMCD are the absorption and phase

piezoelectric stage is used to scan the sample across the beam.

XMCD contrast. Scale bars represent 1 µm.

XMCD signals, respectively, and ∆edge is the relative
change in absorption across the absorption edge. aL,R
and φL,R are the amplitude and phase of the complex
transmission function, respectively, measured with left
(L) and right (R) circularly polarized incident light.

The dichroic ptychography setup [33]

is shown in
Fig. 1(a). Circularly polarized light, necessary to exploit
XMCD, was converted from linearly polarized light us-
ing a 500 µm-thick diamond quarter-wave phase retarder
[35] and the degree of polarization of the X-rays was de-
termined using a polarization analyzer setup [36]. The
X-rays were found to be over 99% circularly polarized,
with the phase plate absorbing approximately 65% of the
incident light.
Ptychography scans performed with a ﬁeld of view of
5 × 5 µm2 consisted of a diﬀraction pattern being mea-
sured at each of 278 scanning points placed on a fermat
spiral grid [37]. At each point, the diﬀraction pattern
was measured with a 0.2 second exposure time using
a single photon counting Pilatus 2M detector [38, 39]
7.219(1) m downstream of the sample. Each scan took
approximately 112 seconds, including the time taken for
positioning the sample at each point with a piezo-electric
motor. To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, ten such
scans were repeated for each energy, measured with left
and right circularly polarized light.

the diﬀerence taken between images measured with CR and CL circular light. Phase (upper row) and absorption (lower row)

phase and absorption signals. The XMCD data measured with ptychography are compared with a reference AXMCD spectrum
(red line), measured in ﬂuorescence on a similar sample, and the corresponding φXMCD reference spectrum calculated with the
Kramers-Kronig relations (dashed blue line), along with a transmission spectrum (black line).

Ptychographic reconstructions were performed using a
gradient-based maximum likelihood estimation [40, 41],
with a maximum possible number of iterations of 500,
although convergence was typically reached before 300
iterations. Further details on the the experimental setup
and reconstruction are given in the supplementary infor-
mation [33].

contrast of the platinum alignment structures, magnetic
stripe domains are visible and the magnetic contrast re-
verses when the polarization is changed from CL to CR.
The diﬀerence of the two images removes the electron
density contrast and leaves an XMCD image with purely
magnetic contrast, as shown in the rightmost image of
Fig. 1(b).

In order to demonstrate dichroic ptychography, the
magnetic conﬁgurations of 1 µm and 500 nm thick
Fe(0.41nm)/Gd(0.45nm) multilayer ﬁlms with perpen-
dicular magnetic anisotropy [33] were imaged. The multi-
layer ﬁlms were deposited with RF magnetron sputtering
on a Si3N4 membrane with a growth rate of 0.15 nm/s at
room temperature. To enable image alignment, platinum
nanostructures were deposited on the ﬁlm with focused
electron beam deposition.

An example of the absorption part of the ptychogra-
phy reconstructions taken with CL and CR polarized light
at the Gd L3 edge, with photon energy of 7.445 keV,
is shown in Fig. 1(b). Along with the electron density

The spatial resolution of a single absorption image was
determined via Fourier ring correlation [42] to be approx-
imately 60 nm. Averaging of ﬁve images resulted in a spa-
tial resolution of 45 nm, representing a ﬁfty-fold increase
in the achieved spatial resolution with dichroic ptychog-
raphy compared with previous measurements with hard
X-rays. The spatial resolution of the phase images, how-
ever, was estimated to be 70 − 80 nm. Thus, whilst the
phase information typically oﬀers better electron density
contrast, in our experiment absorption contrast provided
better magnetic contrast and spatial resolution. The edge
sharpness of the domain walls was found to be approxi-
mately 60 nm by taking a line proﬁle perpendicular to the

domain walls. Taking into account the spatial resolution,
the domain wall width is calculated to be 40 nm.

To investigate the energy dependence of the complex
XMCD signal and the quantitative nature of the tech-
nique, dichroic ptychography was performed for diﬀerent
photon energies spanning the Gd L3 edge, that ranged
from 7.234 keV to 7.256 keV in steps of 1.5 eV. The phase
and absorption components of the sample transmission
are shown in Fig. 2(a). Below the edge, the magnetic
phase contrast is inverted with respect to the absorption
contrast, and can be seen to reverse when traversing the
absorption edge. Measurements of the phase and absorp-
tion XMCD signal were extracted from the images by
ﬁtting a Gaussian distribution to the histogram of the
XMCD contrast of the pixels within the domains. They
are given as a function of energy across the absorption
edge in Fig. 2(b), represented by blue squares (φXMCD)
and red circles (AXMCD), where the maximum absorp-
tion contrast is found to be 8.2 % of ∆edge at 7.2445 keV,
1 eV below the absorption edge.

In order to check whether the ptychography measure-
ments provide a quantitative measurement of the com-
plex XMCD signal, the ptychography AXMCD spectrum
was compared with a reference AXMCD spectrum mea-
sured in ﬂuorescence yield with a standard XMCD setup
on an equivalent sample (see supp. mat.
[33, 34]),
also plotted in Fig. 2(b) (red line). From the excel-
lent agreement between the magnitude and form of the
AXMCD signals measured with ptychography and the ﬂu-
orescence technique, it is evident that dichroic ptychog-
raphy not only allows high quality imaging of the do-
main structure with unprecedented spatial resolution and
sensitivity, but moreover provides quantiﬁcation of the
magnetic contrast. This allows for the relative magni-
tude of vector components of the magnetisation to be
directly compared, which is critical for 3D magnetic in-
vestigations. The direct measurement of the φXMCD sig-
nal (blue squares) is further compared with a reference
φXMCD spectrum calculated from reference absorption
spectra using the Kramers-Kronig relations [15] (dashed
blue line) in Fig. 2(b). While the calculated spectrum
is symmetric about the inversion point, the measured
φXMCD data is shifted by 0.5 eV, with the magnitude of
its signal being asymmetric about the inversion point.
Although not critical to the current work, these diﬀer-
ences are likely to be associated with a physical eﬀect
that warrants investigation in the future.

The element speciﬁcity of X-rays enables the direct
comparison of the magnetization of diﬀerent elements
within a sample. In the FeGd multilayer, the magnetic
states of the Fe and Gd are strongly antiferromagnetically
coupled, resulting in the same magnetic domain structure
expected for both materials. An absorption image con-
sisting of 60 averaged single scans and measured with CL
polarization at the Fe K edge with a photon energy of
7.113 keV is shown in the inset of Fig. 3. Indeed, when

FIG. 3. The quantitative AXMCD signal measured with
dichroic ptychography across the Fe K edge (red circles) is
plotted along with a reference XMCD spectrum (red line)
measured in ﬂuorescence on a similar ﬁlm. A single polariza-
tion image with 90 nm spatial resolution is given in the inset,
where the stripe domain pattern can be seen, along with the
electron density contrast of the Pt markers. The domains are
indicated by white and black arrows to the left of the image.

comparing the domain structure measured at the Fe K
edge with that measured with CL at the Gd L3 edge in
Fig. 1, the same domain structure is observed, reversed
in sign due to the antiferromagnetic coupling (see supp.
mat.
[33]). As the magnetic signal at the Fe K edge is
an order of magnitude weaker than that found at the Gd
L3 edge [2], by imaging the magnetic domains at energies
across the Fe K edge the sensitivity of dichroic ptychog-
raphy is also demonstrated. The AXMCD data extracted
from the images are presented in Fig. 3 (red squares),
and agree well with the AXMCD signal of a similar sam-
ple measured by ﬂuorescence (red line). This ability to
investigate materials beyond rare-earths opens up the use
of our technique to the study and optimization of a wide
variety of magnetic samples.

Finally, in order to investigate the suitability of hard
X-ray ptychography for the imaging of thinner layers, the
domain structure of a 500 nm-thick FeGd ﬁlm was imaged
at the Gd L3 edge. The spatial resolution of an absorp-
tion image was measured to be approximately 90 nm for
the absorption image, and the AXMCD and φXMCD were
measured to be (0.015 ± 0.002) and (0.9 ± 0.2) mrad, re-
spectively. The magnetic domains were found to have
average widths of (390 ± 7) nm and (554 ± 11) nm for
the 500 nm and 1 µm thick ﬁlms, respectively. This is in
good agreement with Kittel’s prediction that the domain
width of a thick ﬁlm with uniaxial anisotropy will scale
proportional to the square root of the thickness of the
ﬁlm [43].

In summary, we have achieved a ﬁfty-fold increase in

spatial resolution in hard X-ray magnetic imaging by
means of ptychography. This is a signiﬁcant advance in
the capabilities of X-ray magnetic imaging and will of-
fer access to the magnetic conﬁgurations of a wide range
of samples that up to now would have been impossible
to measure. Further combination with 3D imaging tech-
niques such as tomography [14] will open up the possi-
bility of mapping the magnetization vector ﬁeld within
micrometer-size magnetic systems. Moreover, with fu-
ture brighter diﬀraction limited X-ray sources oﬀering an
expected increase in coherent ﬂux of 2-3 orders of mag-
nitude [44, 45], hard X-ray dichroic ptychography has
the potential to provide single digit nanometer resolu-
tion and be extended towards thin ﬁlm heterostructures
or architectures.
