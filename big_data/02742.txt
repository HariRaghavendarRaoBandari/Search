The kinetics of the growing process of porous silicon (PS) during the etching process was studied using the
photoacoustic technique. To analyses the experimental changes that suﬀer the PA amplitude, an extension
of the theory developed by Rosencwaig and Gersho for the photoacoustic eﬀect in solids is proposed. The
solution of the heat equation takes into account the pumping modulate beam, the changes in the reﬂectance of
the PS-backing heterostructure, and the electrochemical reaction as thermal sources. The model includes the
time-dependence of sample thickness lb(t) during the electrochemical etching of porous silicon. The changes
in the reﬂectance were identiﬁed as the laser reﬂections in the internal layers of the system, which is modelled
by a sinusoidal monochromatic light term, whose frequency is related to the etch velocity of PS. The chemical
reaction and the DC components of the heat sources are taken as an average value from the experimental
data. The theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental data and provided a method to
determine variables of the PS growing such as the etching velocity during the process.

Nowadays, the increases of electronic devices demand
based on porous silicon (PS) for biological, medical, and
sensor applications is an important topic. It means that
is necessary to develop techniques that permit the in situ
study of the PS formation. The electrochemical etching
is a common method to obtain PS ﬁlms.2 The physical
properties of PS depend on several parameters such as
anodization current, resistivity, crystalline orientation,
electrolyte composition, and the temperature.3 The
biggest problem for the fabrication of devices based on
PS is its reproducibility, and usually, the characterization
of its properties is made ex situ. There are a few works
about the in situ techniques to study the PS formation.
One of them was reported by Foss et al.,4 they used
a method based on optical
interferometry which can
determine the porosity, thickness, and roughness of PS
ﬁlm. However, the information regarding the growing
process is neglected. As alternative, Ramirez-Gutierrez
et al.,5 reported a methodology based on the photoa-
coustic technique for monitoring in situ the PS etching.
Photoacoustic is a technique that has been used to study
kinetic processes, thermal, and electronic properties of
semiconductor materials,8–10 therefore, this modulate
technique will be able to detect in situ the chemical
reaction and changes in the optical properties during PS
formation.

In the previous works, the photoacoustic signal during

the electrochemical etching of PS formation had been not
modelled, because the thermal sources that inﬂuence the
changes in the photoacoustic (PA) signal are unknown.
The primary mechanism to generate the PA signal is
the heat transfer between the diﬀerent regions of the
cell. Therefore, if there exists control over each one of
the parameters that aﬀect the PS growing (solvent/acid
ratio, temperature, current, among others), as well
as a complete knowledge of the Si substrate6 (carrier
distribution), it is possible to model the PA signal by
solving the heat equation. The thermal sources for the
PA signal in the case of PS formation are: the well know
incident modulated laser; and due to that the PS for-
mation is a kinetic process in which the thickness of the
sample changes as a function of the time; the variations
in the reﬂectance of the incident modulated beam is the
second source.5 It is clear that the chemical reaction
that allows the PS formation is also a thermal source.
However, during the growing it is not possible to know
the heat originated from the electrochemical reaction
that depends on the carrier uniformity of the sample.
All of these sources have to be taken into account for a
theoretical description of the PA phenomena.

In this work, it is used a phenomenological extension
of the Rosencwaig and Gersho model,11 to reproduce
the PA amplitude signal for the PS formation. The
heat sources are writing in explicit form, and these are
speciﬁed by the incidence, reﬂection, and absorption of
light by the layers formed during the etching process.

velocity of PS formation.

Consider a cylindrical photoacoustic cell which its
cross-sectional geometry is shown in Fig. 1. The sam-
ple and backing are also cylindrical. Assuming that l, lb
and lg are the thickness of the sample (s), backing mate-
rial (b) and gas column (g), respectively; and αi, ki, and
βi represent the thermal diﬀusivity, thermal conductiv-
ity, and optical absorption coeﬃcient for each material.
The heat transfer is considered one-dimensional in the x
direction.

FIG. 1. Cross-sectional of the photoacoustic cell. The labels
s, b and g corresponds to sample, backing, and gas, respec-
tively.

The electrochemical reaction makes that the sample-
backing boundary lb moves in time. Let us consider that
v is the velocity of the PS formation which can be taken
as constant5. Thus, the moving boundary can be written
as

lb(t) = lb − vt.

(1)

This assumption gives two scenarios: the ﬁrst one is
when the reaction has not consumed the backing, and
the second one when there is only PS. These situations
imply that there is an interval of time τ in which there
are three regions (sample, backing, and gas) and for times
t > τ there are only two regions (sample and gas). The
value of τ is given by

τ = lb/v.

(2)

By experimental conditions, the thermal sources of the
PA signal arise from the periodic excitation of the solid
sample, which is directly excited by the modulated light,
and from the electrochemical silicon etch in the sample-
backing interface. The solid sample heats the backing
material which in turn modify the temperature distribu-
tion of surrounding gas where the microphone is ﬁxed for
the signal detection. Thus the heat equation for the solid
sample is

∇2Ts(x, t) − 1
αs

∂Ts(x, t)

∂t

= fs(x, t) + Q(t)

(3)

To determine fs(x, t),

it is assumed a modulated
monochromatic light source impinging the surface at
a frequency ω1 with an intensity I0, which is in part
reﬂected (Ir) and transmitted (I1t). At the interface
sample-backing, the transmitted light is reﬂected (I1r)
to sample and transmitted (I2t) to the backing. On the
other hand, the thickness of backing is changing in time
by the electrochemical etch, the reﬂected light appears
with diﬀerent phase respect to the incident light, in or-
der to satisfy the boundary conditions of the electromag-
netic ﬁeld. From the experimental experience, this ef-
fect can be represented by an additional monochromatic
light source with frequency ω2 in backing-sample direc-
tion. The superposition of these two eﬀects allows to
write fs(x, t) in the region −(l + lb) < x < −lb + vt as

fs(x, t) = − A(1 + eiω1t)e−βs(x+lb+l)
− B(1 + eiω2t)eβs(x+lb+vt),

represent the heat density at x = −(l + lb) and x = −lb,
respectively, with ηi the eﬃciency at which the absorbed

processes.11
The same procedure is applied to write the heat equa-
tion for the backing material in the region −lb +vt < x <

The intensities from Eqs. (5) and (8) satisfy the system

of equations given by

I1t + Ir0 = I0
I2t + I1r = I1t
I2t + I2r = 1,

(9)

where I0 and Ir0 can be extracted from the experiment.

Finally, the heat equation for the gas is given by

∇2Tg(x, t) − 1

∂Tg(x, t)

= 0

(10)

where fs(x, t) and Q(t) are the heat sources product of
the modulated laser and electrochemical reaction, respec-
tively. The electrochemical reaction occurs only at the
PS/Si interface.

In order to solve the Eqs. (3), (6), and (10) we use
the superposition principle for each source of heat by an
extension of the model presented in Ronsencwaig and
Gersho.11 The temperature ﬁeld in the cell is given by

3

which we apply separately to each source and to its AC
and DC components. Our attention is focused on θn,
the complex amplitude of the periodic temperature at
x = 0, which give us the source of photoacoustic signal.
By using the Eqs. (19), these amplitudes are

The periodic excitation of the backing-gas boundary
makes that the gas column expands and contracts at
the same frequency of the oscillations of the temperature
ﬁeld. This eﬀect can be interpreted as an acoustic piston
which produces an acoustic pressure signal which is re-
ceived by the microphone. In our analysis, the PA ampli-
tude signal is time dependent. Therefore, it is convenient
to deﬁne the average temperature of the gas. From the
functional form of the temperature ﬁeld, there exists a
characteristic length λg in which the periodic tempera-
ture variation in the gas is eﬀectively fully damped out.
Thus, let us deﬁne the average temperature in the gas as

As can be seen, the modiﬁed RG model for the PA
signal takes into account the above-mentioned thermal
sources. By using experimental values of the PA cell
size, modulated frequency, thermal properties of the
sample, gas (thermal diﬀusivity and conductivity), and
sample size (see Table I). It is possible to calculate
the AC component of the PA Amplitude signal
for
the PS growing. The velocity of the chemical reac-
tion is another parameter that is involved in the PA
amplitude signal. Figure 2 shows the AC component

of PA Amplitude signal calculated from Eq. (29) as
a function of the etching time, this simulation uses
the parameters showed in Table I. This ﬁgure exhibits
harmonic behaviours. The frequency of this signal is
constant in time.
It means that one of the real parts
of the amplitudes in Eq. (20) predominates in the
heat transfer. Also, it is evident that the amplitude of
this signal is modulated. This modulation is related
to the increase in the optical path of the transmitted
light mainly in the PS layer. The baseline in Fig. 2 is
centered in zero given that the modulated source does
not produce an average heating of the sample since
there are continuous excitation/deexcitation processes.
For a complete description of the heating process, it is
necessary to know the contribution to the heat transfer
of the chemical etching and the thermal inertia or DC
component. This information is taken from the experi-
mental PA Amplitude signal which is shown in Fig. 3.
This ﬁgure shows a characteristic PA Amplitude signal
for the PS formation using a P-type Si wafer, 0.0005
Ωcm−1 (WRS Materials, USA) as a substrate, in which
the follows parameter were used: 500 µm thickness,
[100] orientation. The etching conditions were 7:3 V/V
ethanol/HF ratio, and 20 mA anodization current. The
amplitude signal was divided into four regions. Region

in the chamber. In this region, the power supply is still
oﬀ. It is expects a moment while the native surface of
silicon oxide reacts with the HF and it is removed. In
the region (c) the power supply is turned on and the PS
formation takes place. This region is characterized by
the oscillatory shape of the PA signal. Finally, for the (d)
region the power supply is still turned on, but the coher-
ent interference eﬀect12 is lost due to the thick ﬁlm of PS.

By direct comparison between Fig. 3 and Fig. 2 it can
be seen that the predominant amplitude in this signal
comes from θ2 (Eq. 20) given that the AC-PA cycles cor-
respond to the frequency ω2 in concordance with the ex-
perimental data, in which a complete cycle takes around
tetching ∼ 40 s.

Here it is necessary to take into account that the etch-
ing process also contributes with the PA signal as well as
the DC component of the process (thermal inertia) that

can be obtained using diﬀerent criteria: the minimum,
the maximum or the average of the PA amplitude sig-
nal of the characteristic growing process as a function of
the etching time.
In this case the average criteria was
used. Here is important to note that this average tem-
perature actually are the contributions of the DC and
etching heating. Figure 4, shows the average tempera-
ture for the etching process, in which is noticeable that
the temperature of the PA chamber increases.

According to the above description of the thermal
sources for the etching process of PS, the changes in the
pressure can be written as follows:

∆P (t) = ∆PAC(t) + ∆PDC(t) + Etching.

(30)

Figures 5 and 6 show a comparison between the exper-
imental data (blue line) for 64 PA cycles and the theo-
retical results for amplitude obtained using Eq. 30 (red
line), as well as the DC contribution coming from chem-
ical reaction (green line). From a physical point of view,
the model reproduces the phenomenology of experimen-
tal PA signal. The model predicts that the changes in
the reﬂectance have a characteristic frequency (ω2) that
governs the PA amplitude signal. An envelope function
includes the thermal inertia and the variations in the
substrate thickness. In this case, the frequency (ω2, see
Table I) for the simulation was taken from the experi-
mental data, to appreciate the accuracy of the model.
The theoretical results exhibit great concordance with
the experiment data. The reproduction of these cycles
using our model, are the most relevant information, be-
cause there is a direct relationship between the cycles and
the velocity of PS formation.

The velocity of the PS for growing with four PA cycles
was determiend earlier5. These results indicate that the
velocity of the etching is cosntant. From the analysis of
Figs. 5 and 6, the shift in some intervals of etching time
evidences changes in the velocity of PS formation. This

the impurities and variations in the crystalline quality of
the Si wafer.6

According to our considerations that took into account
three thermal sources (laser, reﬂectance changes, and
electrochemical reaction), the modiﬁed RG model repro-
duces in detail the growing conditions of PS. Results in-
dicate that the frequency of the reﬂectance changes gov-
erns the PA signal, therefore, using this model is possible
to determine the velocity of the etching process. Finally,
from Fig. 4 the electrochemical reaction is continuous and
the increment of the PA amplitude can be considered as
exothermic reaction.
