ABSTRACT

Context. Physisorbed atoms on the surface of interstellar dust grains play a central role in solid state astrochemistry. Their surface
reactivity is one source of the observed molecular complexity in space. In experimental astrophysics, the high reactivity of atoms also
constitutes an obstacle to measuring two of the fundamental properties in surface physics, namely desorption and diﬀusion energies,
and so far direct measurements are non-existent for O and N atoms.
Aims. We investigated the diﬀusion and desorption processes of O and N atoms on cold surfaces in order to give boundary conditions
to astrochemical models.
Methods. Here we propose a new technique for directly measuring the N- and O-atom mass signals. Including the experimental results
in a simple model allows us to almost directly derive the desorption and diﬀusion barriers of N atoms on amorphous solid water ice
(ASW) and O atoms on ASW and oxidized graphite.
Results. We ﬁnd a strong constraint on the values of desorption and thermal diﬀusion energy barriers. The measured barriers for O
atoms are consistent with recent independent estimations and prove to be much higher than previously believed (Edes = 1410+290−160;
Edi f = 990+530−360 K on ASW). As for oxygen atoms, we propose that the combination Edes-Edi f =1320-750 K is a sensible choice
among the possible pairs of solutions. Also, we managed to measure the desorption and diﬀusion energy of N atoms for the ﬁrst time
(Edes = 720+160−80 ; Edi f = 525+260−200 K on ASW) in the thermal hopping regime and propose that the combination Edes-Edi f =720-400 K
can be reasonably adopted in models. The value of Edi f for N atoms is slightly lower than previously suggested, which implies that
the N chemistry on dust grains might be richer.

Key words. Molecular clouds – Interstellar ices – Desorption energy – Diﬀusion energy – Oxygen atoms – Nitrogen atoms

1. Introduction
Molecules are often used as tracers of the physical conditions of many astrophysical environments. Their presence and abundance,
as well as their internal states, give strong constraints on the temperature, density, and also dynamics of the observed media.
Observations are almost always supported by models, and as soon as the abundance of a new molecular species can be measured,
new or improved chemical pathways are implemented in these models. Gas phase chemistry can explain the majority of the observed
molecular abundances, but there are cases where interstellar dust grains are indespensable to astrochemistry. This is the case for H2
formation (Gould&Salpeter 1963; Hollenbach&Salpeter 1970), and for a long time, solid state chemistry has been thought to be the
solution to the open questions gas phase chemistry could not address. For example, it has been proposed that hydrogenation, leading
to saturation of species (i.e., C → CH4, O → H2O, CO → CH3OH), occurs on dust grains and subsequently is at the origin of part
of the molecular complexity observed in space (Charnley et al. 2000).
Most astrochemical models that include solid-state chemistry (Hasegawa & Herbst 1992; Charnley et al. 2000; Caselli et al.
2002; Cuppen & Herbst 2007; Cazaux et al. 2010; Vasyunin et al. 2013; Reboussin et al. 2014 and references therein) refer to
the article by Tielens & Hagen (1982), a watershed paper that proposed diﬀusion controlled reactions and accretion/desorption
processes as the corner-stone of solid state chemistry.

Atoms and molecules can adsorb on a surface through two kinds of bonding (chemisorption or physisorption) depending on the
physical-chemical properties of the surface (temperature and chemical structure) and of the adparticle, i.e., its energy and electronic
structure (Oura et al. 2003). At low surface temperatures where icy mantles can grow, physisorption processes involving Van der
Waals interactions (10-400 meV) (Buckingham et al. 1988) are dominant. Physisorption concerns low surface temperatures (<
100 K) and low particle energies (< 50 meV), which are physical conditions that make physisorption hard to study experimentally
and theoretically. Nevertheless in the last decade, an ever-growing number of works have dealt with a systematic study of the physics
and chemistry of physisorbed species on cold non-metallic surfaces, namely graphite, silicates, and water ices (Pirronello et al. 1997;
Ioppolo et al. 2008; Fillion et al. 2009; Goumans et al. 2010; Watanabe et al. 2010; Ward et al. 2011; Karssemeijer et al. 2012, 2014;
Congiu et al. 2012; Thrower et al. 2014, and references therein). Both astrochemical models and experimental studies reveal that
solid state chemistry is governed by a desorption-diﬀusion competition. In Fig. 1 we show a sketch representing the desorption and
diﬀusion processes and a diagram of the desorption energy Edes and the diﬀusion energy Edi f potentials.

If the desorption mechanism dominates, physisorbed reactive partners cannot increase the molecular complexity. Conversely, if
diﬀusion mechanisms are preponderant, mobile atoms will be able to scan the surface and aﬀect the abundance and variety of the
species eventually created. Diﬀusion and desorption barriers can be studied independently in the case of stable species (Mispelaer
et al. 2013; Collings et al. 2004; Bisschop et al. 2006; Noble et al. 2012), but that is not the case for reactive species (i.e., atoms
or radicals). In fact, the intrinsic mobility and reactivity of atoms governs the chemistry, but at the same time it hinders any direct
measurement of the adsorption energy of atoms.

Experimental studies of reactive species were initially focused on the diﬀusion-desorption of H atoms (Manic`o et al. 2001;
Hornaeker et al. 2003; Amiaud et al. 2007). These works led to diﬀerent results. The ambiguity probably originated in the use of an
experimental technique (temperature-programmed desorption, TPD) that aﬀects the mobility of atoms. For this reason, Matar et al.
(2008) subsequently used the ability of H atoms to diﬀuse and react with a probe molecule (O2) to study H mobility and obtain an
eﬀective diﬀusion barrier. In more sophisticated experiments, Hama et al. (2012) forced the desorption of H atoms by laser pulses
and measured their residence time on diﬀerent substrates to derive H mobility.
More recently, the diﬀusion of O atoms was investigated on diﬀerent substrates experimentally and theoretically at low (∼ 6 K)
(Minissale et al. 2013; Minissale et al. 2014a; Congiu et al. 2014; Lee&Meuwly 2014) and high surface temperatures (50 K)
(Minissale et al. 2015a). Simultaneously, two experimental groups (Ward et al. 2011; Kimber et al. 2014; He et al. 2015) proposed
a rather high value for the adsorption energy of O atoms (i.e., 1500–1800 K) on diﬀerent substrates, consistently with theoretical
estimations by Bergeron et al. (2008). On the other hand, no experimental data have existed so far that cover N-atom desorption and
diﬀusion barriers.

The aim of this article is twofold. First, we propose an original method of directly measuring the adsorption energy of reactive
species; second, we provide an experimental value of the adsorption energies of O and N atoms on two surface analogues of
astrophysical interest, i.e., compact amorphous solid water (ASW) ice and oxidized graphite. The ASW template mimics ice-coated
grains in clouds with Av¿3, whereas oxidized graphite simulates grain surface conditions in thin clouds (Av¡3).

2. Experimental
Experiments were performed using the FORMOLISM set-up (Congiu et al. 2012), an ultra-high vacuum chamber (passivated for
O atoms) coupled to a triply diﬀerentially pumped atomic beam aimed at a temperature controlled sample holder. The substrate is
an ZYA-grade HOPG (highly oriented pyrolytic graphite) slab previously exposed to an O-atom beam (oxidized) to avoid surface
changes during the experimental sequences. Water ice ﬁlms were grown on top of the HOPG substrate by spraying water vapour
from a microchannel array doser located 2 cm in front of the surface. The water vapour was obtained from deionized water that
had been puriﬁed by several freeze-pump-thaw cycles, carried out under vacuum. Amorphous solid water ice was dosed while the
surface was held at a constant temperature of 110 K.

O(N) atoms were produced by dissociating O2(N2) gas in a quartz tube placed within a Surfatron cavity. The cavity can deliver
a maximum microwave power of 200 W at 2.45 GHz. We calibrated the atomic/molecular ﬂuxes as described in Amiaud et al.
=(3.0±0.3)×1012 molecules
(2007) and Noble et al. (2012). We found φO=5±0.4×1012 atoms cm−2s−1, φN =2±0.4×1012, and φO2,N2
cm−2s−1. The dissociated fraction µ is typically 75% for O2 and 30% for N2. We can study the electronic state composition of the
beam particles by tuning the energy of the ionizing electrons of the QMS. This technique allows ground-state or excited atoms and
molecules to be selectively detected, as described in Congiu et al. (2009). We determined that our oxygen beam did not contain
O(1D) nor O2(a1∆−
g ) (Minissale et al. 2014a). The nitrogen beam did not contain
N atoms in an excited state, while a fraction of N2 molecules were found to be in ro-vibrationally excited states (Minissale et al.
2014c). However, this is not an issue because atoms will relax rapidly on the surface. The beam temperature is typically lower than
400 K both for O and N atoms.

g ) and was composed of only O(3P) and O2(X3Σ−

2.1. The TP-DED technique
Experiments consisted in exposing the sample to the atomic beam while slowly reducing (17 mK/s) the sample temperature from
110 K to 10 K. The quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) was placed close to the surface and the species desorbing from the surface
were measured continuously, as shown in Fig. 2. Incoming atoms from the beam cannot enter the QMS head directly owing to the
geometric conﬁguration of our apparatus. Atoms can be scattered by the surface, desorb after thermalization, or react on the surface.
The desorption ﬂux is proportional to the mass signal measured in the experiments. The new method we probed in this work is
a combination of the King and Wells method, TPD technique, and during-exposure-desorption (DED) technique used to measure
chemical desorption eﬃciency (Dulieu et al. 2013; Minissale et al. 2014b). The resulting combined technique is a temperature-
programmed during-exposure desorption (TP-DED). The linearly decreasing temperature is an aspect of major importance. In fact,
this allows us to have the surface free of adsorbates at least in the high-temperature part of the experiment. Unlike the coverage at
high temperatures, the surface density is more questionable in the low-temperature regime.

2.2. Experimental results
An example of TP-DED is shown in Fig. 3. Here we show the normalized QMS ion count of mass 32 and mass 16 concurrent with
an exposure of O atoms to compact ASW. Mass 32 and mass 16 correspond to O2 and O detection, respectively. Because of cracking

TP-DEDs were performed with a ramp of -17 mK/s

of molecules in the QMS head, the contribution of O2 to mass 16 is weak and falls within the error bars. Signals are normalized with
respect to the high-temperature-regime ion count. At high temperatures (above 68 K) we observe a plateau, which means that the
number of atoms and molecules coming oﬀ the surface is constant. The plateau behaviour indicates that the desorption ﬂux evens
up with the incoming ﬂux of particles. In other words, the residence time of O atoms on the surface is very short if compared with
the mean time between the arrival of two atoms at the same adsorption site (about 300±25s, Minissale et al. 2014a).

As long as the desorption rate is greater than the incoming ﬂux, the accumulation of O atoms cannot occur. The desorption
energy of O2 molecules is considerably lower (Noble et al. 2012) than that of O atoms, therefore O2 does not represent a high-
coverage species at high temperatures. During the TP-DED, the desorption rate follows an exponential decrease with temperature.
As soon as the accretion rate exceeds the desorption rate, the O-atom surface density increases. That compensates in part for the
decrease in the desorption rate, but then diﬀusion-reaction events begin to dominate. This is why we observe the drop in atom count.
The O atoms no longer leave the surface, but instead diﬀuse and react. This is corroborated by the spectra of mass 32, showing
an increase in the O2 signal between 68 and 54 K. The residence time of O2 at 68 K on compact ice is about 25 ms (Noble et al.
2012). Therefore, at our experimental timescales ((cid:29) 1 s), O2 desorbs almost immediately after it forms. Below 54 K, the signal at
mass 32 begins to go down. The decrease in O2 signal may be due to desorption, but is more likely related to its transformation into
O3, which is an eﬃcient process as long as the O2 residence time is long enough to allow for O+O2 encounters (Minissale et al.
2014a). Actually, O and O2 may be simultaneously on the surface for an interval of about 1 K, corresponding to a length of time of
one minute under our experimental conditions. That would lead to the formation of at most 0.12 layers (upper limit) of ozone if we
assume that the O+O2 eﬃciency is one.

At temperatures lower than 40 K, there is a second plateau for mass 16 that remains unchanged until the end of the cooling
ramp occurring at 10 K. The intensity of this low-temperature plateau lies between 10 and 15% of the normalized signal. A simple
interpretation of this residual O-atom signal is that it is due to the fraction of atoms bouncing oﬀ the surface without staying on it.
This would indicate that the sticking coeﬃcient of O atoms is higher than 85%. This is consistent with what is expected. On one
hand, sticking eﬃciencies of light species (H2, HD, D2) have shown to have a clear dependence on their mass (Matar et al. 2010;
Chaabouni et al. 2012); on the other hand, heavier molecules like water or O2 have a sticking eﬃciency higher than 90% (Bisschop
et al. 2006). It must be noted that our spectrometer is located close to the specular reﬂection angle opposite the beam-line, thus
the scattered part of the beam is probably overestimated, as we have seen in the case of O2 molecules. Nonetheless, assuming a
conservative lower limit of 85% for the sticking eﬃciency of O atoms seems reasonable.

In the case of nitrogen, the presence of N2 in the lower plateau region is probably of more importance because the desorption
energy values of N2 and N are rather close. The total exposure time between the two plateaus, which is where most of the information
is found (e.g., atoms and molecules present on the surface at once), corresponds to an integrated exposure of around two layers.
Nevertheless, since the most molecules are desorbing at the beginning of the signal drop, we can fairly assume that no more than a
complete layer was formed on the surface. This explains our choice of an unusual temperature ramp: slow enough to be certain that
a quasi steady state was achieved at any time, but fast enough to be certain that no multilayer eﬀects could occur.

Fig. 4 displays the experimental and modeled TP-DED spectra obtained during irradiation with O atoms of oxidized graphite
(panel α) and irradiation with O atoms and N atoms of ASW (panel β and panel γ, respectively). In each case, the trend of the
experimental data follow the same scheme:
– a high-temperature plateau, i.e., desorption ﬂux = incoming beam of particles;
– an intermediate region, where diﬀusion-reaction events consume atoms and the desorption ﬂux is reduced with decreasing

– a low-temperature plateau, where atoms no longer desorb from the surface (except for a small fraction bouncing oﬀ the surface

temperature;

without accommodating on it).

The diﬀerences in the three cases can be interpreted according to the position of high- and low-temperature plateaus.
Experimental values of O atoms sent onto ASW show that the spectral features are shifted towards lower temperatures with re-

3. Discussion
It is possible to build a very simple model to reproduce the experimental curves. This was done by computing the evolution of the
atom population on the surface. The loss rate of species X from the surface is
dX
dt
where φX is the ﬂux of incoming atoms, X is the surface density of atom X, and kX−des is the desorption rate
kX−des = ν0e−EX−des/kbTs
(2)
where ν0 is the vibration frequency typically assumed to be 1012 s−1, Ts is the surface temperature, and EX−des represents the
desorption energy. The resulting desorption ﬂux X · kX−des is proportional to the mass signal measured in the experiments. Finally,
R(X,kX−di f ) represents a series of terms accounting for reactions involving particle X (Minissale et al. 2014a, 2015a), where X can
be O, O2, or O3, and kX−di f and EX−di f are the diﬀusion rate and diﬀusion energy of species X, respectively. Since diﬀusion should
be dominated by thermal hopping in the range of high temperatures (30–70 K), we use an Arrhenius-type law (eq. 2) to simulate
diﬀusion by using EX−di f instead of EX−des. EX−des and EX−di f represent the two numerical parameters of our model; the symbol X
will be omitted when we do not refer to a speciﬁc species or whenever that is clearly speciﬁed in the text. As for O2, O3, and N2,
the diﬀusion and desorption energies were ﬁxed. Their values are shown in Table 1.

The curves in Fig. 4 represent our modeling results. We found that diﬀerent couples of Edes and Edi f exist that lead to a good
ﬁt of the data. If Edes is high, the plateaus tend to appear at high temperature, while if Edes value is reduced, then the plateaus shift
towards lower temperatures. Also Edi f aﬀects the position of the plateaus, but this eﬀect is smaller. Increasing Edi f also shifts the
plateaus towards high temperatures. It is therefore possible to get a reasonable ﬁt for several combinations of Edes and Edi f . Fig. 5
shows the possible set of values of the Edes–Edi f pairs that are able to reproduce our experimental values. In the Edes vs. Edi f graph,
the coloured bands represent the regions where the χ2 lies within 10% of its minimum. We discarded the values of diﬀusion energy
lower than 500 K for O atoms, since thermal diﬀusion should not be below this value at low temperatures (Congiu et al. 2014).
On the other hand, in the upper region of the bands, high values are systematically eliminated by the ﬁlter that discards ﬁts of poor
quality.

Fig. 5. Diﬀusion energies vs. desorption energies obtained for O and N atoms (blue and green bands, respectively) on ASW ice, and
O atoms (grey band) obtained on oxidized graphite. Dotted lines represent Edi f /Edes = 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9. Open symbols represent
previous estimations of Edes for O atoms: 1350 K calculated by Bergeron et al. (2008) on pyrene; 1455 K found Ward&Price (2011)
on C2H2-coated graphite; 1840 K measured by Kimber et al. (2014) on propyne ice; 1764 K found by He et al. (2014) on amorphous
silicate; 1660 K and 1850 K measured by He et al. (2015) on porous water ice and amorphous silicate, respectively.

The bands indicating the acceptable couples of solutions are fairly elongated and almost linear. The desorption barrier is rela-
tively more constrained than the diﬀusion barrier. The slope of the bands is close to 2 for O atoms (blue and grey bands): for an
increase in 1 K of desorption energy, the diﬀusion energy rises by 2 K. Overall, Edi f /Edes ratios are between 0.5 and 0.9, as shown by
the dotted lines in Fig. 5. This is the ﬁrst experimental evidence that the value Edi f /Edes ∼ 0.5, which is usually adopted in models
of astrochemistry (Caselli et al. 2002; Cazaux & Tielens 2004; Cuppen & Herbst 2007), is a plausible choice. Our experiments also
rule out the possibility of having values of Edi f /Edes below 0.5 and above 0.9.

Table 2 gives some examples of diﬀusion-desorption energy combinations corresponding to Edi f /Edes ratios of 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9
obtained for O and N on the two substrates investigated in this work. One can adopt — according to an educated guess or a measured
value of either Edes or Edi f — any of the couples satisfying the ﬁts of Fig. 5. These are not to be considered true error bars, because
once a value of either Edes or Edi f has been chosen, the other is well constrained.

An O diﬀusion barrier in the range 690 − 1100 K (0.5<Edi f /Edes<0.7) is perfectly consistent with what we found previously
(values between 600 and 900 K) to reproduce the eﬃciency of the H2CO+O reaction (Minissale et al. 2015a). Also, desorption
energies for O are consistent with previous estimations (Bergeron et al. 2008; Ward et al. 2011; Kimber et al. 2014; He et al. 2015);
He et al. (2015) found 1850 ± 90 K on amorphous silicates and 1660 ± 60 K on porous water ice (see open-symbol points in Fig. 5).
The values of Edes we derived for O atoms on oxidized graphite cover the interval of values (1455±72 K) proposed by Ward et al.
(2011) and Kimber et al. (2014) obtained on an analogous sample, coated with C2H2. Also the theoretical value of 1350 K obtained
for physisorption of O on pyrene by Bergeron et al. (2008) is compatible with our results. Since Bergeron et al. (2008), Ward et al.
(2011), and Kimber et al. (2014) do not suggest an explicit value for the diﬀusion energy, the corresponding Edi f values displayed
in Fig. 5 were drawn according to a Edi f /Edes ratio of 0.7. The good agreement of our ﬁts with estimations of other authors, though
achieved on diﬀerent substrates, proves the reliability of the new direct method we present. Moreover, we provide the ﬁrst evaluation
of Edes and Edi f for N atoms. They are lower than the ones found for O atoms. In fact, the same diﬀerence existing between Edes and
Edi f of N and O atoms appears if one considers desorption and diﬀusion barriers of the molecular species N2 and O2. Oxygen atoms
are generally more bound to the substrate than O2 molecules, indicating that the polarizability is not the only parameter that governs
the adsorption energy. The high electronegativity of O atoms could perhaps explain that behavior. Another explanation could be that
O(3P) atoms have unpaired electrons that generate a quadrupole moment. In contrast, molecular and atomic nitrogen seem to have
adsorption energies in the same energy range.

Both substrates used in this work are amorphous and possess a complex distribution of adsorption and diﬀusion barriers.
However, the technique we used implies that the experiments are carried out under conditions of very low surface coverage, where
diﬀusion leads the atoms to occupy the minima on the surface potential. Therefore, desorption energies derived here are very likely

6

to be related to the deepest sites, which means that we probed the high-energy end of the barrier distribution. That our modeling
results ﬁt the data is a clear indication that choosing unique values for desorption and diﬀusion is a reasonable choice in our case,
notwithstanding the existence of an energy distribution.

In astrochemical models, the diﬀusion of species is very often directly and simply assumed to be linked to the desorption
energy. Because all the chemistry is ruled by diﬀusion/reaction and diﬀusion/desorption competitions, this strong hypothesis has
deep consequences. Such an assumption is also due to the poor knowledge of diﬀusion of molecules on a complex surface. Recently,
Karssemeijer&Cuppen (2014) have shown calculations on the diﬀusion of CO and CO2 on water ice surfaces. They ﬁnd that the
Edi f /Edes ratio lies within the 0.3-0.4 range, rather than between 0.5 and 0.9 as we found in this work. We cannot directly compare
their calculations with our work because, ﬁrstly, the two studies investigate diﬀerent systems and, secondly, atoms and molecules
are likely to have diﬀerent diﬀusion properties. Moreover, as we mentioned earlier, we probably probe only the high-value tail
of the distribution of binding energies and also the high end of the diﬀusion barrier distribution if the two energies are directly
coupled. However, we can limit the range for Edi f /Edes ratio by using indirect constraints on O-atom diﬀusion, derived from our
previous study of the H2CO+O system (Minissale et al. 2015a). In this case, experiments were performed on a substrate held at
55 K corresponding to a thermal-hopping-dominated regime. The substrate was ASW ice or oxidized graphite, coated with H2CO
ice. In the H2CO+O system, the key point is not the desorption vs diﬀusion competition, but diﬀusion vs reactivity. We succeeded
in reproducing our data using an O-diﬀusion barrier ranging from 600 K to 900 K. If we choose the mean value (750 K) of this
interval, and use it to constrain the results of the present paper, we have a Edi f -Edes = 750-1320 K for ASW ice and 750-1420 K
for oxidized graphite. We notice that the two Edi f /Edes ratios are 0.57 and 0.53, respectively. Therefore, in the absence of other
experimental evidence, we conclude that the most likely number to assign to the Edi f /Edes ratio is 0.55. By using this value, in the
case of N atoms, we ﬁnd Edi f -Edes = 400-720 K. We realize that the diﬀusion/desorption energy ratio of 0.55 we derive does not
come at the end of an explicit demonstration, but it is a conclusion we draw after the analysis of a series of converging facts. In the
future more evidence will be available we believe, for example thanks to extended calculations, and our proposed value will be put
to the test to verify whether it is plausible or not as far as atoms are concerned. It must be noted, however, that the Edi f /Edes = 0.55
we propose represents the reference value of current astrochemical models. Our ﬁndings show that the assumptions made in the
present codes are meaningful and reasonable, at least for the cases of O and N atoms.

4. Conclusions
In this work, we present a new method (TP-DED)of deriving desorption and diﬀusion energies of reactive species. We validated
our method by modeling the experimental values and comparing our results to previous calculations and measurements of O-atom
desorption energies. For the ﬁrst time, we provide an estimation of N-atom diﬀusion and desorption energies on ASW ice. These
ﬁndings are of major interest to astrophysicists because astrochemical models simulating solid state physics-chemistry on dust grain
surfaces will implement the new values of diﬀusion-desorption energies of O and N atoms in their codes and perhaps improve our
understanding of the observed interstellar abundances.

We discussed the empiric relation between diﬀusion and desorption barriers and conﬁrmed experimentally that 0.5 is a reason-
able choice for diﬀusion-desorption barrier ratios of atoms, showing that the initial guess by Tielens & Hagen (1982) was prophetic.
We have proposed a value of 0.55, although there may be cases where Edi f /Edes ratios ranging between 0.5 and 0.9 are a more
realistic choice for atoms. As for molecules, the 0.3 - 0.4 range derived from calculations by Karssemeijer & Cuppen (2014) has
no reason to be questioned, and we would retain it among the possible Edi f /Edes values characterizing molecular species. Here we
proposed the combination Edi f -Edes = 400-720 K for N atoms on icy mantles. The 400 K diﬀusion energy of nitrogen atoms may
have important implications for interstellar chemistry. In fact, it is low enough to allow for fast mobility at temperatures around
15 K, which is a diﬀusion rate of more than one hop per second. N atoms thus might be able to scan a large section of the grain
surface before any other accretion event occurs. On the other hand, the 720 K desorption energy value is high enough to allow for
a long residence time at the same interval of temperatures. While the N+N reaction is unlikely on dust grains, the most probable
reaction involving N atoms is N+H → NH — as was shown experimentally by Fedoseev et al. (2015) — or N+H2 (which should
have an activation barrier). As a ﬁnal speculation, we would like to emphasize that the synthesis of NH on bare grain surfaces should
lead to a high percentage (about 45%) of NH radicals released in the gas phase upon formation through the chemical desorption
process (Minissale et al 2015b).
