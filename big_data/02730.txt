Introduction

This paper is devoted to the study of kernels of pairs of linear maps. This notion extend

some tools used in systems theory, convolutional codes and Boolean networks [7], [9].

In fact if A = RZ is the R-algebra (R a ring) of sequences of elements of R; A ∈ Rn×n,

B ∈ Rn×m are matrices and σ is the shift operator σ(x(t)) = x(t + 1). Then set

ker(σI − A, B) = {(x(t), u(t)) ∈ An × Am | σ(x(t)) = x(t + 1) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)}

collects the trajectories of linear system. On the other hand, it has also been deﬁned

ker(σI − A | B) = {u(t) ∈ Am | ∃x(t) ∈ An : σ(x(t)) = x(t + 1) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)}

which is central in the deﬁnition of convolutional codes because it collects the codewords

of convolutional code deﬁned by linear system (A, B). In order to attack this problem we

are studying kernels of pairs of matrices with entries in polynomial rings R[z].

Now all along this paper R will denote a commutative ring with identity. Usually R

will be a F-algebra or even a ﬁeld. We develop our results in a general framework and

claim additional properties or structure when necessary.

Deﬁnition 1.1. Let N and Mi, i = 1, 2 be R-modules and fi : Mi → N be R-linear
maps. We deﬁne

ker(f1 | f2) = {m2 ∈ M2 | ∃m1 ∈ M1 : f1(m1) + f2(m2) = 0}

while we set

ker(f1, f2) = ker(f1 ⊕ f2 : M1 ⊕ M2 → N ) = {(m1, m2) ∈ M1 ⊕ M2 : f (m1) + f2(m2) = 0}

as usual.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 deals with main properties of ker(f1 | f2)

which follow from the fact that ker(f1 | f2) is the kernel of certain linear map and it is also

the cockernel of another linear map. We also point out several properties of ker(f1 | f2)

when maps fi have nice properties.

Section 3 is devoted to give a explicit factorization of ker(f1 | f2) in terms of usual

kernels ker(f1, f2) and ker(f1) when involved R-modules are hereditary or in particular

when commutative ring R is hereditary (that is when submodules of projective R-modules

are again projective). Note that the class of hereditary rings contains several interesting

classes of commutative rings like for instance ﬁelds, principal ideal domains, Dedekind

domains, von Neumann regular rings and Boolean rings.

Next we study scalar extensions R → S in section 4. If R-algebra S happens to be

R-ﬂat then scalar extension of ker(f1 | f2) is given by the kernel of pair of extended maps

ker(f1 ⊗ IS | f2 ⊗ IS). This fact is used extensively in section 5 to develop the case of
product rings R ∼= R1 × · · · × Rs. We conclude by giving some results related to the kernel
of pairs of polynomial matrices which are applicable both in behavioral linear systems and

convolutional codes.

2 The kernel of a pair. Deﬁnition and properties

Let R be a commutative ring; M1, M2, N are R-modules and let fj : Mj → N be R-linear
maps.

Deﬁnition 2.1. We denote by ker(f1 | f2) the subset of all m2 ∈ M2 such that there

exists m1 ∈ M1 with the property f1(m1) + f2(m2) = 0; thats to say

ker(f1 | f2) = {m2 ∈ M2 | ∃m1 ∈ M1 : f1(m1) + f2(m2) = 0} .

This is a generalization of so-called kernel of a pair of morphisms as given in [7],

[9]. Note that it is quite clear that ker(f1 | f2) is a R-submodule of M2.

It is also

straightforward that

Kernel of a pair of linear maps

Proposition 2.2. ker(f1 | f2) = f −1

2 (Im (f1)).

Proof. If m2 ∈ ker(f1 | f2) then f1(m1)+f2(m2) = 0 for some m1; that is, f2(m2) ∈ Im (f1)
or m2 ∈ f −1

2 (Im (f1))

We are also interested in presenting ker(f1 | f2) as the kernel of a R-linear map and

as the cokernel of another R-linear map. Let’s denote by pi : N → N/ Im (fi) the natural
quotient map of identity sending n 7→ n + Im (fi). Then it is straightforward that

Proposition 2.3. ker(f1 | f2) = ker(p1 ◦ f2 : M2 → N/ Im (f1))

Proof. x ∈ ker(p1 ◦ f2 : M2 → N/ Im (f1)) ⇔ f2(x) ∈ Im (f1)

On the other hand put the linear map (f1 , f2) : M1 ⊕ M2 → N sending (m1, m2) 7→

(f1 , f2)(m1, m2) = f1(m1) + f2(m2). Note that ker(f1) ⊆ ker(f1 , f2) because if m ∈

ker(f1) then f1(m) = 0; hence (f1 , f2)(m, 0) = 0 and consequently (m, 0) ∈ ker(f1 , f2).

Moreover one has

Theorem 2.4. ker(f1 | f2) = coker[ker(f1) ֒→ ker(f1 , f2)]

map ker(f1, f2)

Proof. The projection onto the second factor π2 : M1 ⊕ M2 → M2 restricts to the onto
π2−→ ker(f1 | f2) whose kernel consist of all pairs satisfying π2(x1, x2) = 0
and therefore x2 = 0 by deﬁnition of π2. So, a fortiori, f1(x1) = 0, and consequently we

are done because

ker hker(f1 , f2)

π2−→ ker(f1 | f2)i = ker(f1)

That is, the following sequence is short exact

0 → ker(f1) ֒→ ker(f1, f2) → ker(f1 | f2) → 0

m1 7→ (m1, 0)

(m1, m2) 7→ m2

The following properties of the kernel of a pair of linear maps, may be easily derived.

Proposition 2.5. Consider the R-linear maps fi : Mi → N . Denote by 0 and I respec-
tiveli the zero linear map and the identity map. Then

(i) ker(0 | f2) = ker(f2)

(ii) If f1 is onto then ker(f1 | f2) = M2

(iii) ker(0 | I) = 0

4

Carriegos, DeCastro & Mu˜noz-Casta˜neda

(iv) ker(f1 | 0) = M2

(v) In general, Im (f2) ⊆ Im (f1) ⇒ ker(f1 | f2) = M2

(vi) If Ψ2 is an automorphism of M2 then mapping m2 7→ Ψ2(m2) is an isomorphism

ker(f1 | f2Ψ2) → ker(f1 | f2)

(vii) ker(f1 | f2Ψ2) = Ψ−1

2 (ker(f1 | f2))

(viii) If Ψ1 is an automorphism of M1 then ker(f1Ψ1 | f2) = ker(f1 | f2)

(ix) If Ψ is an isomorphism of N then ker(Ψf1 | f2) = ker(f1 | Ψ−1f2)

Proof. (i), (ii), (iii) are straightforward from Proposition 2.2; (iv), (v) are directly obtained

from Deﬁnition 2.1.

Property (vi) is consequence of the fact that Ψ2 maps ker(f1 | f2Ψ2) onto ker(f1 | f2).

Since Ψ2 is injective (because it is a restriction an isomorphism) it follows that Ψ2 is itself

an isomorphism and hence the result. Property (vii) follows straightforward from (vi).

Assertion (viii) is clear because ker(f1Ψ1 | f2) = {m2 ∈ M2 | ∃m1 ∈ M1 : f1(Ψ1m1) +

f2m2 = 0}

Finally to prove (ix) note that ker(Ψf1 | f2) = {m2 ∈ M2 | ∃m1 ∈ M1 : Ψf1(m1) +
f2m2 = 0}. Deﬁning condition is equivalent to saying that f1m1 + Ψ−1f2m2 = 0 which is
the deﬁnition of ker(f1 | Ψ−1f2)

3 Hereditary rings

A R-module M is called hereditary if every submodule of M is projective. If every ideal

of R is projective (that is, R is a ring of global dimension one) then every projective R-

module is hereditary and commutative ring R is called hereditary. A hereditary integral

domain is a Dedekind domain.

Assume that R-modules Mi, N are hereditary R-modules. It follows that all R-modules

in exact sequence of Theorem 2.4

0 → ker(f1) ֒→ ker(f1, f2) → ker(f1 | f2) → 0

are projective. Therefore

Theorem 3.1. If R-modules Mi and N are hereditary (in particular if R is itself an
hereditary ring) then one has the factorization ker(f1, f2) ∼= ker(f1) ⊕ ker(f1 | f2) and,
consequently

ker(f1 | f2) ∼= ker(f1, f2)/ ker(f1)

Kernel of a pair of linear maps

Example 3.2. Put a matrix A ∈ Rn×n with no real eigenvalues and B ∈ Rn×m then one
has the isomorphism ker(zI − A | B) ∼= ker(zI − A, B). This result, translated to the case
of z = σ the shift operator in R-algebra A = RZ, implies that sequences of admissible
controls ~u(t) of linear system ~x(t + 1) = A~x(t) + B~u(t) are in bijective correspondece with

trajectories (solutions) (~x(t), ~u(t)) of linear system.

4 Scalar Extension. Base change

Assume in the sequel that S is a R-algebra with structural morphism ρ : R → S. Scalar
extension of R-module M is the S-module ρ∗(M ) = M ⊗R S, while scalar extension of
R-linear map f : M → N is given by ρ∗(f ) = f ⊗ IS : M ⊗R S → N ⊗R S.

Scalar extension functor (− ⊗R S) preserves onto linear mappings, it is right-exact
(see [1]) and hece it preserves epimorphisms. But notice that neither monomorphisms nor

kernels are conserved in general by scalar extensions; for instance take ker[2 : Z → Z] = 0
and observe that ker[2⊗ IZ/2Z : Z ⊗Z Z/2Z → Z ⊗Z Z/2Z] = ker[0 : Z/2Z → Z/2Z] = Z/2Z
A R-module (respectively R-algebra) S is ﬂat (respectively ﬂat algebra) if functor

(− ⊗R M ) happens to be exact; that is it transforms exact sequences into exact sequences.
Examples of R-ﬂat modules are free R-modules and projective R-modules [1],[2], [3] or [8].

Within these conditions one has

Theorem 4.1. If S is a ﬂat R-algebra then

ρ∗(ker(f1 | f2)) = ker(ρ∗(f1) | ρ∗(f2))

Proof. Scalar extension functor ρ∗(−) = − ⊗R S is exact because S is R-ﬂat. Hence exact
sequence

0

/ ker(f1)

ι

/ ker(f1, f2)

π /

/ ker(f1 | f2)

/ 0

yields the exact sequence

0

/ ker(f1) ⊗R S

ι⊗IS

/ ker(f1, f2) ⊗R S

π⊗IS

/ ker(f1 | f2) ⊗R S

/ 0

Once again, since S is R-ﬂat it follows the commutative square

0

0

/ ker(f1) ⊗R S

ι⊗IS

/ ker(f1, f2) ⊗R S

/ ker(f1 ⊗ IS)

ι′

/ ker(f1 ⊗ IS, f2 ⊗ IS)

and therefore ρ∗(ker(f1|f2)) = ker(f1|f2) ⊗R S = ker(f1 ⊗ IS | f2 ⊗ IS) = ker(ρ∗(f1) |
ρ∗(f2)).

5 Product rings

Now we deal with the case of R = R1 × · · · × Rt being a ﬁnite direct product of rings.
In this case each factor ring Ri ∼= eiR where ei = (0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ..., 0) is the ith structrual
idempotent of product. Hence R1 ∼= e1R ⊕ · · · ⊕ etR and therefore each factor Ri ∼= eiR is
a ﬂat R-algebra because it is projective due to it is a direct summand of the free R-module
R1. This decomposition can be traslated to kernels of pairs of linear maps:

Theorem 5.1. If πi : R1 × · · · × Rt → Ri is the projection onto ith factor, then πi is
also structural R-algebra morphism and, for a given pair of R-linear maps fj : Mj → N ,
j = 1, 2 one has

ker(f1 | f2) ∼=

M

i=1

ker(π∗

i (f1) | π∗

Proof. The universal property of product yields the natural isomorphism Φ which is unique

Now we conclude with the case of R being a ﬁnite product of ﬁelds. This case con-

tains modular rings Z/mZ where m is a square-free integer and would be of interest in

convolutional coding.

Corollary 5.2. Let Ki be a ﬁeld for each i and consider a ring R = K1 × · · · × Ks. Let
A ∈ Rp×q1 and B ∈ Rp×q2 be matrices. Then

ker(A | B) = e1 · ker(π1(A) | π1(B)) + · · · + es · ker(πs(A) | πs(B))

Notice that Theorem 2.4 applies to above case of R beign a ﬁnite product of ﬁelds,

hence one has the following result.

Corollary 5.3. Let Ki be a ﬁeld for each i and consider a ring R = K1 × · · · × Ks. Let
A ∈ Rp×q1 and B ∈ Rp×q2 be matrices. Then

ker(A | B) =

ker(π1(A), π1(B))

ker(π1(A))

ker(πs(A), πs(B))

ker(πs(A))

Above results might be explained with an example. Consider the modular integer ring
Z/30Z ∼= Z/2× Z/3Z × Z/5Z, where isomorphism is given by Chinese Remainder Theorem

(a, b, c) 7→ unique x such that x = a(mod 2), x = b(mod 3), x = c(mod 5)

Thence structural idempotents are given by:

Z/2 × Z/3Z × Z/5Z

/ Z/30

(1, 0, 0)

(0, 1, 0)

(0, 0, 1)

/ 15

/ 10

/ 6

Thus the kernel might be recovered from local data on every factor ﬁeld by using Corollary

5.2 with above structural idempotents e1 = 15, e2 = 10, and e3 = 6.

Note that this result can also be generalized to the case of polynomial matrices which

would be useful in the behavioral theory of linear systems and in particular to convolutional

codes.

Corollary 5.4. Consider matrices A(z), B(z) of adequate sizes, p × q1 and p × q2 re-

spectively, and entries in R[z] where R = R1 × · · · × Rs is a product ring with structural
idempotents ei ∈ R. Then trajectories can be computed locally and glued together; that is
to say, one has

ker(A(z) | B(z)) = {u(z) | ∃x(z) : A(z)x(z) + B(z)u(z) = 0} =

= e1 ker(π1(A)(z) | π1(B)(z)) + · · · + es ker(πs(A)(z) | πs(B)(z))

Proof. Note that R[z] = (R1 × · · · × Rs)[z] ∼= R1[z] × · · · × Rs[z] and thus Ri[z] is a ﬂat
R[z]-algebra. It only remains to detect structural morphism, which is a trivial exercise.

Then we conclude by using Theorem 5.1

To conclude note that if K is a ﬁeld then K[z] is a principal ideal domain and thus

a Dedekind domain and hence hereditary. Thus by applying Theorem 3.1 one has the

following factorization result.

Corollary 5.5. Consider matrices A(z), B(z) of adequate sizes, p × q1 and p × q2 respec-

tively, and entries in R[z] where R = K1 × · · · × Ks is a product of ﬁelds. Then

ker((A(z) | B(z)) =

ker(π1(A)(z) | π1(B)(z))

ker(π1(A)(z))

⊕ · · · ⊕

ker(π1(A)(z) | π1(B)(z))

ker(π1(A)(z))

Carriegos, DeCastro & Mu˜noz-Casta˜neda

Notice that the key point in above results is some kind of ”commutativity” between

the product of rings and extension from a ring to its ring of polynomials; that is to
say,R[z] = (R1 × · · · × Rs)[z] ∼= R1[z] × · · · × Rs[z], which assures that Ri[z] is a ﬂat
R[z]-algebra. This phenomenon is also true for the extensions to formal power series
R 7→ R[[z]]; polynomial ring R[z, z−1]; formal power series R[[z, z−1]]; Puisseux series;
and, if Ri are domains, for extensions to rational fractions R 7→ R(z) and Laurent series
R 7→ R((z)). Thus we conjecture that Theorem 5.1 could be extended to these scenarios.

To conclude it is worth to note that factorization results `a la Corollary 5.2 holds on

by assuring that factor rings Ri[z] (or respectively Ri[[z]], ...) are hereditary.
