The ﬁnite-time operation of a quantum heat engine that uses a single particle as a working medium generally
increases the output power at the expense of inducing friction that lowers the cycle efﬁciency. We propose
to scale up a quantum heat engine utilizing a many-particle working medium in combination with the use of
shortcuts to adiabaticity to boost the nonadiabatic performance by eliminating quantum friction and reducing the
cycle time. To this end, we ﬁrst analyze the ﬁnite-time thermodynamics of a quantum Otto cycle implemented
with a quantum ﬂuid conﬁned in a time-dependent harmonic trap. We show that nonadiabatic effects can be
controlled and tailored to match the adiabatic performance using a variety of shortcuts to adiabaticity. As a
result, the nonadiabatic dynamics of the scaled-up many-particle quantum heat engine exhibits no friction and
the cycle can be run at maximum efﬁciency with a tunable output power. We demonstrate our results with a
working medium consisting of particles with inverse-square pairwise interactions, that includes noninteracting
and hard-core bosons as limiting cases.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum thermodynamics resembles a fruitful crucible of research ﬁelds where foundations of physics, information science
and statistical mechanics merge [1, 2]. It is further spurred by the development of quantum technologies that have facilitated the
realization and control of thermal machines and related devices exhibiting quantum dynamics. A prominent example is that of
quantum heat engines (QHE) that transform thermal energy into mechanical work.

In both classical and quantum domains, the performance of heat engines is characterized by the efﬁciency and power of the
cycle. Studies to date have been limited to the optimization of thermodynamic cycles operating with a single-particle working
medium. After the pioneering works [3, 4], the quantum Otto cycle has been analyzed in detail [5–11]. It is of relevance to
current experimental efforts to realize a QHE with a single trapped ion [12, 13]. Nonetheless, it is worth pointing out that a
universal behavior emerges among different types of cycles in the limit of small action per cycle [14]. These works show that
when a single-particle QHE is operated in a ﬁnite amount of time, nonadiabatic excitations act as quantum friction, reducing the
efﬁciency of the engine. As a result, the maximum efﬁciency is achieved for long time cycles, in the adiabatic limit, when the
output power of the QHE vanishes. This state of affairs is already present in classical heat engines and gave rise to the ﬁeld of
ﬁnite-time thermodynamics.

Scaling up a QHE arises as a natural strategy to compensate for the tradeoff between efﬁciency and power. Yet, the analysis
of QHE with a many-particle working medium remains essentially unexplored. Only recently a few results have been reported
[11, 15–18]. In particular, the efﬁciency of an adiabatic QHE operating an Otto cycle with noninteracting bosons and fermions
has been studied in [11]. It was shown that signatures of quantum statistics are only relevant when the working medium is
conﬁned in an anharmonic trap, with an inhomogeneous energy level spacing. More recently, we analyzed a nonadiabatic
quantum Otto cycle with an inﬁnite family of quantum ﬂuids as a working medium. Under harmonic conﬁnement, it was shown
that nonadiabatic many-particle quantum effects can enhance the efﬁciency of the cycle operating at maximum output power
by up to 50% of the single-particle counterpart [15]. This enhancement was demonstrated in the limit of very fast driving,
with a sudden trap-frequency change accounting for the compression and expansion strokes. Further efforts in many-particle
thermodynamics have shown that the performance of a heat engine can be boosted when the working substance is in the vicinity
to a phase transition, an effect that holds in the classical case [19].

An alternative approach to boost the performance of QHE resorts on the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA), that mimic
adiabatic dynamics without the requirement of slow driving [20]. STA constitute a disruptive paradigm in ﬁnite-time thermody-
namics that avoids the need to sacriﬁce efﬁciency for power. This is achieved by tailoring excitations during the nonequilibrium
process. STA applicable to the expansion and compression strokes often used in thermodynamic cycles have been extensively
studied in recent years, both theoretically [21–33] and experimentally with ultracold atomic gases [34, 35]. The development of
STA applicable to many-body systems has been reported in [27, 29, 36–41] and further demonstrated in the laboratory [42]. At
the single-particle level, the application of STA to quantum thermodynamics was pioneered in [9, 10]. It was shown that STA
can assist the ﬁnite-time operation of a QHE with a single trapped particle as a working medium to achieve a tunable output
power and zero friction. Similar applications have been discussed in quantum refrigerators [22].

In this manuscript, we combine both strategies to engineer a scaled-up many-particle QHE whose operation is assisted by
STA to boost its performance, maximizing its efﬁciency and enhancing the output power. In particular, we analyze the ﬁnite-
time thermodynamics of a QHE with a quantum ﬂuid as a working medium. For the latter, we consider an inﬁnite family of
scale-invariant many-body systems conﬁned in a time-dependent harmonic trap. We show that the nonequilibrium dynamics

of the many-particle thermodynamic cycle can be engineered via STA to run the QHE with zero friction. The enhancement
of the output power arises from the many-particle nature of the working medium and the reduced cycle time. The resulting
many-particle QHE operates at the maximum possible efﬁciency which is shared by classical and quantum heat engines as an
upper bound.

II. MODELING A MANY-PARTICLE QUANTUM HEAT ENGINE

A. Trapped quantum ﬂuids as working media

We introduce a generalization of the single-particle QHE to the many-particle case in which the working medium consists of
a quantum ﬂuid that is conﬁned in a time-dependent harmonic trap [15]. In particular, we focus on a broad family of quantum
many-body systems described by the Hamiltonian

where N is the total number of particles and ω(t) is the trap frequency of the isotropic harmonic conﬁnement. The only condi-
tion imposed on the pairwise interaction is that it is a homogeneous function of degree −2, i.e., V (br) = b−2V (r). Therefore,
Hamiltonian (1) accounts for a wide variety of many-body systems that include free noninteracting gases, quantum ﬂuids with
hard-core interactions, inverse-square interactions models, and Bose gases with s-wave contact interactions in two spatial dimen-
sions (d = 2), among other prominent examples. We note that under a modulation of the trapping frequency ω(t), the unitary
dynamics generated by (1) is governed by scale-invariance [43]. As a result, the time-evolution of a many-particle eigenstate Ψ
with energy ε at t = 0 reads [15, 36]

For the sake of illustration, we shall consider the harmonic Calogero-Sutherland model (CSM) as an speciﬁc instance of
Hamiltonian (1). The CSM describes bosons conﬁned in a time-dependent harmonic trap with inverse-square two-body interac-
tions [45, 46],

where λ is the strength of the two-body interactions. While the many-body eigenstates are always symmetric under permutation
of the particle coordinates and Pauli’s exchange statistics is bosonic for all values of λ , the CSM represents an ideal gas of
noninteracting particles obeying generalized (or fractional) exclusion statistics, a concept introduced by Haldane [47] and further
extended by Wu [48]. In particular, for λ = 0 the CSM reduces to the trapped ideal Bose gas. Similarly, for λ = 1 the CSM is
equivalent to a one dimensional gas of bosons in the Tonks-Girardeau regime [49, 50] that obeys Fermi exclusion statistics as a
result of the hard-core interactions. Therefore, when λ = 1 the occupation number of a single particle state (e.g of the trap) is
restricted to the values {0,1} and the thermodynamics in this regime is identical to that of noninteracting spin-polarized trapped
fermions. As an upshot, the CSM allows one to account for the thermodynamics of non-interacting bosons and fermions on
the same footing, given that it is governed by the exclusion statistics as opposed to the exchange statistics. More generally, for
values of λ other than 0 and 1 the CSM describes an ideal gas of Haldane anyons or “geons”, particles with fractional exclusion
statistics [51]. In the canonical ensemble, an explicit computation of the equilibrium mean-energy of a thermal state of the CSM
yields

B. Quantum Otto cycle and fundamental limits

(10)

(11)

In the Otto cycle isentropic and isochoric strokes alternate with each other, as illustrated in Figure 1. There are two isentropes
and two isochores per cycle, where energy in the form of work (W ) and heat (Q) is transferred from and into the heat engine.
In order of alternation these are: isentropic compression (W1), hot isochore (Q2), isentropic expansion (W3) and cold isochore
(Q4). The isentropic strokes involve a change in the trapping frequency at constant temperature while during an isochore the
temperature varies and the frequency is kept constant. The efﬁciency of a heat engine is deﬁned as the total output work per
input heat

(12)
where (cid:104)W1(3)(cid:105) = (cid:104)H(cid:105)B(D) −(cid:104)H(cid:105)A(C) and (cid:104)Q2(4)(cid:105) = (cid:104)H(cid:105)C(A) −(cid:104)H(cid:105)B(D). The heat engine is decoupled from the thermal reservoir
during the isentropic strokes, when the dynamics is unitary. We use the scaling dynamics of the working medium (9) to predict
the mean energy according to (5). The efﬁciency of the many-particle quantum heat engine run in ﬁnite time is given by

driving protocols such that ω(0) = ω1 and ω(τ) = ω2 in the compression stroke and with ω(0) = ω2 and ω(τ(cid:48)) = ω1 in the
expansion stroke. For a monotonous frequency, we have that Q∗(τ) → Q∗

given protocol ω(t), τ ∈ [0, +∞] approaches then a smooth representation of the step function (e.g. ω1θ (−t) + ω2θ (t) for the
compression). In addition, as proved in [15], the efﬁciency (13) is bounded by an non-adiabatic Otto limit independently of the

This formula encodes the “tragedy of ﬁnite-time thermodynamics” in the many-particle setting: The maximum efﬁciency is
achieved under slow driving, in the adiabatic limit, when the QHE operates at vanishing output power −((cid:104)W1(cid:105) +(cid:104)W3(cid:105))/τc as a
result of the requirement for a long cycle time τc. By contrast, realistic engines operated in ﬁnite time achieve a ﬁnite output
power at the cost of introducing nonadiabatic energy excitations that represent quantum friction and lower the efﬁciency. That
nonadiabatic effects generally decrease the engine efﬁciency follows from the fact that Q∗

AB(CD) ≥ 1.

C. Optimization of power and efﬁciency

1. General method

We ﬁrst provide a general method to optimize the power of the QHE for any ﬁnite-time protocol, that will prove useful in

deriving both analytical and numerical results. As a shorthand, we introduce the ratio of trap frequencies

(21)

We note that for an adiabatic protocol NF = 1, while for a sudden quench driving we have NF = x2. Further, for an adiabatic
protocol in the high temperature regime, the mean energy (cid:104)H(cid:105)A in equation (20) is effectively shifted by the ground energy-like
term −E0(N,λ ) + E0(N,1/2), that is due to the expansion of (cid:104)H(cid:105)C in equation (19) at high temperature.
In [15], it has been shown that for the sudden quench regime the efﬁciency at optimal power can be drastically enhanced for
large number of particles, when σc(h) ≡ N¯hβc(h)ω1(2) > 1 is achieved at relatively low temperatures, keeping σc(h) (cid:28) N. In this
regime, one can write an explicit approximation for the total work per cycle

reaching a minimum at σ = σ0(λ ) and increases monotonically for larger values of σ. One can interpret the function µλ (σc(h))
as the quantum deviation of the mean energy (cid:104)H(cid:105)A(C) from its classical value N/βc(h). For any given protocol, equation (22)
allows one to compute the optimal frequency ratio x that maximizes the work done per cycle.

2. Optimizing adiabatic output power

In this section we assume that the adiabaticity condition is fulﬁlled for a ﬁxed value of the duration of the strokes τ. Optimizing
the output power is then equivalent to maximizing the output work. We shall provide expressions for the maximum adiabatic

where µ1/2(σc) is greater than 1 and increases monotonically with σc. Consequently, the efﬁciency is lesser than the Curzon-

From the comparison of these limiting cases, it is found that in the adiabatic limit the efﬁciency and total work output are
maximized in the classical regime when both the cold and hot reservoirs are at high temperature, e.g., σc(h) (cid:28) 1. It is in this
regime that it is most convenient to operate the scaled-up QHE, avoiding quantum corrections that lower the performance. The
work per cycle is then scaled by a factor of N with respect to the single-particle QHE and the efﬁciency is then set by the
Curzon-Alhborn efﬁciency, according to Eqs. (27a)-(27b). Next, we discuss how to achieve this adiabatic performance under
nonadiabatic STA protocols that shorten the cycle operation time.

III. SUPERADIABATIC MANY-PARTICLE QUANTUM HEAT ENGINES

As discussed in the introduction, it has recently been shown that it is possible to boost the performance of a single-particle
QHE by reducing the cycle time, replacing the compression and expansion strokes of a quantum Otto cycle by STA protocols
[8, 10]. In what follows we shall explore the optimization of the ﬁnite-time thermodynamics of a many-particle QHE using the
STA for many-body systems [27, 29, 36–42] to engineer a scale-up many-particle QHE operating at maximum efﬁciency and
with high output power. We shall introduce two different approaches depending on the given speciﬁcations of the many-particle
QHE.

A. First approach: Finite-time optimization and accidental STA

Consider the operation of the many-particle QHE with given cold and hot thermal reservoirs at ﬁxed (inverse) temperatures βc
and βh. Assuming that a speciﬁc time-dependent protocol ω(t) describes the evolution of the working medium, the conditions for

7

optimal performance can be determined by maximizing the output power for a variable and ﬁnite duration τ of the compression
and expansion strokes. The duration of the isochores constitutes an overhead that adds to the total cycle time τc and plays no
role in our analysis. The possibility to engineer a superadiabatic many-particle QHE with zero friction relies on the existence
of protocols ω(t) during which the nonadiabatic dynamics becomes adiabatic at a speciﬁc set of values for the duration of the
strokes {τn, n = 1,2,3, . . .} which depends on the frequencies ω1, ω2 of the trap. We refer to any such instance as an accidental
STA.

To illustrate this approach we ﬁrst introduce an accidental STA protocol that interpolates between the adiabatic and the sudden
quench limit (τ = 0). In particular, we choose a modulation of the trap frequency for which the adiabaticity coefﬁcient ˙ω/ω2
[54] remains constant during the compression and expansion strokes [55, 56]. The condition | ˙ω(t)/ω(t)2| = 2γ−1 with γ > 0, is
satisﬁed by the time-dependent frequencies

(29a)
(29b)
where ω1,ω2,t1,t2 and τ are ﬁxed by the boundary conditions ωAB(0) = ω1, ωAB(τ) = ω2, and ωCD(0) = ω2, ωCD(τ) = ω1,
leading to t1 = (1−ω1/ω2)τ and t2 = (ω1/ω2)t1. Notice that the protocol is symmetric ωCD(t) = ωAB(τ −t) and can be rewritten
as ωCD(t) = ω1ω2τ/(ω1τ +t(ω2 −ω1)). The dimensionless parameter γ is given by γ = 2ω1t1 and can be directly related to the
duration of the stroke

ωAB(t) = ω1t1/(t1 −t), t ∈ [0,τ],
ωCD(t) = ω2t2/(t +t2), t ∈ [0,τ],

nonadiabatic factor decreases monotonically from the sudden quench value to a lower one that is still above unity. In Fig. 2 one
can see that the efﬁciency behaves as in a sudden-quench protocol, see also Figure 3(b) to see the relation with the nonadiabatic
factor. Yet, for γ > 1 (or equivalently τ > (1− x)/(2ω1)) the nonadiabatic factor oscillates above the adiabatic value, see Figure
3(b). At the contact points (obtained in [55, 56] by a different method) γn = (1 +4π2n2/ln (x)2)1/2, with n = 1,2,3 . . ., we ﬁnd a
STA given that nonadiabatic factor equals unity, Q∗ = 1. At these points, the work as well as the efﬁciency reproduce the values

FIG. 2. Efﬁciency of a many-particle QHE run in ﬁnite-time at optimal power. Top panels (a)-(c) display the efﬁciency of a many-particle
QHE at maximum power as a function of βh/βc for the accidental protocol (acc) with τ = 1.5/ω1, a sudden quench (sq), and adiabatic driving
(ad). The interaction strength takes values λ = 0,1,2 from left to right and N = 500. A similar representation as a function of τ, in units of
ω−1
is done in the bottom panels (d)-(f), where βh/βc = 0.3. In both representations, a transition is observed from the sudden-quench to the

as required for a STA protocol.
Concerning many-particle effects, we point out that the efﬁciency at optimal power can be enhanced drastically for τ ≤ 1/ω1 if
λ = 0 (a similar conclusion holds for λ (cid:28) 1, typically λ < 0.1) where 1/ω1 characterizes the transition between sudden-quench
to adiabatic regime. Indeed, taking τ > 1/ω1 the nonadiabatic many-particle efﬁciency at optimal power becomes closer to the
adiabatic efﬁciency at optimal power, see Fig. 2.

1 < τ < τ1, where τ(cid:48)

Surprisingly the nonadiabatic efﬁciency at optimal output power can beat the adiabatic value for τ(cid:48)

1 and
τ1 refer respectively to the ﬁrst and the second intersection between the nonadiabatic and adiabatic efﬁciency, see Figure 2.
This effective enhancement can be explained by the fact that the optimal value of ω1/ω2 is smaller in the adiabatic case, for
τ(cid:48)
1 < τ < τ1. However, the nonadiabatic efﬁciency is still bounded by the Otto limit, that is the adiabatic efﬁciency evaluated for
the same frequency ratio. As we mentioned above, in Figure 2, we ﬁnd that for τ = τ1 as well as for τ = τ(cid:48)
1, the efﬁciency at
output power of the nonadiabatic protocol equals the value of an adiabatic protocol. For this to happen τ1 and τ(cid:48)
1 do not need to
correspond to a proper STA with a nonadiabatic factor equal to 1. Indeed, τ(cid:48)
1 (ﬁrst intersection) does not. To ﬁnd out the value
of the minimum adiabatic shortcut time, one has to ﬁnd the optimal ratio of frequency for an adiabatic protocol (following the
approach described in section II C 2) and substitute this value into equation (32) taking n = 1. We can verify numerically that τ1
is the ﬁrst accidental STA. For τ = τ(cid:48)
1, the nonadiabatic efﬁciency the scaled-up QHE matches the adiabatic value yet Q∗ > 1.

B. Second approach: Adiabatic optimization and STA

In this section we introduce an alternative approach to boost the performance of a many-particle QHE via STA. It exploits
the possibility of engineering a STA that mimics an adiabatic expansion and compression stroke in an arbitrary ﬁxed amount
of time τ, between any two values of the frequency of the trap, ω1 and ω2. This allows one to opt ﬁrst for an optimization of
the QHE parameters assuming the dynamics to be adiabatic. In particular, for given temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs,
the frequency ratio is chosen to maximize the adiabatic output power. This boils down to maximize the total work per cycle
as the time of the compression and expansion strokes is ﬁxed, see section II C 2. The assumption of adiabatic dynamics is
then effectively fulﬁlled by replacing the adiabats by STA protocols. This second approach is more versatile as the duration of
the unitary strokes is not restricted to speciﬁc values and can be prescheduled. We shall consider three different techniques to
engineer the required STA.

9

1. Reverse engineering of the scaling dynamics

One can formulate a general theory of STA thanks to the consistent description of the dynamics given by (3) and (6). Indeed,

if one assume that there exists a time τ such that the scaling factor b(t) satisﬁes the boundary conditions [23, 36]

b(0) = 1, ˙b(0) = 0, ¨b(0) = 0,
b(τ) = bad, ˙b(τ) = 0, ¨b(τ) = 0,

(35a)
(35b)

then it follows that

(36)
In particular, this is consistent with the boundary conditions that ω(t) must satisfy in the Ermarkov equation (3) that we rewrite
as

Q∗(τ) = 1.

ω(t)2 =

ω2
0

b(t)4 − ¨b(t)

b(t)

,

(37)

and where ω(t) is the solution of the equation above with ω(0) = ω0 and ω(τ) = ω0/b2
ad.

The conditions given by equations (35a) and (35b) are satisﬁed if the scaling factor takes the following form

b(t) = 1 + a3t3 + a4t4 + a5t5 ,

(38)
where a3 = 10(bad − 1)/τ3, a4 = −15(bad − 1)/τ4, and a5 = 6(bad − 1)/τ5, see [23, 36]. However, from equation (37) it is not
clear whether ω(t) is real for all t ∈ [0,τ]. There must be a condition on τ (for ω0 and bad ﬁxed) to ensure the positivity of ω(t)2.
It is sufﬁcient to require ¨b(t)b(t)3 ≤ ω2
0 , ∀t ∈ [0,τ] that leads to a non-trivial polynomial equation. A numerical analysis shows
there exists a unique solution τc such that ∀τ > τc and ∀t ∈ [0,τ] we have ω(t)2 ≥ 0. This approach generalizes the one pursued
to boost the performance of a single-particle QHE in [10].

Eq. (38) is one instance of STA constructed via reverse engineering of the scaling dynamics. The protocol deﬁned by Eqs.
(29a)-(29b) also satisﬁes the conditions (35a) and (35b), see Appendix A. Following this observation, one can construct many
other driving protocols leading to accidental STA such as

(cid:27)

(cid:19)

b(t) = 1 + β

sin

,

(39)

with β = (1 − bad)/(2nπ) where n ≥ 1 is an integer and where the corresponding adiabatic shortcut times are τn = 2nπt0.
For the corresponding protocol obtained via (37), ω(t) need not be real (as ω(t)2 can be negative). For example, consider
t0 = 1/(2απω1) where α > 0 is a positive real number. Then ω(t)2 ≥ 0, ∀t ∈ [0,τ] for 2 ≤ α ≤ 2.75 if x ≡ ω1/ω2 ≤ 0.1.
Therefore, this protocol can beat the lower bound for the protocol deﬁned by equations (29a)-(29b), for very small frequency
ratio ω1 (cid:28) ω2. It is worth mentioning that after exact numerical computation, we ﬁnd that τ1 ≤ 1/ω1 for all values of x and
is also less than the minimal time for STA found in (32) (obtained with n = 1). Actually, if one considers τ and ω1(2) ﬁxed,
equation (39) along with equation (37) deﬁne a unique protocol (assuming ω(t)2 > 0 for all t ∈ [0,τ]), with t0 being the solution
of the equation ω(τ) = ω2. In this case, we ﬁnd another instance for which the minimum time for having a STA is smaller than
the one required for the existence of an accidental STA described in section III A, see equation (32).

2. Counterdiabatic driving (CD)

Demirplak and Rice introduced a formalism to mimic the adiabatic dynamics of a quantum system by assisting the evolution
with counterdiabatic driving ﬁelds [57]. An equivalent approach was developed independently by Berry [58]. The technique is
known as counterdiabatic driving (CD) and also referred to as transitionless quantum driving. It was extended to many-body
systems in [38–41]. For a single-particle QHE the use of CD was discussed in [9]. We next consider the performance of a
many-particle QHE assisted by STA based on CD.

Let the instantaneous eigenvalue problem of the working-medium Hamiltonian with ω = ω(t) read

In its original formulation, CD ensures that the adiabatic approximation

This is, given an initial state the dynamics generated by the CD Hamiltonian ˆHCD = ˆH + ˆH1 is exactly given by the adiabatic
approximation to ˆH[ω(t)]. CD removes the requirement of slow driving while the norm of the auxiliary CD term increases with
decreasing running time [38, 59]. Further, we note that the auxiliary term generally involves multiple-body interactions whose
experimental realization is challenging [38, 41]. However, in the presence of scaling dynamics a remarkable simpliﬁcation
occurs; not only ˆH1 can be computed in a closed form without the use of the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian as an input,
but it takes the form of a one-body counterdiabatic term [39]. For the working medium (9) the driving Hamiltonian is

3. Local counterdiabatic driving (LCD)

The experimental implementation of the squeezing operator ∝ ∑i{zi, pi} required as a counterdiabatic term discussed in the
previous section, understood either as a auxiliary external control or as part of the intrinsic Hamiltonian describing the working
medium, is generally a challenging task. As a result, it is natural to look for a unitarily equivalent Hamiltonian in which the
counterdiabatic term is mapped to a local potential. This has been achieved for a large family of many-body systems with scale-
invariant dynamics [39, 40], as well as in the single-particle case [26]. The Hamiltonian (9) belongs to such family. In this case,

IV. CONCLUSION

Finite-time thermodynamics aims at optimizing the nonadiabatic performance of thermal machines, required for any realistic
application. Conditions for optimal performance generally depend on the speciﬁc characteristics of the working medium such
as the number of particles and the interaction strength. At the quantum level the required optimization involves tailoring thermal
and quantum ﬂuctuations. The maximum efﬁciency can be reached in the limit of slow driving, at the expense of a vanishing
output power.

We have proposed to scale up quantum heat engines by using a many-particle working medium in combination with shortcuts
to adiabaticity, to simultaneously amplify the output power and match the adiabatic performance in a ﬁnite cycle time. The
resulting heat engine operates with zero friction at the maximum efﬁciency and exhibits an enhanced output power as a result
of the many-particle nature of the working medium and the reduced cycle time. The maximum efﬁciency is then set by the
adiabatic Otto upper bound shared by both single and many-particle heat engines. This scheme can be implemented realizing a
quantum Otto cycle with an interacting trapped Bose or Fermi gas with a suitable modulation of the harmonic trap. Our results
provide a new avenue for engineering nonadiabatic friction-free scalable thermal machines that should ﬁnd applications at the
interface of quantum thermodynamics and energy science.

1. Derivation of the scaling factor b(t)

The scaling factor b(t) is given by the following formula [15, 60]

(A1)
For the sake of simplicity we put φt = 1−t/t1, which leads to ∂tφt = −1/t1 and φt=τ = x. The two fundamental solutions are

G1(t)2 + ω(0)2G2(t)2, for t > 0.

to notice that for small t the Taylor expansion has a similar form to that in equation (38).
