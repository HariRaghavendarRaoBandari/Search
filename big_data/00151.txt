Abstract

We argue that massless gravitons in all even dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetimes higher than two admit a

linear memory eﬀect arising from their propagation inside the null cone. Assume that gravitational waves (GWs)
are being generated by an isolated source, and over only a ﬁnite period of time ηi ≤ η ≤ ηf. Outside of this
time interval, suppose the shear-stress of the GW source becomes negligible relative to its energy-momentum

and its mass quadrupole moments settle to static values. We then demonstrate, the transverse-traceless (TT)

GW contribution to the perturbation of any dS4+2n written in a conformally ﬂat form (a2ηµνdxµdxν) – after

the source has ceased and the primary GW train has passed – amounts to a spacetime constant shift in the

ﬂat metric proportional to the diﬀerence between the TT parts of the source’s ﬁnal and initial mass quadrupole

moments. As a byproduct, we present solutions to Einstein’s equations linearized about de Sitter backgrounds

of all dimensions greater than three. We then point out there is a similar but approximate tail induced linear

GW memory eﬀect in 4D matter dominated universes. Our work here serves to improve upon and extend the

4D cosmological results of [1], which in turn preceded complementary work by Bieri, Garﬁnkle and Yau [2] and

by Kehagias and Riotto [3].

INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION

Consider two test masses sweeping out their respective (not necessarily geodesic) world lines in a (d >

3)-dimensional spatially ﬂat Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)-like universe, namely one

described by the geometry

¯gµνdxµdxν ≡ a[η]2ηµνdxµdxν,

ηµν ≡ diag [1,−1, . . . ,−1] ,

xµ ≡ (x0, xi) ≡ (η, (cid:126)x).

Suppose a gravitational wave passes by, perturbing the geometry to become

gµνdxµdxν ≡ (¯gµν + hµν) dxµdxν

≡ a[η]2 (ηµν + χµν[η, (cid:126)x]) dxµdxν.

Denote the proper geodesic length between the two masses at a ﬁxed time η to be L[η]. A direct

calculation, reviewed in appendix (A), would then reveal that the presence of such a GW would, at

leading order, yield a fractional distortion of this proper length proportional to χij.

Euclidean space joining one test mass at (cid:126)X(cid:48) to the other at (cid:126)X. Furthermore, if after the source of the

GWs has ceased and the primary GW train has gone by, the perturbation χij does not die down to zero

amplitude, but settles instead to a non-zero constant matrix Cij, we see that the fractional distortion

(6)

This permanent displacement of test masses after the passage of a GW is known as the memory eﬀect.

In this paper we shall focus primarily on background de Sitter (dS) spacetimes ¯gµν of dimensions

greater than 3. Written in conformally ﬂat coordinates the metric is given by

¯gµνdxµdxν = a[η]2ηµνdxµdxν,

a[η] ≡ − 1
Hη

,

η ∈ (−∞, 0),

(7)

where H > 0 is the Hubble parameter describing the acceleration of an expanding universe. The main

thrust of this work is to argue that, the portion of GWs traveling inside the null cone of its source –

commonly known as its tail – would give rise to a memory eﬀect in even dimensions higher than 2. As

2

we shall see, this phenomenon is intimately tied to the fact that the tail part of the minimally coupled

massless scalar Green’s function in dS4+2n, for n zero or a positive integer, is a spacetime constant.

One may ask why a 4D physicist should be interested in physics of other dimensions. One answer is

that d, the dimension of spacetime, may be viewed as a parameter in the equations of physics, including

that of Einstein gravity. By varying d we may gain insight into questions of principle, and even acquire

new means to calculate 4D physics. An example is that of the tail eﬀect itself: even though massless

ﬁelds/particles propagate strictly on the light cone in 4D ﬂat spacetimes, they no longer do so in 2 and

odd dimensions. Moreover, it is possible to understand why tails exist in odd dimensional ﬂat spacetime

by embedding it in one higher dimensional Minkowski [4]. This has prompted further generalizations

to de Sitter spacetime [5], which can be viewed as a hyperboloid situated in one higher dimensional

ﬂat spacetime. Speciﬁcally, the causal structure of the de Sitter scalar Green’s function can be related

to that of signals generated by an appropriately deﬁned line source in the ambient ﬂat spacetime. In

addition, recent work [6] has drawn connections between the (better known) GW memory eﬀect in

asymptotically Minkowskian spacetime and the low frequency limit of the Ward-Takahashi identities

obeyed by GW scattering amplitudes, which in turn is a consequence of the Bondi-van der Burg-

Metzner-Sachs (BMS) symmetry at null inﬁnity. Does an analogous relationship hold in cosmological

spacetimes, or does it break down because the tail induced memory eﬀect described here is timelike

instead of null? These questions have ﬁrst been raised in [1], and subsequently in [3]; because it is

one based on symmetry, it ought to be examined in all possible dimensions in order to understand the

breadth of its validity.

In §(II) we work out Einstein’s equations with a non-zero cosmological constant, linearized about a
de Sitter background of dimensions greater or equal to four. We then express the metric perturbations

as appropriate retarded Green’s functions convolved against the energy-momentum-shear-stress tensor
of the source(s). Following that, in §(III) we take a detour to deﬁne the mass and pressure quadrupole
moments of an isolated GW source in a spatially ﬂat FLRW universe, and then relate linear combi-

nations of their time derivatives to the spatial-volume integral of the shear-stress of the same source.
We then employ these results in §(IV), and describe how the solutions laid out in §(II) lead us to a
linear GW memory eﬀect exhibited by the tensor mode, after the source has settled down. In §(V)
we re-visit some results obtained in [1] and comment on their implications for the linear GW memory
eﬀect in 4D cosmologies. We summarize and discuss future directions in §(VI). In appendix §(A) we
review the calculation of spatial geodesic distances between a pair of test masses in a perturbed spa-
tially ﬂat FLRW-like universe. In appendix §(B) we delineate the solutions of the partial diﬀerential

3

equations arising from General Relativity linearized about a background de Sitter spacetime. Despite

being an appendix, this section is the technical heart of the paper. Finally, in appendix (C) we identify
the gauge-invariant metric perturbation variables in a (d ≥ 4)-dimensional background spatially ﬂat
FLRW geometry.

II. GENERAL RELATIVITY WITH Λ, LINEARIZED ABOUT (DE SITTER)d≥4

Einstein’s equations for the metric gµν, sourced by the energy-momentum-shear-stress tensor Tµν of

some matter source, is

Gµν[g] − Λgµν = Rµν[g] − 1
2

gµνR[g] − Λgµν = 8πGNTµν.

(8)

GN is Newton’s gravitational constant in d dimensions. We are including a positive cosmological

constant Λ > 0 because mounting astrophysical evidence points to its existence in the 4D universe we

reside in. Moreover, for this paper, we will assume that Tµν describes an isolated, compact astrophysical

system which does not distort the overall geometry too much. When we neglect its inﬂuence (i.e., set

Tµν = 0) we recover the pure de Sitter spacetime in eq. (7), which in turn solves

Gµν[¯g] − Λ¯gµν = 0.

(9)

Our approach to solving eq. (8) is then a perturbative one, through eq. (4), by expanding the geometry

about ¯gµν.

General Perturbation Theory (PT)

To this end, it is convenient to work with the barred

graviton, namely

When ¯gµν = ηµν in 4D, this ¯hµν is more commonly known as the “trace-reversed” graviton. Equivalently,

hµν ≡ hµν − ¯gµν
2

¯gαβhαβ.

(10)

from eq. (4), we may deﬁne

χµν ≡ χµν − ηµν
2

ηαβχαβ.

(11)

Without specializing to the perturbed FLRW form in eq.

(4), any expansion about some general

(12)

(cid:16)(cid:3)¯hµν − ∇{µ∇α¯hν}α + ¯gµν∇α∇β

background metric ¯gµν given in eq. (3) would yield the following left hand side of Einstein’s eq. (8):

In eq.
Rµανβ[¯g] – and the covariant derivative ∇ are built solely out of the background ¯gµν; moreover, all indices
are moved with it. The symmetrization symbol {. . .} is deﬁned through the relation T{αβ} ≡ Tαβ +Tβα.
Now, if we do specialize to ¯gµν being the d dimensional de Sitter metric in

PT about dSd≥4

eq. (7), which satisﬁes eq. (9), the ﬁrst line on the right hand side of eq. (12) vanishes. We then use

the maximally symmetric form that the de Sitter geometric tensors take, namely

Rµναβ[¯g] = −

To solve Einstein’s eq.

(8) perturbatively, we need to choose a gauge for the barred graviton ﬁeld

hαβ, so that its wave operator can be inverted and its solution written as a convolution of appropriate

Green’s functions against the sources 8πGNTαβ.

We now require ¯hαβ to satisfy the gauge condition

We highlight here that, these solutions in eq. (37) amount to the convolution of −16πGNTij/a2 against
the minimally coupled massless scalar Green’s function in de Sitter spacetime. As we shall witness, the
latter’s spacetime constant tail in even (d ≥ 4)-dimensional spacetime is responsible for contributing to
the linear GW memory eﬀect.

III. MASS AND PRESSURE QUADRUPOLE MOMENTS; CONSERVATION LAWS IN A

SPATIALLY FLAT FLRW SPACETIME

Before examining this tail induced linear GW memory eﬀect arising from the even d ≥ 4 solutions
in eq. (37), however, we need to ﬁrst – following [8] and [9] – relate spatial-volume integrals of the

shear-stress Tij of the isolated matter source to its mass Qij and pressure Pij quadrupole moments.

Quadrupole moments

Throughout this section, unless otherwise indicated, we will suppose

our background metric is a spatially ﬂat FLRW universe, i.e., not necessarily de Sitter:

¯gµνdxµdxν = a[η]2ηµν.

We then note that the d-beins {εµ(cid:98)α} of such a spacetime, whose deﬁning property is

εµ(cid:98)αεν(cid:98)β

¯gµν = ηαβ,

(40)

(41)

are given by

The (upper) µ index of εµ(cid:98)ν transforms as a coordinate vector; while its (lower)(cid:98)ν index transforms as a

local Lorentz 1-form. Therefore we can form from Tµν the d × d matrix of coordinate scalar quantities

(42)

εµ(cid:98)ν = a−1δµ

ν.

T(cid:98)α(cid:98)β ≡ εµ(cid:98)αεν(cid:98)β

Tµν = a−2Tαβ.

(43)

The T(cid:98)0(cid:98)0 can now be interpreted as the mass-energy density measured by a local observer; T(cid:98)0(cid:98)i as its
(d − 1)-momentum density; and T(cid:98)i(cid:98)j as its shear-stress/pressure density. Moreover, from eq. (40), since
the induced metric on a constant−η hypersurface is d(cid:126)(cid:96)2 = −a2δijdxidxj, we may recognize the proper
spatial volume on the said hypersurface to be

dd−1(proper vol.)[η] = dd−1(cid:126)xad−1[η].

The physical mass and pressure quadrupole moments are now deﬁned as

IV. TAIL INDUCED LINEAR GW MEMORY EFFECT IN (DE SITTER)4+2n

We now turn our attention to the tail part of the metric perturbations in even dimensional (d ≥ 4)
de Sitter spacetime, as encoded in equations (26), (32) and (37). Despite experiencing a non-trivial

potential in higher dimensions (cf. equations (25) and (31)), the pseudo-trace(cid:101)χ and vector χ0i exhibit

no tails. The physical reason is unclear; however, the mathematical reason is that P(d−6)/2[1 + s] and
P(d−4)/2[1 + s] are respectively polynomials in s of degree ((d− 2)/2)− 2 and ((d− 2)/2)− 1. Therefore,

(We have checked the second line against the 6D light cone boundary condition in eq. (B39), i.e., it
is zero for p = (d − 4)(d − 2)/4.) In the gauge of eq. (18), it is thus only the tensor mode χij that
travels inside the light cone of its source. Moreover, the tail of its Green’s function G(T) in eq. (37) is
a constant because one is diﬀerentiating a (d − 2)/2 degree polynomial (d − 2)/2 times,

(This result follows from Rodrigues’ formula for the Legendre polynomials.) This is, of course, equivalent

to the fact that the tail of the de Sitter minimally coupled massless scalar Green’s function is a constant

the rest of this paper, we will assume that the coordinate system has been chosen such that (cid:126)x = (cid:126)x(cid:48) = 0

is located within the source. If we now invoke eq. (53) derived in the previous section, the linear GW

tail can be expressed in terms of the mass and pressure quadrupole moments of the source, at least in
the far zone (|(cid:126)x| (cid:29) |(cid:126)x(cid:48)|) where |(cid:126)x − (cid:126)x(cid:48)| ≈ |(cid:126)x| and hence ηr ≈ η − |(cid:126)x|:

Negligible shear-stress, settling of quadrupole moments
Let us suppose that the isolated
source is active only over a ﬁnite interval of time, ηi ≤ η ≤ ηf. This means we will assume that outside
this interval, its shear-stress is negligible relative to its energy-momentum, so that we may set the

former to zero, namely

Tij[η < ηi] = Tij[η > ηf] = 0.

(59)

10

This often coincides with the non-relativistic limit, achieved when a system has settled down. Equations
(59) and (46) immediately imply the pressure quadrupole moment is zero outside the interval ηi ≤ η ≤
ηf:

Pij[η < ηi] = Pij[η > ηf] = 0.

(60)

We will further assume that the mass quadrupole moment is not static only during this active interval:

˙Qij[η < ηi] = ˙Qij[η > ηf] = 0.

(61)

Altogether, equations (59), (60) and (61) applied to eq.

(58) lead us to a tail induced linear GW

memory eﬀect. Speciﬁcally for late times (ηr > ηf),1 the assumption in eq. (59) allows us to perform
the η(cid:48)−integral in eq. (57) only over ηi ≤ η(cid:48) ≤ ηf and sets to zero Pab in eq. (53); while eq. (61) puts

Therefore, after the GW source has settled down, we see that in all background dS4+2n, the Cij occurring
in the fractional distortion of eq. (5) receives contributions solely from the χ(tail)

in eq. (62).

Gravitational radiation

It is important to record here that the transverse-traceless portion of

χij is gauge-invariant, namely Dij ≡ χTT

obeys the de Sitter minimally coupled massless scalar wave equation. (For the reader’s reference, in

appendix (C) we identify the SOd−1 scalar, vector and tensor gauge-invariant metric variables in a d-

dimensional spatially ﬂat FLRW geometry.) Assuming equations (59) and (61) hold, the assertion that

the GW tail in dS4+2n remains a non-zero spacetime constant, after its source has ceased, is therefore

a coordinate-invariant and physical one.

1 The retarded time ηr ≡ η − |(cid:126)x − (cid:126)x(cid:48)| depends on (cid:126)x(cid:48) and therefore takes part in the spatial-volume integral of eq. (57).
This is why the far zone limit, replacing |(cid:126)x − (cid:126)x(cid:48)| → |(cid:126)x|, was required when transitioning to eq. (58). However, once the
source has settled down, equations (59) and (60) allow us to deduce that for ηr > ηf, eq. (58) now holds everywhere
within the future null cone of the GW source’s world tube.

11

Because the GW tail here is a constant in spacetime, notice this linear GW memory eﬀect does not
decay with distance from the source, unlike the expected 1/(spatial distance)d−3 fall-oﬀ in even (d ≥ 4)-
dimensional ﬂat spacetime. Moreover, in even dimensional Minkowski spacetimes higher than 4, linear

massless gravitons continue to propagate strictly on the null cone, like their 4D cousins. For these

reasons, the dS4+2n tail induced linear GW memory eﬀect captured in eq. (63) really has no counterpart

in the asymptotically ﬂat case.

Remark I

Before shifting our attention to 4D cosmology, we mention here that [8] advocates

exploiting the Killing vector in de Sitter spacetime

(64)
to deﬁne what it means for a GW source to settle down. (This T µ∂µ is timelike in the region x2 ≡
ηαβxαxβ > 0.) Speciﬁcally, they required that the Lie derivative of the energy-momentum-shear-stress

T µ∂µ ≡ −Hxµ∂µ

tensor Tαβ vanish outside the time interval of GW production, namely

£T Tαβ[η < ηi] = £T Tαβ[η > ηf] = 0.

(65)

In contrast, we appeared to have made stronger assumptions (equations (59) and (61)), but without

appealing to the symmetries enjoyed by de Sitter spacetime. One reason is that we wish to analyze

the more general case of spatially ﬂat FLRW-like geometries in arbitrary dimensions, where T µ∂µ in

eq. (64) is no longer a Killing vector. Moreover, we also wish to point out that eq. (65) may lead to

a potential pathology if one does not assume Tij[η > ηf] = 0 in eq. (59). This is because, a direct

calculation would show that

For later purposes, we also record the alternate form

£T Tαβ = −H (∂σ(xσTαβ) − (d − 2)Tαβ) .

Remark II

In eq. (61) we have chosen to assume, from the outset, that the mass quadrupole

moments do not evolve outside the time interval when GWs are generated. It is possible to provide

partial justiﬁcations of this assumption in de Sitter spacetime.

Let us continue to assume eq. (59) (and thus eq. (60)) but now keep the time derivative of the mass

quadrupole moment in eq. (53) when evaluating eq. (57). At late times,

Had we extended the upper limit of integration in eq.
(71) from ηf to η> > ηf, the result should
not change because Tij is zero between ηf ≤ η ≤ η>. That means a[η]−1∂0Qij[η] − 2HQij[η] =
a[ηf]−1∂0Qij[ηf] − 2HQij[ηf](= constant), whose solution is

Qij[η ≥ ηf] = Qij[ηf] +

(72)

However, as η → 0 (i.e., towards asymptotic future) it appears the physical quadrupole moment itself
will blow up unless ˙Qij[η ≥ ηf] = 0. It thus appears reasonable to demand the time derivative of the
mass quadrupole moment to vanish at late times,

˙Qij[η ≥ ηf] = 0.

(73)

Remark III

If we follow [8] and assume the static condition in eq. (65), it is then possible to

justify why both the mass and pressure quadrupole moments stay constant outside the interval of
active GW production, ηi ≤ η(cid:48) ≤ ηf. To see this we multiply xixj to the 00 component and spatial-
trace of the static condition in eq. (65), through the form of the Lie derivative in eq. (67). Proceeding

to integrate the resulting expressions over all space while employing the deﬁnitions of the mass and

pressure quadrupole moments in equations (45) and (46), we obtain

V. LINEAR GW MEMORY EFFECTS IN A 4D SPATIALLY FLAT COSMOLOGY

In this section, we elaborate on how the spatially ﬂat FLRW results in [1] lead to linear GW memory

eﬀects in an expanding 4D universe like ours. Notationally, we will say that the TT GWs split into

Dij = D(γ)

ij + D(tail)

ij

,

(77)

where D(γ)

ij are the gravitons that travel on the light cone and D(tail)

ij

are the ones traveling inside the

null cone.

On the null cone

The portion of the GW signal that transmits information on the light cone

was shown in [1] to take a form very similar to its counterpart in Minkowski spacetime:

(cid:90)

ij [η, (cid:126)x] = −4GN
D(γ)

a[η]|(cid:126)x − (cid:126)x(cid:48)| ,

ηr ≡ η − |(cid:126)x − (cid:126)x(cid:48)|.

(78)

R3

This holds for any cosmic history a[η]; and the ﬂat spacetime limit is recovered by setting a → 1. Since
T(cid:98)i(cid:98)j = a−2Tij is the physical shear-stress density of the isolated source, provided its internal dynamics

does not span cosmological timescales, we wish to assert here that all the known linear GW memory

eﬀects in 4D asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes would carry over to the asymptotically-cosmological case

at hand. For instance, T(cid:98)i(cid:98)j could describe two gravitationally unbound compact bodies ﬂying past each

other, giving rise to a “burst” of GWs [10]. The primary diﬀerence is that GWs traveling on the null

cone in a 4D spatially ﬂat universe will now be further diluted by cosmic expansion due to the scale
factor in the 1/(a[η]|(cid:126)x − (cid:126)x(cid:48)|) fall-oﬀ.

unclear why they treat Q(ρ)
ab as tensors, as indicated by their taking of the quadrupoles’ Lie derivatives. This
is most likely why they go on to state that eq. (65) “. . . does not imply that quadrupoles are left invariant by the ﬂow
generated by T a”. It is easy to misconstrue this, as if it were claiming that Q(ρ)
ab are no longer time independent
in spite of eq. (65). Instead, we do not believe the mass and pressure quadrupole moments are coordinate tensors; they
do transform covariantly under global rotations of the spatial coordinates (cid:126)x, but are otherwise merely one-parameter
(i.e., time-dependent) objects describing aspects of the GW source(s)’ internal structure.

Inside the null cone

Unlike its null cone counterpart, the detailed structure of the TT GW tail

can only be determined after its relevant wave equation is solved.

Radiation domination

In [1] we showed, in particular, that there are no radiative GW tails in

a radiation dominated universe (a[η] = η/η0) because the background Ricci scalar is zero. Therefore

linear GWs in such a cosmology, including potential memory eﬀects, are fully captured by eq. (78).

Matter domination

TT GW tail is

As already alluded to in [1], after the source has ceased (ηr > ηf), the GW tail becomes space-

independent, and like its de Sitter counterpart, does not fall oﬀ with increasing distance from the

source itself. Assuming the vanishing of shear-stress outside the time interval of active GW genesis

(i.e., eq. (59)), we have

(81)

Moreover, since the scale factor changes appreciably only over cosmological timescales (η0 ∼ 10 Gyr),
note that over the timescales of human GW experiments (<∼ decades) we may, as a good approximation,
regard the tail in eq. (81) as a spacetime constant (for ηr > ηf). Notice too, because the power of the

scale factor is 5/2, the integrand in eq. (81) cannot be converted into a total time derivative involving

the mass and pressure quadrupole moments, unlike the de Sitter case; recall eq. (52).

To sum: there is a tail induced linear GW memory eﬀect in a 4D spatially ﬂat matter dominated

FLRW universe. Its amplitude does not depend on space, but does decay over cosmological timescales

in an expanding cosmology.

de Sitter

Since we have already elaborated upon the tail induced linear GW memory eﬀect in
even dimensional d ≥ 4 de Sitter, we close this section by comparing the null cone (aka in the GR
literature as the “direct part”) versus the tail part of the TT GW in 4D. For simplicity, we shall take

15

the far zone limit in the following equations. Expressed in terms of the mass and pressure quadrupole

moments, the direct part reads

(83)

The ﬂat spacetime limit can be obtained by setting H → 0, which in turn implies replacing a → 1
and all conformal-time derivatives with Minkowski-time derivatives. Observe that the second and third

terms on the right hand sides of equations (82) and (83) are sub-dominant to the ﬁrst terms in this

limit, since they are multiplied by an additional power of H. Moreover, because of the overall H 2

multiplicative factor, the tail term of eq. (83) tends smoothly to zero as H (and hence the cosmological

constant Λ) vanishes. As already estimated in [1] – and re-conﬁrmed by dividing the right hand sides

of (83) and (82) while keeping only their ﬁrst terms – the ratio of the GW tail amplitude to that of the
direct part is roughly |D(tail)
ij | ∼ (H · ∆t)(H · a[η]|(cid:126)x|), where ∆t is the physical characteristic time
scale associated with the GW source and a|(cid:126)x| is the physical observer-source distance at the observer’s
time η. In other words, unless the GW generation process takes place at cosmological distances from

/D(γ)

ij

the observer and over cosmological timescales, the tail signal is highly suppressed whenever the direct

signal is simultaneously present.

However, if we assume that the shear-stress density becomes negligible and the quadrupole moments

settle to static values outside the time interval of active GW production – i.e., equations (59), (60) and

(61) – then, in the late time limit, ηr > ηf, the direct GW contribution from eq. (82) vanishes and

what remains is the tail part from eq. (83).

(84)

In this paper, we have improved upon and extended the 4D cosmological results of [1]. Following

Ashtekar, Bonga, and Kesavan [8] and Date and Hoque [9], we have now expressed the TT GW tails
in even (d ≥ 4)-dimensional de Sitter spacetime directly in terms of the mass and pressure quadrupole
moments of the source. Additionally, we have obtained the solutions to Einstein’s equations, with a

16

FIG. 1: (Figure borrowed from [1].) This is a spacetime diagram depicting the core collapse of a massive star,

which then goes supernova (right world line). The dashed-dotted segment of the right world line denotes the full
duration during which TT GWs are produced, corresponding to ηi ≤ η ≤ ηf in the main text. For η ≤ ηi, the
collapse has not started; afterwards, η ≥ ηf, the system has settled down completely. (We assume equations (59),
(60) and (61).) The TT GWs are heard by a distant detector (left world line). In this paper the background

geometry is either dS4+2n, a spatially ﬂat 4D FLRW radiation dominated or matter dominated universe. The

black dashed lines emanating from the worldline of the GW detector are the past light cones of events A, B and

C. The bottom pair of light gray dashed lines emanating from the right world line is the forward light cone of

the starting point of the stellar collapse; the top pair is that of the ending point. The light gray shaded region

of spacetime is ﬁlled with TT GWs propagating both on and inside the light cone. The darker-gray region of

spacetime is ﬁlled with TT GW tails only, whose detailed properties depends in principle on the entire history

or equal to four. In particular, we have shown that the 4D inside-the-null-cone linear GW memory

eﬀect found in [1], due to the spacetime constant tail of the massless TT graviton (and scalar) Green’s

function, really extends to all higher dimensional dS4+2n. We also suggested that the known linear GW

memory eﬀects in asymptotically ﬂat 4D spacetimes will carry over to the asymptotically spatially ﬂat

Even though radiation dominated universes exhibit no TT GW tails, matter dominated ones do – and

in fact, yield approximately spacetime constant GW tails that, like their de Sitter cousins, induce a

linear memory eﬀect. In Fig. (1) we summarize/illustrate our ﬁndings in sections (IV) and (V).

On a Minkowski background the energy-momentum-shear-stress (pseudo-)tensor of the GWs them-

selves source a nonlinear (aka “Christodoulou”) memory eﬀect [11]; see also [10] and [12]. How this

will generalize to a de Sitter background geometry is, as far as we are aware, a wide open question. On

the other hand, that we have been able to successfully utilize Nariai’s ansatz [13] to solve Einstein’s

equations linearized on dSd≥4 suggests it may be worthwhile to try solving them for a background

spatially ﬂat FLRW geometry with a more general equation-of-state w. These results could not only

provide further insight into potential GW memory eﬀects, they could lead to new perspectives on the

study of large scale structure in our universe. Finally, even though [5] has obtained the d-dimensional

minimally coupled massless scalar de Sitter Green’s function from its (d + 1)-dimensional Minkowski
counterpart, the question of how to do so for the full graviton Green’s function – the collection of Gs
in equations (26), (32), and (37) – is still unanswered.

Appendix A: Geodesic spatial distance between a pair of test masses

The main goal of this section is the derivation of eq.

(5). We wish to calculate the geodesic
spatial distance between two test masses, at a ﬁxed time η, when one is located (in space) at (cid:126)X
and the other at (cid:126)X(cid:48).
(These test masses are not assumed to follow geodesics.) We note that, if
the spacetime geometry is described by eq. (4), the induced metric on a constant−η hypersurface is

18

d(cid:126)(cid:96)2 ≡ −a[η]2(δij − χij[η, (cid:126)x])dxidxj. The square of the geodesic spatial distance between (cid:126)X and (cid:126)X(cid:48) is
given by the integral

eq. (A2) has to deviate from a straight line in Euclidean space by terms of O[χij] and higher. Because
eq. (A1) with χij set to zero is also the variational principle that leads to the geodesic equation in

Euclidean space, that means if we evaluate eq. (A1) by replacing all the Y i with X i
error incurred begins at order O[(χij)2]. Doing so leads us to

Green’s function equation:

with xµ ≡ (η, (cid:126)x), x(cid:48)µ ≡ (η(cid:48), (cid:126)x(cid:48)), and |(cid:126)x − (cid:126)x(cid:48)| is the Euclidean distance between (cid:126)x and (cid:126)x(cid:48). We will obtain
explicit solutions for the case where

U [η] ≡ − p
η2 ,

p ∈ R,

(B4)

but we will begin with the general U [η]. For the de Sitter analysis at hand, equations (25), (31) and
(36) tell us the relevant p are (d − 6)(d − 4)/4, (d − 4)(d − 2)/4, and d(d − 2)/4.

Because the potential U is time dependent but space independent, we expect the Green’s function

to reﬂect the space-translation-invariance of the diﬀerential operator. In particular, as long as space is

assumed to be inﬁnite, we may employ the integral relationship between the Green’s functions in d and

d + 2 dimensions:

(B5)
where (cid:126)x⊥ = (xd, xd+1) are the two extra spatial dimensions. That the d−dimensional version of eq.
(B2) is satisﬁed by eq. (B5) – provided the (d + 2)−version holds – can be veriﬁed by applying (cid:3)d + U
(with respect to either the d-dimensional unprimed or primed variables) on both sides, where (cid:3)d ≡ ∂µ∂µ
. If (cid:126)∇2⊥ = (∂/∂xd)2 + (∂/∂xd+1)2 (or (cid:126)∇2⊥ = (∂/∂x(cid:48)d)2 + (∂/∂x(cid:48)d+1)2) is the Laplacian
or (cid:3)d ≡ ∂µ(cid:48)∂µ(cid:48)
(cid:20)
with respect to (cid:126)x⊥, we may then utilize (cid:3)d+2 = (cid:3)d − (cid:126)∇2⊥, and deduce

Using the (d + 2)-dimensional version of eq. (B2) on the right hand side yields 2δ[η − η(cid:48)]δ(d−1)[(cid:126)x − (cid:126)x(cid:48)]
as desired, provided the second line is zero. The latter is true because the integrand is a total spatial

derivative with respect to (cid:126)x⊥, and thus can be converted into a surface integral lying well outside the
light cone of xµ

d+2 ≡ (η, (cid:126)x,(cid:126)0⊥). By causality, the symmetric Green’s function (cid:98)Gd+2 has to vanish there.

Alternatively, eq. (B5) can also be proven by going to Fourier space.

R2 + (cid:126)x2⊥, eq. (B5) now becomes

and by diﬀerentiating both sides with respect to R, we obtain the following recursion relation between

the symmetric Green’s function in d and d + 2 dimensions:

We see that once the d = 2, 3 results are known, the higher dimensional ones follow from diﬀerentiation.

1. Even Dimensions

In two dimensions we ﬁrst postulate the following ansatz for the symmetric Green’s function:

scalar 2D Green’s function,

(B15)

where σs = +1 if ∂2 was carried out with respect to xµ and σs = −1 if it were carried out with respect
to x(cid:48)µ instead. To obtain 2δ(2)[x − x(cid:48)] on the right hand side, the ﬁrst term on the right hand side tells
us we need to set J[x = x(cid:48)] = 1 at the apex of the light cone ¯σ = 0. Moreover the second line on the
right hand side must vanish. For the δ[¯σ] term of eq. (B15) to be zero, (x − x(cid:48))α∂αJ[¯σ = 0] = 0, i.e., J
is constant on the light cone and thus

J[¯σ = 0] = 1

(B16)

everywhere on the light cone. For the Θ[¯σ] term of eq. (B15) to be zero, the tail function J needs to
satisfy the homogeneous wave equation with respect to both xµ and x(cid:48)µ,

(cid:0)∂2 + U(cid:1) J[η, η(cid:48); ¯σ] = 0.

(B17)
As an example, let us solve the ﬂat spacetime symmetric Green’s function G2 of the

Example

massive scalar, i.e.,

(∂2 + m2)G2[x − x(cid:48)] = 2δ(2)[x − x(cid:48)].

(B18)

Because of the highly symmetric nature of the problem at hand, we will assume that J depends on
√
spacetime solely through z ≡ m

2¯σ. Then eq. (B17) translates to

(∂2 + m2)J = m2

+ J[z]

= 0,

(B19)

whose solutions are a linear combination of the Bessel functions J0[z] and Y0[z]. To satisfy the light
cone boundary condition in eq. (B16), we must discard Y0[z] because it is singular as ¯σ → 0,

Tails and light cone B.C.’s

The tail of the Green’s function is the term proportional to Θ[¯σ],

describing the ﬁeld propagating within the null cone, i.e., ¯σ > 0. By applying the diﬀerential recursion

relation in eq. (B10) to the ansatz in eq. (B13), we see the Green’s function tail in even dimensions is

the term where all the ¯σ-derivatives are acting on J, namely

functions, namely ∂¯σJ[¯σ = 0] and ∂2
x± ≡ x0 ± x1 = η ± x1, so that

¯σJ[¯σ = 0]. The strategy is to exploit in 2D the light cone coordinates

The homogeneous wave equation obeyed by J in (B17) becomes

∂+∂−J = − 1

U J.

(B22)

(B23)

We employ a coordinate system such that (x+, x−) = (x(cid:48)+, x(cid:48)−) deﬁnes the origin, and the light cone
¯σ = (1/2)(x+ − x(cid:48)+)(x− − x(cid:48)−) = 0 consist of the positive-slope 45 degree line x− = x(cid:48)− and the
negative-slope 45 degree line x+ = x(cid:48)+. Because of the expected invariance of J under parity, (cid:126)x → −(cid:126)x
and (cid:126)x(cid:48) → −(cid:126)x(cid:48), in what follows we may focus on the x− = x(cid:48)− line (which is equivalent to η−η(cid:48) = x1−x(cid:48)1).
Denote a prime as a derivative with respect to ¯σ and over dot one with respect to η. We will see how

the ∂¯σJ[¯σ = 0] and ∂2

¯σJ[¯σ = 0] can be solved once all the ﬁrst and second derivatives with respect to

the light cone coordinates are known.

The ﬁrst observation is that, since eq. (B16) tells us J[x− = x(cid:48)−] = 1 for all x+ and J[x+ = x(cid:48)+] = 1

for all x− we must have

∂n≥1
+ J[x− = x(cid:48)−] = 0,

∂n≥1− J[x+ = x(cid:48)+] = 0.

(B24)

This also means these derivatives are simultaneously zero at the origin, the apex of the light cone.

∂n≥1
+ J[x = x(cid:48)] = ∂n≥1− J[x = x(cid:48)] = 0.

Central to our strategy is the wave equation (B23) evaluated on the light cone using eq. (B16),

The general solution involves a linear combination of the Legendre functions Pν[1 + s] and Qν[1 + s],

where the ν depends on p. Because the light cone boundary condition in eq. (B16) now corresponds
to J[s = 0] = 1, and because Qν[1 + s] blows up as s → 0 while Pν[1 + s] → 1 in the same limit, the
relevant solutions for the de Sitter analysis at hand are Legendre polynomials:

2. Odd Dimensions

In three dimensions we ﬁrst postulate the following ansatz for the symmetric Green’s function:

(cid:98)G3[η, η(cid:48); ¯σ] ≡ Θ[¯σ]J[x, x(cid:48)] ≡ Θ[¯σ]

(B44)

(B45)

Because the symmetric minimally coupled massless scalar 3D Green’s function obeys

and

∂2

whenever

¯σ > 0;

(B46)

plugging eq. (B44) into the wave equation (B2) yields

(∂2 + U )(cid:98)G3 = 2δ(3)[x − x(cid:48)]g3[x = x(cid:48)] + 2σsδ[¯σ]

(B47)

where again σs = +1 if ∂2 was carried out with respect to xµ and σs = −1 if it were carried out with
respect to x(cid:48)µ instead. We require the right hand side to return 2δ[η − η(cid:48)]δ(2)[(cid:126)x− (cid:126)x(cid:48)]. For the coeﬃcient

25

of the δ-function to be 2, we need g3[x = x(cid:48)] = 1, on the apex of the light cone. For the δ[¯σ] term to
vanish we have

(cid:18) (x − x(cid:48))α∂αg3

(cid:19)

¯σ

[¯σ = 0] = 0,

(B48)

i.e., g3 is constant on the light cone ¯σ = 0. This in turn means g3 is unity on the entire light cone:

Moreover, demanding the vanishing of the Θ[¯σ] term in eq. (B47) informs us J obeys the homogeneous

wave equation:

(∂2 + U )J = 0.

(B50)

Example

As an example, let us solve the ﬂat spacetime symmetric Green’s function G3 of the

massive scalar, i.e.,

(∂2 + m2)G3[x − x(cid:48)] = 2δ(3)[x − x(cid:48)].

(B51)

Because of the highly symmetric nature of the problem at hand, we will assume that J depends on
√
spacetime solely through z ≡ m

2¯σ. Then eq. (B50) translates to

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(∂2 + m2)J = m2

J(cid:48)[z] + J[z]

(B52)

whose solutions are a linear combination of sin[z]/z and cos[z]/z. To simultaneously require the vanish-

ing of the light cone derivative of g3 in eq. (B48) and the light cone boundary condition in eq. (B49),

we must ignore the sin[z]/z term and arrive at

Tails

The tail of the Green’s function is the term proportional to Θ[¯σ], describing the ﬁeld prop-

agating within the null cone, i.e., ¯σ > 0. By applying the diﬀerential recursion relation in eq. (B11) to

the ansatz in eq. (B44), we see the Green’s function tail in odd dimensions is the term where all the

¯σ-derivatives are acting on J, namely

Power law potential

We now derive explicit solutions to the wave equation (B50) in the case

where the potential is the power law in eq. (B4). To this end we postulate the following Nariai-inspired

ansatz [13]

ν−1/2 are associated Legendre functions, and ν depends on p. It turns out, to

where the P 1/2
ensure the light cone derivative of g3 goes to zero fast enough (eq. (B48)), the Q1/2
term needs to be discarded. For the de Sitter analysis at hand, where p ∈ {(d− 6)(d− 4)/4, (d− 4)(d−
2)/4, d(d − 2)/4}, we invoke eq. 8.754.1 of [14] to convert P 1/2

3. Application to de Sitter

With the symmetric Green’s function (cid:98)G of (∂2 − p/η2) at hand, the retarded solution to equations

ψ[η, (cid:126)x] = −16πGN

For the de Sitter analysis, we have shown in the previous section that (cid:98)G depends on ¯σ solely through

Rd−1

a[η]

the object s ≡ ¯σ/(ηη(cid:48)); moreover, since ηη(cid:48) > 0, we may assert Θ[¯σ] = Θ[s]. These allow us to apply

(B10) for even d ≥ 4 to eq.

(B13), expressing all the ¯σ-derivatives in terms of

Similarly, we may employ eq. (B11) for odd d ≥ 5 to equations (B44) and (B55),

Appendix C: Gauge invariant variables for perturbed spatially ﬂat FLRW in various dimensions

The primary goal of this section is to identify the gauge-invariant metric variables of a perturbed d

dimensional spatially ﬂat FLRW universe, generalizing Bardeen’s in 4D. We ﬁrst begin with the result

that, under

xα → xα + ξα,

an arbitrary metric would transform as

gµν → gµν + ξσ∂σgµν + ∂{µξσgν}σ.

That means under x → x + ξ, the perturbation of a conformally ﬂat metric, namely the χµν in

would transform as

gµν[η, (cid:126)x] ≡ a[η]2 (ηµν + χµν[η, (cid:126)x])

χµν → χµν + ∂{µξν} + 2

where the indices on ξν are moved with ηαβ. By exploiting the spatial rotational SOd−1 symmetry

of the background geometry, we shall perform an irreducible scalar-vector-tensor decomposition of the

metric perturbation as well as an analogous one for ξ. That is, we do

ξµ = (ξ0, ∂i(cid:96) + (cid:96)i),

δij∂i(cid:96)j = 0.

and

χ00 ≡ E,

Remarks

In 2D the Einstein tensor is identically zero, and Einstein’s eq. (8) no longer deﬁnes

dynamics for the metric. In 3D, the gauge-invariant tensor mode Dij does not exist. For, in momentum
(cid:126)k-space, if we choose a coordinate system such that ki = |(cid:126)k|δi

29

would mean 0 = kiDij[(cid:126)k] = |(cid:126)k|Dj2 = |(cid:126)k|D2j and the traceless condition would imply D11 = 0; i.e.,
Dij = 0. This is why, in this paper, we are restricting our attention to d ≥ 4.
