TRACE IDENTITIES FOR THE TOPOLOGICAL VERTEX

JIM BRYAN, MARTIJN KOOL, BENJAMIN YOUNG

ABSTRACT. The topological vertex is a universal series which can be
regarded as an object in combinatorics, representation theory, geometry,
or physics. It encodes the combinatorics of 3D partitions, the action of
vertex operators on Fock space, the Donaldson-Thomas theory of toric
Calabi-Yau threefolds, or the open string partition function of C3.

We prove several identities in which a sum over terms involving the
topological vertex is expressed as a closed formula, often a product of
simple terms, closely related to Fourier expansions of Jacobi forms. We
use purely combinatorial and representation theoretic methods to prove
our formulas, but we discuss applications to the Donaldson-Thomas in-
variants of elliptically ﬁbered Calabi-Yau threefolds at the end of the
paper.

1. INTRODUCTION

The topological vertex Vλµν = Vλµν(p) is a universal formal Laurent se-
ries in p depending on a triple of partitions (λ, µ, ν). It can be considered
as an object in combinatorics, representation theory, geometry, or physics.
In combinatorics, Vλµν is the generating function for the number of 3D
partitions with asymptotic legs of type (λ, µ, ν) (see Deﬁnition 2). In repre-
sentation theory, Vλµν is given as the matrix coefﬁcients of a certain vertex
operator on Fock space [14]. In geometry, Vλµν is the basic building block
for computing the Donaldson-Thomas/Gromov-Witten invariants of toric
Calabi-Yau threefolds [11]. The topological vertex was ﬁrst discovered in
physics as an open string partition function in type IIA string theory on C3
[1]. An explicit expression for Vλµν in terms of Schur functions was given
by [14] (see § 3).

In this paper we prove several “trace identities” in which a sum over
certain combinations of the vertex is expressed as a closed formula, often
a product of simple terms. The products are closely related to the Fourier
expansions of Jacobi forms. Applications of these identities are used to
compute the Donaldson-Thomas partition functions of certain Calabi-Yau
threefolds in terms of Jacobi forms [5, 6, 7].

tions of vertex operators (see § 5. We thank Georg Oberdieck for providing
feedback on an early draft of this paper.

2. DEFINITIONS AND THE MAIN RESULT.

In this section we give the combinatorial deﬁnition of the vertex and we

state our main identities.

Deﬁnition 1. Let (λ, µ, ν) be a triple of ordinary partitions. A 3D partition
π asymptotic to (λ, µ, ν) is a subset

π ⊂ (Z≥0)3

satisfying

(1) if any of (i + 1, j, k), (i, j + 1, k), and (i, j, k + 1) is in π, then

(2)

(i, j, k) is also in π, and
(a) (j, k) ∈ λ if and only if (i, j, k) ∈ π for all i ≫ 0,
(b) (k, i) ∈ µ if and only if (i, j, k) ∈ π for all j ≫ 0,
(c) (i, j) ∈ ν if and only if (i, j, k) ∈ π for all k ≫ 0.

where we regard ordinary partitions as ﬁnite subsets of (Z≥0)2 via their
diagram.

Intuitively, π is a pile of boxes in the positive octant of 3-space. Condition
(1) means that the boxes are stacked stably with gravity pulling them in the
(−1, −1, −1) direction; condition (2) means that the pile of boxes is inﬁnite
along the coordinate axes with cross-sections asymptotically given by λ, µ,
and ν.

The subset {(i, j, k) : (j, k) ∈ λ} ⊂ π will be called the leg of π in the i
direction, and the legs in the j and k directions are deﬁned analogously. Let

ξπ(i, j, k) = 1 − # of legs of π containing (i, j, k).

We deﬁne the renormalized volume of π by

|π| = X(i,j,k)∈π

ξπ(i, j, k).

Note that |π| can be negative.

Deﬁnition 2. The topological vertex Vλµν is deﬁned to be

Vλµν =Xπ

p|π|

TRACE IDENTITIES FOR THE TOPOLOGICAL VERTEX

3

where the sum is taken over all 3D partitions π asymptotic to (λ, µ, ν).
We regard Vλµν as a formal Laurent series in p. Note that Vλµν is clearly
cyclically symmetric in the indices, and reﬂection about the i = j plane
yields

Vλµν = Vµ′λ′ν ′

where ′ denotes conjugate partition:

λ′ = {(i, j) : (j, i) ∈ λ}.

This deﬁnition of topological vertex differs from the vertex C(λ, µ, ν)
of the physics literature by a normalization factor (and we use the vari-
able p instead of q). Our Vλµν is equal to P (λ, µ, ν) deﬁned by Okounkov,
Reshetikhin, and Vafa [14, eqn 3.16]. They derive an explicit formula for
Vλµν = P (λ, µ, ν) in terms of Schur functions [14, eqns 3.20 and 3.21].

The rows or parts of λ are the integers λj = min{i | (i, j) 6∈ λ}, for

j ≥ 0. We use the notation

|λ| =Xj

λj,

kλk2 =Xj

λ2
j .

Let (cid:3) denote the partition with a single part of size 1.

We also use the notation

M(p, q) =

∞Ym=1

(1 − pmq)−m

and the shorthand M(p) = M(p, 1). Here M stands for MacMahon, who
proved [10] that

V∅∅∅ = M(p).

We can now state our main result.

The sums in the left hand sides of the above formulas run over all partitions.

We prove Formula (1) in section 3 using the orthogonality properties of
skew Schur functions. Formulas (2) and (3) are proved in section 4 using
a theorem of Bloch-Okounkov [3]. The most difﬁcult identity to prove is
equation (4) which we do in section 5. There we prove that the left hand
side of equation (4) is given as the trace of a certain product of operators on
Fock space (hence the term “trace identities” in the title). To compute the
trace, we use a trick which involves an “inﬁnite number” of permutations
of the operators.

3. THE TOPOLOGICAL VERTEX AND SCHUR FUNCTIONS

Okounkov-Reshetikhin-Vafa derived a formula for the topological vertex
in terms of skew Schur functions. Translating their formulas [14, 3.20&
3.21] into our notation, we get:
(5)
Vλµν(p) = M(p)p− 1

sλ′/η(p−ν−ρ)sµ/η(p−ν ′−ρ).

tions (2) and (3).

Θ(p) = −Θ(p−1).

be −ν ′ − ρ.

only need the cases of n = 1 and n = 2.

Using this theorem, we will prove equations (2) and (3) of the main the-

orem.

5. VERTEX OPERATORS AND THE PROOF OF EQUATION (4)

There are several sources for vertex operators and the inﬁnite wedge for-
malism. For consistency, we will follow the notation and conventions of
[13, Appendix A].

Let V be the vector space with basis {k} , k ∈ Z + 1

Let Λ

The matrix coefﬁcients of the vertex operators in the {vλ} basis are given

(Γ−(x)vµ, vλ) = (vµ, Γ+(x)vλ) = sλ/µ(x).

2In [13], the argument of Γ± is s, and the dependence on the underlying set of variables

x is left implicit. We prefer to make x the explicit argument.

10

JIM BRYAN, MARTIJN KOOL, BENJAMIN YOUNG

Orthogonality of the skew Schur functions then gives rise to the following

commutation equation:

Γ+(x)Γ−(y) =Yi,j

(1 − xiyj)−1Γ−(y)Γ+(x),

Γ+(up−ρ)Γ−(vp−ρ) = M(p, uv)Γ−(vp−ρ)Γ+(up−ρ)

While the operator E0(p) does not have good commutation relations with
the vertex operators, the operator E(a, p) does. Hence we ﬁrst replace E0(p)
with the more general E(a, p), compute the trace, and then specialize to the
a0 coefﬁcient.

Proof. Our strategy is the following. We use the cyclic invariance of trace
along with the commutation relations for Γ+ to move the operator Γ+ past
the other operators cyclically to the right until the operators are back to
their original positions, but with new arguments. We perform this operation
a countable number of times, eventually making the Γ+ operator disappear4.
We then employ the same strategy moving Γ− cyclically to the left a count-
able number of times until it disappears and we are left with a term which
we can evaluate with the Bloch-Okounkov theorem (Theorem 5).

We ﬁrst cyclically commute the operator Γ+ to the right using equa-

tions (8), (11), and (12):

= M(p) tr(E(a, p)Γ−(p−ρ)Γ+(p−ρ)qH)
= M(p) tr(E(a, p)Γ−(p−ρ)qHΓ+(qp−ρ))
= M(p) tr(Γ+(qp−ρ)E(a, p)Γ−(p−ρ)qH)
= M(p)(1 − qa−1) tr(E(a, p)Γ+(qp−ρ)Γ−(p−ρ)qH).

Cyclically commuting Γ+ to the right a second time we get:

tr(E(a, p)Γ+(p−ρ)Γ−(p−ρ)qH) =
M(p)(1 − qa−1)M(p, q)(1 − q2a−1) tr(E(a, p)Γ+(q2p−ρ)Γ−(p−ρ)qH).
After performing N iterations of this strategy, we arrive at

tr(E(a, p)Γ+(p−ρ)Γ−(p−ρ)qH) =

M(p, qd−1)(1 − qda−1) tr(E(a, p)Γ+(qN p−ρ)Γ−(p−ρ)qH).

It follows from equation (7) that

Γ±(qN p−ρ) ≡ Id mod qN .

So the above two equations imply that the equation

tr(E(a, p)Γ+(p−ρ)Γ−(p−ρ)qH) =

M(p, qd−1)(1 − qda−1) tr(E(a, p)Γ−(p−ρ)qH)

∞Yd=1

holds to all orders in q and is hence true as a formal power series in q.

We now apply the same strategy commuting Γ− to the left:

tr(E(a, p)Γ−(p−ρ)qH) = (1 − a) tr(E(a, p)Γ−(qp−ρ)qH)

= (1 − a)(1 − aq) tr(E(a, p)Γ−(q2p−ρ)qH)
= . . .

=

(1 − aqd−1) tr(E(a, p)qH)

∞Yd=1

and so we have proved

tr(E(a, p)Γ+(p−ρ)Γ−(p−ρ)qH) =

M(p, qd−1)(1 − qda−1)(1 − aqd−1) tr(E(a, p)qH).

From the deﬁnition of Er(p) we see that its matrix entries are all off-

6. GEOMETRY AND APPLICATIONS

6.1. Overview. In this section we brieﬂy outline the applications of our
trace formulas to the Donaldson-Thomas theory of elliptically ﬁbered Calabi-
Yau threefolds [5, 6, 7] and the connection with Jacobi forms. This section
is logically independent from the previous sections and can be safely ig-
nored by readers not interested in the geometric applications of our theo-
rem.

As we will explain below, each formula in our main theorem gives a cer-
tain contribution to the Donaldson-Thomas partition function of elliptically
ﬁbered threefolds. Namely, we have the following.

• The contribution of multiples of a nodal elliptic ﬁber is given by

equation (1).

• The contribution of multiples of a smooth elliptic ﬁber attached to a

smooth section curve is given by equation (2).

• The contribution of multiples of a smooth elliptic ﬁber attached to a

nodal section curve is given by equation (3).

• The contribution of multiples of a nodal elliptic ﬁber attached to a

smooth section curve is given by equation (4).

6.2. A very short description of Donaldson-Thomas theory. Donaldson-
Thomas theory is a curve counting theory for Calabi-Yau threefolds which
is conjecturally equivalent to Gromov-Witten theory [11]. Let X be a
Calabi-Yau threefold, let β ∈ H2(X, Z) be a curve class, and let n ∈ Z.

Let

Hilbβ,n(X) = {Z ⊂ X,

[Z] = β, χ(OZ) = n}

TRACE IDENTITIES FOR THE TOPOLOGICAL VERTEX

15

be the Hilbert scheme parameterizing subschemes of class β and whose
structure sheaf has holomorphic Euler characteristic n. The Donaldson-
Thomas invariant DTβ,n(X) is deﬁned to be the Behrend function weighted
Euler characteristic of the Hilbert scheme:

where e(−) is topological Euler characteristic and

DTβ,n(X) =Xk∈Z

k e(cid:0)ν−1(k)(cid:1)

ν : Hilbβ,n(X) → Z

is Behrend’s constructible function [2]. The unweighted Euler characteris-
tics are also often considered:

cDTβ,n(X) = e(cid:0)Hilbβ,n(X)(cid:1) .

In this discussion of our applications we will only consider the unweighted

invariants cDTβ,n(X). For further discourse on including the Behrend func-

The invariants are usually assembled into a generating function called the

partition function:

cDT(X) =Xn,β cDTβ,n(X)qβpn.

The above series can be considered as an element in the Novikov ring of X
with coefﬁcients which are formal Laurent series in p.5

6.3. Donaldson-Thomas invariants of a threefold with a torus action.
The topological Euler characteristic of a C-scheme S with the action of a
complex torus T ∼= (C∗)k is given by the Euler characteristic of the ﬁxed
locus:

e(S) = e(cid:0)ST(cid:1) .

Thus if X is a Calabi-Yau threefold equipped with the action of a torus T ,
then

cDTβ,n(X) = e(cid:0)Hilbβ,n(X)T(cid:1) .

In the case where X is toric with the action of a torus T , then Hilbβ,n(X)T

parameterizes T -invariant subschemes and is a ﬁnite set. Thus cDTβ,n(X)

simply counts the number of T -invariant subschemes Z ⊂ X with [Z] = β
and χ(OZ) = n.

5With an appropriate choice of a basis of H2(X, Z), the partition function can be con-
sidered as a formal power series in a set a variables qi whose coefﬁcients are Laurent series
in p.

On a T -invariant coordinate chart C3 ⊂ X, a T -invariant subscheme is
given by a monomial ideal I ⊂ C[x, y, z]. There is a bijection between 3D
partitions and monomial ideals π ↔ I given by:

(i, j, k) ∈ π ⇐⇒ xiyjzk 6∈ I.

If the partition π is asymptotic to (λ, µ, ν) as in Deﬁnition 1, then the sub-
scheme deﬁned by the corresponding monomial ideal I is supported on the
coordinate axes of C3 and has nilpotent thickenings along the axes deter-
mined by (λ, µ, ν).

So we see that in order to computecDTβ,n(X) for a toric Calabi-Yau three-

fold X, one needs to count 3D partitions (one for each coordinate chart)
such that the corresponding subschemes agree on the coordinate overlaps
and the curve class and holomorphic Euler characteristic are given by β
and n respectively. This leads to a general formalism developed in [11] for

computing cDT(X) in terms of the topological vertex.

6.4. Using the topological vertex in non-toric geometries. Even if X has
no torus action, under some favorable circumstances, we can still use the
topological vertex technology to compute Donaldson-Thomas invariants.
The idea is to exploit the motivic nature of Euler characteristic. The Eu-
ler characteristic is a ring homomorphism from the Grothendieck group of
varieties over C to the integers. More prosaically, this means that one can
compute the Euler characteristic of a scheme by stratifying it and then sum-
ming the Euler characteristics of each individual stratum.

For example, one can stratify the Hilbert scheme by specifying the sup-
port of the corresponding subschemes. Let C ⊂ X be a (not necessarily
irreducible) curve, and let

Hilbβ,n(X, C) ⊂ Hilbβ,n(X)

be the locus parameterizing subschemes Z such that the reduced support
of Z is contained in C. We can then deﬁne the contribution of C to the
Donaldson-Thomas invariants as

cDT(X, C) =Xn,β

e(Hilbβ,n(X, C))pnqβ.

neighborhood of C in X. So while X itself may not admit a non-trivial C∗-

A key observation is that Hilbβ,n(X, C) only depends on bXC, the formal
action, it is sometimes the case that bXC does admit an action which then

This strategy can potentially be iterated: the ﬁxed locus Hilbβ,n(X, C)C∗
may be further stratiﬁed (for example by the support of the embedded points)
and these substrata may admit further C∗-actions. The upshot is that in

induces an action on the stratum Hilbβ,n(X, C).

TRACE IDENTITIES FOR THE TOPOLOGICAL VERTEX

17

circumstances where this strategy is successful, it reduces the computa-
tion of the Euler characteristic of the Hilbert scheme to the substratum of
the Hilbert scheme parameterizing subschemes which are formally locally
monomial (FoLoMo for short), i.e. given by monomial ideals in the formal
neighborhoods of each point. Denoting this substratum by the subscript
FoLoMo , we get

cDT(X, C) =Xβ,n
=Xβ,n

e(cid:0)Hilbβ,n(X, C)(cid:1) pnqβ
e(cid:16)Hilbβ,n

F oLoM o(X, C)(cid:17) pnqβ.

Due to the bijection between monomial ideals and 3D partitions, FoLoMo
ideals in the formal neighborhood of a point can be counted with the topo-
logical vertex.

6.5. The case of elliptically ﬁbered Calabi-Yau threefolds. Let X be a
Calabi-Yau threefold admitting an elliptic ﬁbration π : X → S. We con-
sider the following curves in X. Let F ⊂ X be some non-singular ﬁber and
let N ⊂ X be a ﬁber having a nodal singularity. Let B be a smooth section
curve of genus g, that is a non-singular curve of genus g meeting F and N
once each in a node. The strategy outlined in the previous subsection works
particularly well in this setting where we consider curve classes which are
arbitrary multiples of the ﬁber class plus possibly a single multiple of the
section class. In these cases, the local contributions can be expressed in
terms of the topological vertex. The results are the following:

There is one additional case to consider. Let B′ be nodal section curve,
that is a curve that has a single nodal singularity at n ∈ B′ and we assume
that B′ meets F at the point n so that the singularity of B′ ∪ F at n is
formally locally that of the coordinate axes. Let g′ be the geometric genus
of B′. Then

cDT(X, B′ + F ) =Xn

All of the above formulas have a sum over (2D) partitions. Geometrically,
this is because a FoLoMo subscheme which is a nilpotent thickening of a
curve is determined, away from singular points and embedded points, by a
monomial ideal in the formal coordinates transverse to the curve, which is
in turn determined by a 2D partition. Thus in the above formulas, the term
in the sum corresponding to a partition λ counts subschemes which have
thickenings determined by λ along the ﬁber curve (F or N).

Each term in the sum is a combination of topological vertexes which
counts the ways in which embedded points can appear in the subscheme.

For example, in the formula for cDT(X, B + N) the Vλλ′∅ counts the ways

of adding embedded points at the node n ∈ N, the Vλ(cid:3)∅ counts ways of
adding embedded points at p = B ∩ N, the Vλ∅∅ counts the number of
ways of adding embedded points at some arbitrary point of N − {n, p}, and
the V(cid:3)∅∅ counts the number of ways of adding embedded points at some
arbitrary point of B − p.

The reason that the vertex terms in the above formulas appear with a
(possibly negative) exponent deserves explaining.
In the case of a toric
Calabi-Yau threefold, the number of possible locations for embedded points
is ﬁnite — they only occur at the origins of the torus invariant coordinate
charts. In the case of F oLoMo subschemes, embedded points can occur
at an inﬁnite number of locations. In the example at hand, the embedded
points parameterized by Vλ∅∅ can occur at any point of the curve N except
n and p and the embedded points parameterized by V(cid:3)∅∅ can occur at any
point of B except p. The possible locations are parameterized by symmet-
ric products of N − {n, p} and B − p respectively. Symmetric products are

TRACE IDENTITIES FOR THE TOPOLOGICAL VERTEX

19

very amenable to our motivic methods. Indeed, symmetric products endow
the Grothendieck group of varieties with a lambda ring structure which is
compatible with the Euler characteristic homomorphism. Because of the
symmetric product formalism in the Grothendieck group, the Vλ∅∅ and the
V(cid:3)∅∅ terms appear with exponents given by the topological Euler charac-
teristic of N − {n, p} and B − p respectively:

(Vλ∅∅)e(N −{n,p})(V(cid:3)∅∅)e(B−{p}) =

6.6. Applying our trace formulas and the appearance of Jacobi forms.
By equation (5), we see that

V(cid:3)∅∅ = M(p)(1 − p)−1.

After substituting the above into the equations of the previous section,
we may apply the formulas in our main theorem as well as the well known

The quotients on the left can be interpreted as the partition function for
connected Donaldson-Thomas invariants. There is a general conjecture due
to Huang, Katz, and Klemm [8] which predicts that the Donaldson-Thomas
partition function for an elliptically ﬁbered Calabi-Yau, in classes given by
a ﬁxed section class and multiple ﬁber classes, is given by a Jacobi form.
Several special cases of this conjecture have been proven using the methods
outlined in this section, namely when X is (1) a local elliptic surface [6],
(2) a product of a K3 surface and an elliptic curve [5], and (3) a product of
an Abelian surface and an elliptic curve [7].
