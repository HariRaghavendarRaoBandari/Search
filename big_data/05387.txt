Abstract: We consider the holographic duality where the CFT side is given by SU (N )
adjoint free scalar ﬁeld theory. Compared to the vector models, the set of single trace oper-
ators is immensely extended so that the corresponding AdS theory also contains inﬁnitely
many massive higher spin ﬁelds on top of the massless ones. We compute the one-loop
vacuum energy of these AdS ﬁelds to test this duality at the subleading order in large N
expansion. The determination of the bulk vacuum energy requires a proper scheme to sum
up the inﬁnitely many contributions. For that, we develop a new method and apply it ﬁrst
to calculate the vacuum energies for the ﬁrst few ‘Regge trajectories’ in AdS4 and AdS5 . In
considering the full vacuum energy of AdS theory dual to a matrix model CFT, we ﬁnd that
there exist more than one available prescriptions for the one-loop vacuum energy. Taking a
particular prescription, we determine the full vacuum energy of the AdS5 theory, whereas
the AdS4 calculation still remains technically prohibitive. This result shows that the full
vacuum energy of the AdS5 theory coincides with minus of the free energy of a single scalar
ﬁeld on the boundary. This is analogous to the O(N ) vector model case, hence suggests an
interpretation of the positive shift of the bulk coupling constant, i.e. from N 2 − 1 to N 2 .

Introduction

Recently, there has been signiﬁcant progress in the vectorial AdS/CFT correspondence
[1, 2]. It relates free/critical CFTs in the O(N ) (or U (N )) vector multiplet to the Vasiliev’s
higher spin theory [3, 4] with a certain boundary conditions. An important feature of this
duality is the precise one-to-one correspondence between the spectrum of ‘light’ conformal
primaries1 on the CFT side and the spectrum of quadratic ﬂuctuations near the AdS
vacuum. In fact, the match of the spectrum — shown by Flato and Fronsdal [5] — predates
the AdS/CFT conjecture and even Vasiliev’s theory. It states that the tensor product of
two singleton representations of so(2, 3) — the scalar one, Rac or the spinor one, Di — can
be decomposed into the inﬁnite sum of massless higher spin representations:

Rac ⊗ Rac =

∞

Ms=0

D(s + 1, s) ,

Di ⊗ Di = D(2, 0) ⊕

∞

Ms=1

D(s + 1, s) ,

(1.1)

where D(∆, s) is the representation with spin s and the conformal dimension ∆. This
mathematical theorem can be translated into the AdS/CFT language as: all bilinear scalar
operators (the tensor product of Rac) in free conformal scalar/spinor ﬁelds in three dimen-
sions have an one-to-one correspondence with the massless higher spin ﬁelds in the bulk of
AdS4 (the representations of D(s + 1, s)). The fact that the CFT ﬁelds are in the vectorial
representation — not in the adjoint one — singles out only bilinear operators as the single
trace operators. The contributions of higher trace operators are suppressed in the large N
limit, hence we are left with a minimal set of operators in the spectrum.

A trivial but important property of this duality is that the boundary CFTs do not have
any 1/N subleading contributions as they are free theories. An immediate implication of
this property towards the bulk physics is the absence of any quantum corrections. This is
a remarkable feature because it necessitates a precise cancellation of inﬁnitely many loop
diagrams in the bulk. This aspect has been examined in the series of the papers [6–8] and
[9–13] where the authors considered the simplest example, the vanishment of the one-loop
vacuum energy.2 Since the vacuum energy in AdSd+1 ought to be dual to the CFT zero-
point function, they can only depend on the size of the radius of the boundary Sd . The
summation of the vacuum energies over all ﬁeld contents results in an inﬁnite series:

∞

Xs=0

=

∞

Xs=0

s

Γ(1)

s (z) = Γ(1)(z) ,

(1.2)

where Γ(1)
s (z) is the UV regularized (with a regulator z) vacuum energy with the massless
spin s ﬁeld in the loop. Two diﬀerent methods have been considered to analyze this
series. In the ﬁrst method, the summation over s is carried out before getting the function
Γ(1)(z). The resulting vacuum energy is free from UV divergence and vanishes as z → 0,
for the minimal Vasiliev theory. This method does not require an additional regularization

scheme and it is used for even d cases where Γ(1)
s (z) have relatively simple forms. In odd
d, however, the expression of Γ(1)
s (z) is more involved such that we cannot identify Γ(1)(z)
with preceding method. This necessitates another approach. In the second method, we
take only the ﬁnite part Γ(1) ren
s (z) (and neglect the divergent part) to end up with
. This series is divergent so requires a new regularization in order to

show that it indeed vanishes.

Motivated by these developments, we study the quantum property of the AdS theory

dual to the free scalar CFT in SU (N ) adjoint representation [18],

SCFT[φ] =Z ddx Trhφ† (cid:3) φi ,

(1.3)

by focusing on its vacuum energy. There are several reasons which lead us to do so. Firstly,
in contrast to the vector models, the set of single trace operators includes not only bilinear
but also operators multi-linear in the ﬁeld φ. This greatly extends the ﬁeld content of
the dual theory as compared to Vasiliev’s theory. Standard AdS/CFT considerations lead
us to expect that the holographic dual of such theory is the Vasiliev higher spin theory
coupled to inﬁnitely many massive higher spin ﬁelds. The whole spectrum organizes itself
into inﬁnitely many ‘Regge trajectories’,3 each of which forms a ‘matter’ multiplet of the
higher spin algebra. Secondly, the putative holographic duality would closely mimic the
dualities involving string theory in AdS in many ways. In particular, the theory already
has interesting thermodynamics, exhibiting a Hagedorn phase transition [19, 20] much like
string theory [21]. Thirdly, as a consequence of the usual AdS/CFT dictionary, we expect
that the free CFT limit of stringy AdS/CFT dualities corresponds to taking the tensionless
limit of string theory in AdS [22–34].

Further, since we are working with a free CFT, the determination of the spectrum in
closed form is available, even if it is a complicated task. As in the Flato-Fronsdal theorem
which dictates the spectrum of the vector models, the spectrum of SU (N ) adjoint model
can be identiﬁed by decomposing the multiple tensor products of singletons into irreducible
representations:

∞

Mn=2

Rac⊗n =M∆,s

N∆,s D(∆, s) ,

(1.4)

where N∆,s is the multiplicity of the representation D(∆, s) and n is the number of con-
formal ﬁelds. While doing this decomposition, the tensor product should be properly
projected for the consistency with the cyclic invariance of trace [35–40].

We now present a brief overview of our strategy. Firstly, we determine the operator
spectra of the CFT which will be identiﬁed with the spectrum of the bulk theory. To
determine the spectrum, we mainly take the most standard way of character analysis
[41, 42] but will also present the oscillator analysis for the d = 3 case. These analyses
give us information about the operator spectrum so that we can calculate in principle the

3By Regge trajectory, we mean the set of AdS ﬁelds dual to the CFT operators made by a ﬁxed number

of conformal ﬁelds: the n-th trajectory is dual to the CFT operators involving n + 1 conformal ﬁelds.

corresponding AdS vacuum energies, knowing the one-loop contribution from each bulk
ﬁeld [43–47]. However the diﬃculties arise in the summation of the vacuum energies from
diﬀerent ﬁelds. This is due to both the increasing complexity of the spectrum as higher
and higher Regge trajectories are included, as well as the careful regularization of many
formally divergent sums, as was already encountered in the vector model case [6–8]. In
order to surpass this problem, we introduce a new technique which enables us to access the
resummed vacuum energy directly from the character bypassing the steps of decomposition
and resummation. This is realized in terms of a functional F whose input is the character
χ (or generalized partition function4) of the CFT and the output is the UV regularized
AdS vacuum energy:

N∆,s

X∆,s

∆,s

= F[χ](z) .

(1.5)

In this paper, we revisit the Vasiliev’s theories as test examples of applying the new method.
Then, we challenge the AdS theory dual to the SU (N ) adjoint matrix model.

Organization of the paper

The paper is organized as follows. We begin with a review of unitary irreducible repre-
sentations (UIRs) of the d–dimensional conformal algebra so(2, d) in Section 2, including
the introduction of singleton representations Di and Rac, construction of (reducible) rep-
resentations by taking tensor products of singletons, as well as character formulae for the
various UIRs. Based on the character of conformal algebra, we present decomposition rules
of singleton tensor products, by using a generating function method. We also discuss an os-
cillator construction for arriving at these decomposition rules. Section 3 contains a review
of the heat kernel and zeta function formalism for computing one-loop eﬀects in Euclidean
Anti-de Sitter space, and general expectations from AdS/CFT duality for matching with
free CFT answers. In Section 4, we compute the spectral zeta function for AdS4 using
the results for the spectrum found in Section 2, and also by the new formalism alluded
to above. Section 5 contains the extension of the above results to AdS5 where we also
discuss how mixed symmetry ﬁelds may be taken into account. Section 6 summarizes and
concludes this paper and discusses related issues. Appendices contain various additional
details.

2 Operator Spectrum of Free SU(N) adjoint Model

In this section, we will study the operator spectrum of free matrix models. Many works
have been devoted to this task [35–42]. Putting aside other interesting models, we only
consider the simplest case of free scalar SU (N ) adjoint model. According to the standard
scheme of AdS/CFT correspondence, in the large N limit, single trace operators are dual
4By this we mean ‘reﬁned’ partition function Tr(cid:16)e−βH+Pi αi J i(cid:17) computed over the the one-particle

Hilbert space of the theory. Here β is the temperature and αi are chemical potentials for the Cartan
subalgebra of so(d) ⊂ so(2, d).

to the single-particle states (or ﬁelds) in the bulk theory. Any single trace operator in a
scalar CFT can be written as a linear combination of the operators,

(2.1)

Trh(cid:0)∂µ1∂µ2 ··· ∂µl φ(cid:1)(cid:0)∂ν1∂ν2 ··· ∂νmφ(cid:1)···(cid:0)∂ρ1∂ρ2 ··· ∂ρn φ(cid:1)i .

These operators are in general reducible with respect to the conformal symmetry, and
can be decomposed into unitary irreducible representations (UIR). Since the d-dimensional
conformal symmetry and the isometry of AdSd+1 are equivalent — they are both so(2, d)
— the single trace operators carrying UIRs of the conformal symmetry are in one-to-one
correspondence with the bulk ﬁelds carrying UIRs of the AdS isometry. The decomposition
does not mix the operators (2.1) with diﬀerent number of scalar ﬁelds in the trace, hence
can be performed for a given number of scalar ﬁelds.

The identiﬁcation of all single trace operators reduces to the decomposition of the
operators (2.1) into UIRs for any number of scalar ﬁelds in the large N limit. Exact
expressions of the decompositions — that is, the expression of UIR single trace operators
in terms of φ — involve rather complicated (anti)symmetrizations and contractions of
indices. However, for our purposes, it is suﬃcient to ﬁnd out the UIR labels of the resulting
operators from the decompositions. The latter task can be conveniently carried out relying
on the representation theory of conformal symmetry so(2, d) . The free scalar ﬁeld carries
a short UIR, called scalar singleton, hence we are to analyze the decomposition of multiple
tensor products of singletons into UIRs of so(2, d) . The Lie algebra character is one of the
most convenient tools for this analysis. In the following, we begin with a brief summary
of the UIRs and the characters of so(2, d) . More detailed accounts and derivations can be
found in [48].5

2.1 Review: UIRs and Characters of so(2, d)

The conformal algebra in d-dimension is isomorphic to so(2, d). The latter is generated by
MAB, whose commutation relations are given by

[ MAB , MCD ] = i(cid:0)ηA[C MB]D − ηB[C MA]D(cid:1) ,

(2.2)

where the indices A, B, . . . run over +,−, 1, 2, . . . , d while a, b, . . . = 1, 2, . . . , d . The non-
vanishing components of the metric are η±∓ = 1 and ηab = δab . Its lowest weight (LW)
representations V(∆, ℓ) are labeled by those of the so(2) ⊕ so(d) maximally compact sub-
algebra generated by E = M+− and Mab . The ∆ corresponds to the eigenvalue of the
generator E, and the ℓ = (ℓ1, . . . , ℓh) labels the irreducible representation of so(d) with

ℓ1 ≥ ··· ≥ ℓh−1 ≥ |ℓh| ;

h = [ d

2 ] ;

ℓh ≥ 0 if

d = 2h + 1 ,

(2.3)

where ℓi’s are either all integers, or all half-integers for a given representation.

The character of V(∆, ℓ) is given by

5A particularly accessible ‘physicist’s account’ for the UIRs of so(2, d) is available in [49]. The UIRs of
so(2, 3) and so(2, 4) were ﬁrst constructed in [50] and [51] respectively. For the symmetries of the singleton
representation, see [52, 53].

The irreducible representation D(∆, ℓ) of so(2, d) is the quotient of V(∆, ℓ) by its
maximal so(2, d)-invariant subspace D(∆′, ℓ′) with a certain ∆′ and ℓ′ . The corresponding
character of D(∆, ℓ) is then given by

χD(∆,ℓ)(q, x) = χ∆,ℓ(q, x) − χD(∆′,ℓ′)(q, x) .

(2.9)

In the following, we summarize the UIRs D(∆, ℓ) of so(2, d) and their characters χD(∆,ℓ) .
For that, we need to deﬁne the number p as

for a so(d) representation ℓ = (ℓ1, . . . , ℓh).

ℓ1 = ℓ2 = ··· = |ℓp| > ℓp+1 ,

Long representations
We consider ﬁrst the representations D(∆, ℓ) whose so(d) part, ℓ, satisﬁes

1 ≤ p <

d

,

ℓ1 ≥ d − 2h ,

(2.10)

(2.11)

which excludes the scalar ℓ = (0, . . . , 0) and the spinor ℓ = ( 1
2 ) representations in
odd dimensions and all the representations with p = h in even d . For the above class of
representations, the unitarity bound is given by

2 , . . . ,± 1

Above the bound, the LW representation does not develop any invariant subspace, hence

∆ℓ = ℓ1 + d − p − 1 .

(2.12)

D(∆, ℓ) = V(∆, ℓ)

[ ∆ > ∆ℓ ] .

(2.13)

These are long representations. Below the bound, ∆ < ∆ℓ , the representation becomes
non-unitary.

– 5 –

Semi-short representations

If ∆ saturates the unitarity bound, i.e. ∆ = ∆ℓ , the representation get shortened as

where ¯ℓ = (¯ℓ1, . . . , ¯ℓh) is deﬁned through ℓ as

D(∆ℓ, ℓ) = V(∆ℓ, ℓ)(cid:14) D(cid:0)∆ℓ + 1, ¯ℓ(cid:1) ,

¯ℓi = ℓi − δpi .

(2.14)

(2.15)

These representations are often referred as to semi-short for the distinction from shorter
representations, namely singletons, which will be referred as to short. Notice that for p > 1 ,
we have ∆ℓ + 1 = ∆ ¯ℓ , hence the invariant subspace corresponds again to a semi-short
representation D(∆ ¯ℓ, ¯ℓ) . Therefore, the quotient process should be repeated recursively
until one reaches p = 1 .6 The characters of semi-short representations are given by

χD(∆ℓ,ℓ)(q, x) = χ∆ℓ,ℓ(q, x) − χD(∆ℓ+1, ¯ℓ)(q, x) ,

(2.16)

which again can be recursively decomposed into χ∆ℓ,ℓ with diﬀerent ℓ’s. Both the semi-
short and long representations have the Gelfand-Kirillov (GK) dimension d [54]: they can
be described by a function of d continuous variables. Hence they can be realized either as
an operator on d-dimensional boundary without an on-shell condition or as a ﬁeld living
on AdSd+1 . More precisely, in the bosonic case, D(∆, ℓ) can be realized as a boundary
irreducible so(d)-tensor operator,7

or as a bulk irreducible so(1, d)-tensor ﬁeld,

where R is the radius of AdS. At the shortening point ∆ = ∆ℓ , the boundary operator
satisﬁes a conservation condition:

whereas the bulk ﬁeld admits a gauge symmetry

εµ1(¯ℓ1),...,µh(¯ℓh)(z, x)i .

(2.20)

(2.21)

Here Yℓ is the projection operator to the irreducible Young diagram ℓ (see [55–57] for
the details). Notice that the conservation condition corresponds to the invariant subspace
D(∆ ¯ℓ, ¯ℓ) .

6This has been shown explicitly by means of an oscillator construction in [41] for the case of d = 4.
7Here, ai(ℓi) is a shorthand notation for a group of fully symmetric ℓi indices ai|1 ai|2 · · · ai|ℓi .

– 6 –

Before moving to the short representation, let us consider the example of the symmetric
tensor representation ℓ = (ℓ, 0, . . . , 0) =: (ℓ, 0) , whose unitary bound is given by ∆(ℓ,0) =
ℓ + d − 2 . The character is given simply by

χD(∆(ℓ,0),(ℓ,0))(q, x) = χ∆(ℓ,0),(ℓ,0)(q, x) − χ∆(ℓ,0)+1,(ℓ−1,0)(q, x) ,

(2.22)

since p = 1 in this case. This representation can be realized either as a conserved current
Oa1···aℓ on the boundary or as a symmetric gauge ﬁeld ϕµ1···µℓ in the bulk.
Short representations: singletons

The condition (2.11) leaves three exceptional cases, where we get short representations,
instead of semi-short ones, when ∆ is on the boundary of unitarity. The short represen-
tations have one less GK dimension, that is d − 1 , hence do not admit a standard ﬁeld
theoretic realization in the d + 1 dimensional bulk (see however the attempts [58]). More
suitable realization of them is as boundary conformal ﬁeld operator subject to certain
on-shell conditions.

Scalar singleton The ﬁrst case is the scalar representation, ℓ = (0, . . . , 0) =: 0 , where
the unitarity bound reads

∆0 =

.

(2.23)

d − 2

2

Above the bound ∆ > ∆0 , we get a long representation. On the border of the unitarity,
∆ = ∆0 , we have the scalar singleton,

Its character is given by

D(∆0, 0) = V(∆0, 0)(cid:14) V(∆0 + 2, 0) .

χD(∆0,0)(q, x) = χ∆0,0(q, x) − χ∆0+2,0(q, x) = q

2 (1 − q2) Pd(q, x) .

(2.24)

(2.25)

The scalar singleton representation can be realized as a conformal scalar φ on the boundary
and the subspace V(∆0 + 2, 0) corresponds to the LHS of the equation of motion for the
conformal scalar, ((cid:3) + d−2

4(d−1) R)φ = 0 .

Spinor singleton The second case is the spinor representation ℓ = ( 1
where the unitarity requires

Higher spin singleton When d is even, the representations D(∆, ℓ) with ℓ = s± :=
(s, . . . , s,±s) also develop short representations on the unitarity bound:

∆s± = s +

d − 2

2

.

(2.29)

Since the above can be also written as ∆s± = s + h− 1 , it corresponds in fact to particular
cases of (2.12). Moreover, for ℓ = 0 and 1
2 +, it coincides with the bounds (2.23) and (2.26)
for the scalar and spinor singletons. Again, above the bound the representations are long,
while on the border, we get the short representations,

D(cid:0)∆s±, s±(cid:1) = V(∆s±, s±)(cid:14)D(∆s± + 1, ¯s±) ,

where ¯s± is deﬁned in (2.15) with (¯s−)h = −(s − 1) . For a more explicit expression of
character, we deﬁne

In the integer s cases, higher spin singletons can be realized by boundary tensor ﬁelds
ϕa1(s),...,ah(s) and the subspace D(∆s± + 1, ¯s±) corresponds to the conservation condition
(2.20). In terms of dual ﬁelds,8

(2.33)

the conservation condition get simpliﬁed as

∂b1πb1[h],...,bs[h] = 0 .

(2.34)

This is the Bargmann-Wigner equation for massless higher spin ﬁeld [59]. The ± of s±
deﬁnes diﬀerent parity decompositions depending on the dimensionality. For even h (that
is d = 4m), they correspond to self-dual and anti-self-dual ﬁeld, whereas for odd h (that is
d = 4m + 2), they correspond to chiral and anti-chiral ﬁeld.

2.1.1 Examples of lower dimensions

Let us conclude the review of the UIRs and characters of so(2, d) with the examples of
lower dimensions d = 2, 3, 4 .

so(2, 2) From (2.4), the character of long representations are

χ∆,ℓ(q, x) = q∆ P2(q, x) χso(2)

with P2 and so(2) character χso(2) given by

Since so(2, 2) ≃ so(1, 2) ⊕ so(1, 2) , the above character can be decomposed into that of
so(1, 2) as

χ∆,ℓ(q, x) = χso(1,2)

and the character for so(1, 2)

Here, short representations correspond to the holomorphic or anti-holomorphic ones,

For short representations, we have scalar and spinor representations corresponding to the
characters,

(2.44)

These representations are often referred as Rac and Di following [5].

so(2, 4) Finally, in d = 4 , the characters of long representations read

χ∆,(ℓ1,ℓ2)(q, x1, x2) = q∆ P4(q, x1, x2) χso(4)

(ℓ1,ℓ2)(x1, x2) .

(2.45)

Since so(4) ≃ so(3) ⊕ so(3) , the so(4) character can be decomposed into the so(3) ones as

(ℓ1,ℓ2)(x1, x2) = χso(3)

We get the explicit form for P4 from (2.5) as

With these, the character of semi-short representations are given by

We shall use this form of the character in computing corresponding one-loop diagrams.

2.2 Decomposition of singleton tensor product
Any physical Hilbert space H of conformal ﬁeld theory in d dimensions carries a unitary
representation of so(2, d), hence can be decomposed into the UIRs as

H =M∆,ℓ

N H
D(∆,ℓ) D(∆, ℓ) ,

(2.52)

where N H
D(∆,ℓ) are the multiplicities of the UIR, D(∆, ℓ) in H . Via the state-operator and
AdS/CFT correspondences, each state carrying a UIR corresponds ﬁrst to a CFT operator
then to a bulk ﬁeld. Since all UIRs of so(2, d) are identiﬁed in the previous section, we
can determine the bulk spectrum which corresponds to H if the multiplicities N H
D(∆,ℓ) are
determined.

The typical way to extract the multiplicities from a given representation H is the

decomposition of its characters (or generalized partition function):

χH(q, x) = TrHhqE xM12

1

··· xh

Mh(h+1)i =X∆,ℓ

N H

D(∆,ℓ) χD(∆,ℓ)(q, x) ,

(2.53)

where the character χD(∆,ℓ) is given in (2.9) with (2.4). The standard partition function
ZH(q) of the theory with Hilbert space H is related to this character simply by

ZH(q) = χH(q, 1, . . . , 1) ,

(2.54)

but for the identiﬁcation of the multiplicities, we need the full dependence in x . In principle
we can use an orthogonality relation between characters to extract the multiplicities [41],

– 10 –

but in practice it is not simple to evaluate the necessary integrals. Instead, when the form
of characters are simple enough, one can use more plain functional properties.

In the following, we shall derive various decomposition formulas by concentrating on
the so(2, 3) case. Note however that this will not limit our analysis of bulk quantum eﬀect
to the d = 3 case because we shall adopt a new method later on (hence, the rest of Section
2.2 is not prerequisite for the following sections).

2.2.1 Laurent expansion of character

The key observation for the so(2, d) character decomposition is that for a few lower dimen-
sions the character take essentially a monomial form up to an overall function factor [42].
For so(2, 3), the character of V(∆, ℓ) satisﬁes

the multiplicities of V(∆, ℓ) can be obtained from Laurent expansion of the character as
(2.56)

N H

χH(q, x) .

1 − x−1
P3(q, x)

χ∆,ℓ(q, x) = q∆(cid:16)xℓ − x−ℓ−1(cid:17) ,
2πi xℓ+1 I
1 − x−1
P3(q, x)

2πi q∆+1

dx

dq

V(∆,ℓ) =I

(2.55)

Hence, with this formula, for any reducible representation H , once its character ZH(q, x)
is known, one can get the decomposition formula,

H =M∆,ℓ

N H
∆,ℓ V(∆, ℓ) ,

(2.57)

in terms of the LW representation V(∆, ℓ) . Note that in this case, the multiplicity N H
V(∆,ℓ)
might be negative integers. Afterwards, the decomposition (2.52) in terms of UIRs can
be obtained by recollecting V(∆, ℓ)’s into D(∆, ℓ)’s, then the multiplicities N H
D(∆,ℓ) are
non-negative integers.

2.2.2 Oscillator representation

For d = 3 case, the oscillator representation of singletons [60, 61] has proven crucial in
describing higher spin algebra as well as the Vasiliev’s equations.
It is also useful in
studying the Flato-Fronsdal theorem [5] and its extensions [62]. In this section, we show
how the oscillator representation can be used to analyze the decomposition rule of the
generic singleton tensor products,

H = Di⊗q ⊗ Rac⊗p−q ,

(2.58)

where Di and Rac refers (following the standard terminology [5]) respectively the spinor
and scalar singleton representation: Di = D(1, 1
2 , 0) . This generalizes the
Flato-Fronsdal theorem, to the cases of generic powers,

The singleton representations of so(2, 3) algebra are realized by two sets of oscillators:

[ a , a† ] = 1 = [ b , b† ] .

(2.60)

In terms of these oscillators, the generators of so(2) ⊕ so(3) are given by
E =

J+ = a† b ,

J3 =

J− = b† a . (2.61)

2(cid:16)a† a + b† b + 1(cid:17) ,

The lowering operators are given by

M −

M −

+ = b2 ,

M −

3 = a b ,

(2.62)

and raising operators as the complex conjugate of the above. In this oscillator representa-
tion of so(2, 3), two singletons, Di and Rac, are given as follows:

• Rac is the representation whose lowest weight state is the Fock vacuum |0i with
a|0i = 0 = b|0i . Obviously the lowering operators (2.62) annihilate this state, and
generic states of the Rac representation are constructed by acting raising operators
on |0i,

(2.63)
Hence, they have even number of oscillators. By acting E and J3 on |0i , we can
immediately see that |0i deﬁnes D( 1

3)ℓ |0i = (a†)2m+ℓ (b†)2n+ℓ |0i .

(M +

• Di is the representation whose lowest weight state is the doublet a† |0i⊕ b† |0i . Since
these states involve only one creation operator, they are still annihilated by the
lowering operators (2.62). The generic states of Di have odd number of oscillators.
By acting E and J3 on a†|0i (the highest J3 state), we ﬁnd the doublet vacuum
deﬁnes D(1, 1
2 ) .

Higher spin algebra This oscillator representation makes clear that the higher spin
algebra is the maximal symmetry of singleton representations, namely the endomorphism
of Rac (or Di) [61]. Since the singletons are constructed by acting the creation operators
a† and b† on the Fock vacuum (or the doublet a† |0i ⊕ b† |0i for Di), any operators even
orders in oscillators,

(a†)m (b†)n a p b q

[m + n + p + q ∈ 2 N] ,

(2.64)

belongs to the endomorphism, so the higher spin symmetry. The precise relation to the
usual oscillators of high spin algebra reads

y1 = a + b† ,

y2 = i (a† − b) ,

¯y ˙α = (yα)† .

Tensor product We now consider tensor products of p singleton representations. They
are realized by p × 2 sets of oscillators:

[ ai , a†

j ] = δij = [ bi , b†
j ]

[i = 1, . . . , p] .

A generator T of so(2, 3) is represented by

T = T1 + ··· + Tp ,

(2.66)

(2.67)

where Ti is the representation given only by the i-th oscillators. For instance, we have

E =

We are looking for LW states in the k singleton tensor product space. Such LW states
are not singlet under so(3) so we focus only on the highest J3 state among the so(2, 3)
LW states. Such a state with (E, J3) = (∆, s) is an eigenstate of the number operators

Now, let us consider tensor products of Di’s and Rac’s. The Fock space of Di and Rac
are constructed by odd and even numbers of oscillators, respectively. Hence, Di and Rac
carry the alternating (−1) and the trivial (+1) representations of Z2 = {1, σ} generated by
the oscillator sign ﬂip operation σ : (cid:0)a†, b†(cid:1) 7→ (cid:0)−a†,−b†(cid:1). When considering the tensor
product of k singletons, the group Z2 extends to Z⊗p

(ǫ1, . . . , ǫp) representation of Z⊗p
of the (na, nb)

(na,nb) = N [q,p−q]

where N (ǫ1,...,ǫp)
(na,nb) are the multiplicities (q is the number of Di’s) and it also gives
the multiplicities of the tensor product decompositions. Therefore, the tensor product
rule for S(±1) can be written as (2.59). The explicit expression for N [q,p−q]
(n+2s,n) can be found
using the combinatorics and its generating function turns out to coincide with the so(2, 3)
character. See Appendix A for the details.

2.3 Single trace operators

So far, in considering tensor products of singletons, we have not taken any permutation
symmetry of singletons into account. Let us denote such tensor-product spaces as

T (n)(V ) = V1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ Vn ,

(2.80)

where Vi is the space of singleton representation and the subscript i is introduced to
distinguish diﬀerent copies of V . Notice however that the single trace operators (2.1) are
invariant under cyclic permutations of ∂kφ’s due to the cyclicity of trace. This means that
the space of the n-th order single trace operators corresponds not to T (n)(V ) but to the
subspace T (n)

cyc(V ) ⊂ T (n)(V ),

T (n)

cyc(V ) = Mπ∈Cn

Vπ(1) ⊗ ··· ⊗ Vπ(n) =

n

Mi=1

Vi ⊗ Vi+1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ Vn ⊗ V1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ Vi−1 ,

(2.81)

which is invariant under the actions of the cyclic group Cn. Therefore, when single trace
operators admit symmetries such as cyclic permutations, we have to decompose the prop-
erly symmetrized tensor product of singletons into the UIRs of so(2, d) . Depending on the

– 14 –

symmetry of the space, single trace operators have diﬀerent symmetries, hence diﬀerent
tensor product should be used. In this paper, we focus on the CFT where the scalar ﬁeld φ
takes value in the adjoint representation of SU (N ) : under the action of an SU (N ) element
a , the ﬁeld transforms as

φ → a φ a−1 .

(2.82)

In this case, the matrix φ does not admit any particular symmetry and its single trace
operators, invariant under (2.82), only admit the cyclic symmetries. The character of the
cyclic tensor-product space T (n)

cyc(V ) is no more [χV (g)]n but given by [35–42]

χcycn(g) =

1

nXk|n

ϕ(k)(cid:16)χV (gk)(cid:17) n

k

(cid:2) gk = (qk, xk

1, . . . , xk

h)(cid:3),

(2.83)

where k|n means the k ∈ {1, . . . , n} which divides n and ϕ(k) is the Euler totient function
which counts the number of relative primes of k in {1, . . . , k} . The derivation of the
above character is a result of the Polya’s enumeration theorem. Hence, the character
for the entire space of singlet trace operators is given by the sum of (2.83) over n ≥ 2
(the n = 1 contribution drops out due to Tr(φ) = 0). By changing the summation as
P∞
n=1Pk|n =P∞
m=1 with n = m k , we can perform the summation over m and get

(2.84)

k=1P∞
Xn=2

χadj(g) =

χcycn(g) = −χV (g) −

By decomposing this character into the UIRs, we can identify the spectrum of all single trace
operators in the free scalar SU (N ) model. We remark here that the above formula relies on
the inﬁnite summation over m giving the log function. Hence, it turns out that the partition
function develops singularities at ﬁnite non-zero values of β in contrast to the vector models
[63]. When the CFTd is placed on S1 × Sd−1, β has the physical interpretation of inverse
temperature and this divergence is related to the Hagedorn phase transition [19, 20]. In our
case β is just a parameter which is useful for counting conformal dimensions of primaries.
Nonetheless, we will see that these singularities play an important role in our vacuum
energy computations and indeed introduce new ambiguities and subtleties not presented
in the vector model CFT holography.

2.4 Explicit Examples of Decompositions

Let us conclude this section with a few examples of singleton tensor-product decomposi-
tions. We consider various bosonic tensor-products of Rac’s and Di’s up to order four.
About the single trace operators, we conﬁne ourselves to the scalar ﬁeld cases, that involve
only Rac’s. In O(p) Young diagrams, the number of boxes cannot exceed p for the ﬁrst two
columns. Therefore, the decomposition rules for two and three singleton tensor-products
are particularly simple.

We can also obtain the spectrum of single trace operators for the SU (N ) adjoint model,
but the formula become too lengthy and does not seem to be illuminating.

It is worth to note that the spectra with four ﬁelds contain the operators D(s + 2, s− 1)
of twist 3 = (s + 2) − (s − 1) which can be interpreted as the one dual to the higher spin
Goldstone modes [36–38, 40]. In fact, only the order four and six can give this contributions
because the minimum twist τ = ∆ − s of the spectrum is larger than n/2 where n is the
number of the conformal ﬁelds. The massless higher spin ﬁelds from the order two may
acquire masses after combining with these modes from the order four or six. The fact that
the Goldstone modes arises at these orders is the particularity of three dimensional scalar
models where the conformal weight of scalar ﬁeld is 1/2 hence requires two or four more
orders to give the Goldstone ones. In four dimensions where scalar ﬁeld has weight one,
only the order three operators can give the Goldstone modes. In particular, the operator
dual to the scalar Goldstone can trigger a marginal deformation.

As one can see from the above results, the analytic formulas for the multiplicities of
single trace operators become highly non-trivial as the number of Rac increases: the order
four cyclic result would not ﬁt in a single page. Consequently, the summation of physical
quantities over such spectrum becomes practically intractable apart from a ﬁrst few powers
of Rac. In the following sections, we nevertheless makes use of this decomposition for some
concrete calculations, but eventually proceed in a new approach.

3 AdS/CFT and Bulk Vacuum Energy

In this paper, we aim to study the AdS theory which is dual to free scalar CFT in adjoint
representation of SU (N ) by computing their one-loop vacuum energy. Before entering to
the analysis of AdS side, let us remind the general picture behind this correspondence.

3.1 Holography for Free Matrix Model CFTs

Let us ﬁrst consider the CFT side which is described by a scalar action SCFT[φ] where φ
takes value in a matrix space of dimension N . For a SU (N ) adjoint model, N = N 2 − 1 .
Let {OI
∆,ℓ} denote the full set of single trace primary operators: ∆ and ℓ are the labels for
the conformal weight and spin,9 and I is for the multiplicity. The connected correlators of
single trace operators take the form,

∆1,ℓ1

(x1) ··· OIn

∆n,ℓn

(xn)(cid:11)con =Xk

C {Ii}
{∆i,ℓi} k Gk

{∆i,ℓi}({xi}) ,

(3.1)

9In more than four spacetime dimensions, ℓ indicates the set of all quantum numbers required to specify

the spin of the ﬁeld.

– 17 –

where the functions Gk
{∆i,ℓi}({xi}) are the model independent tensor structures (labeled
by k) allowed by the conformal symmetry, whereas the coeﬃcients C {Ii}
{∆i,ℓi} k encode the
particularity of the model10. In the convention that the operators are not normalized by
N , the coeﬃcients C (with the labels {Ii}

{∆i,ℓi} k suppressed) admit a 1/N expansion:

C = N C (0) + C (1) +

1
N

C (2) + ··· .

(3.2)

A particular property of free CFTs is that the 1/N expansion becomes exact with the
leading term alone: C (n≥1) = 0 . This property is a triviality from the CFT point of view,
but it imposes a highly non-trivial requirement to the dual theory in AdS. Before moving
to the AdS side, let us rephrase this property in terms of the generating function FCFT[h]
of connected correlators. The latter admits the path-integral representation,

exp (−FCFT[h]) =Z Dφ exp(cid:18) − SCFT[φ] +Z ddx X∆,ℓ,I(cid:10) hI

∆,ℓ(cid:11)(cid:19) ,

∆,ℓ(cid:12)(cid:12)OI

(3.3)

where hI
Again, FCFT of a generic matrix-model CFT admits a 1/N expansion:

∆,ℓ are the sources for single trace operators and h·|·i means the index contraction.

The AdS theory has the ﬁeld contents {ϕI

∆,ℓ} (with the masses (2.19)) which are in
one-to-one correspondence with the single trace operators. The conjecture states that the
CFT physical quantity FCFT[h] coincides with the AdS one ΓAdS[h] given by

(3.8)

The classical actions SAdS[ϕ] of the AdS theories dual to free scalar matrix models are not
known, but the correspondence gives us various information about them:

• The massless sector of SAdS coincides with the Vasiliev’s theory, because free matrix
models always have inﬁnitely many conserved currents operators which are bilinear
in φ and their correlators remains the same as the vector model case.

• The massive higher spin ﬁelds, which are the complement to the Vasiliev’s spectrum in
SAdS , behave as matter sectors of the Vasiliev’s higher spin gauge theory. Moreover,
they consist of an inﬁnite number of multiplets of Vasiliev’s higher spin algebra:
singleton can be regarded as the fundamental representation of Vasiliev algebra, and
any its tensor products provide faithful representations of the algebra.

• Since free CFTs do not have any coupling constant, the only parameter that SAdS
involves is the cosmological constant or the radius R of AdS. This in turn combines
with the gravitational constant G to form a dimensionless constant,

g := R1−d G .

(3.9)

The latter should be related to the dimensionless parameter N of the CFT.

• As we discussed above, the correlators of free CFTs have the same tensor structure for
any value of N . This implies that higher order loop corrections of Witten diagram
at AdS dual theory should have the same tensor structure. This implies that the
AdS dual theory cannot have diﬀerent tensor structures for its Witten diagrams in
diﬀerent loop orders. Hence, they should be all proportional to the leading-order one,

Gℓ Γ(ℓ)

AdS[h] = nℓ gℓ Γ(0)

AdS[h] ,

where nℓ are dimensionless constants. Furthermore, we have

Γ(0)

AdS[h] = SAdS[ϕ(h)] .

Hence, for a free CFT holography, we should have

CFT[h] = n(g) R1−d SAdS[ϕ(h)] ,

By expanding the action SAdS around AdS background in the power of ﬁelds as

SAdS[ϕ] = S0 + S2[ϕ] + S3[ϕ] + ··· ,

(3.13)

each interaction terms can be constructed in principle by comparing the corresponding
Witten diagrams with the CFT correlators. For the quadratic and cubic terms S2 and
S3 , it is suﬃcient to attach the boundary-to-bulk propagators to the vertices.
In [68–
71], all the cubic interactions for massive and massless symmetric higher spin ﬁelds have
been constructed for their transverse and traceless pieces, which are enough for the on-shell
calculations.11 The quartic term S4 is more subtle as it requires to subtract inﬁnitely many
exchange diagrams, and a certain non-locality of interaction may start to appear from this
order. In [73, 74], the scalar quartic interaction of Vasiliev’s theory has been identiﬁed in
this way and it has been shown that its form is indeed a non-local one.12

3.2 Bulk Vacuum Energy and Zeta Function

If the classical action SAdS can be constructed from the holographic correspondence, then
the conjecture becomes tautological in a sense at least at the classical level. A non-trivial
test of the conjecture would be to calculate n-point functions starting from a given form
of classical theory. The calculation of 3-pt correlators from Vasiliev’s theory corresponds
to this case: the task has been carried out in [76] showing an agreement with the free
Vector models. See [77–81] for further examinations based on a diﬀerent technique.13 On
the contrary to the Vasiliev’s theories, which are dual to the free vector models, the AdS
theories dual to free matrix models are not known. The best guess is that it can be again
described by a Vasiliev type equations extended by a certain matter sector. Anyway, as
the classical theory is not known, the only available test of the correspondence would be
the property (3.12): the quantum eﬀects should be proportional to the semi-classical ones.
In the following, we consider the simplest case of the quantum eﬀect: the one-loop
(ℓ = 1) diagram without any leg (n = 0) in (3.8), namely the vacuum energy. In principle,
the vacuum energy cannot provide a rigorous test for (3.12) since it only returns a number
rather than a tensor structure.14 However, since this number is typically a rather special
rational or transcendental number, it may allow us to guess what the whole picture should
look like. The vacuum energies of higher spin theories have been calculated for the vector
model dualities [6–8] as well as some related extensions [9–17]. As we shall comment later,
it has lead to an interesting guess on the relation between N and g .

11Recently, the AdS cubic vertex which gives the 3-pt functions of the free scalar CFT has been determined

in [72]. This vertex ought to be the metric-like form of the cubic interaction of Vasiliev’s theory.

12Once one accepts that a certain non-locality cannot be avoided, then one needs to distinguish a good
non-locality from the bad ones whose introduction to classical actions spoils the predictability. See [75] for
a recent discussion.

13For a certain type of 3pt correlators, a straightforward perturbative calculation involves some subtleties
as reported in [82, 83] in relation with the allowed class of ﬁeld redeﬁnitions (see also [84, 85]). Hence, it
would be fair to say that there still remains several issues to understand about the holography of Vasiliev’s
theory.

14Strictly speaking, for the test, we need to consider the 3-pt correlators where diﬀerent tensor structures
start to enter. The 2-pt correlator is unique once the masses of ﬁelds are tuned by the conformal dimensions
of the single trace operators.

S2[π] = X∆,ℓ,I

S∆,ℓ[πI ] .

(3.15)

So far, we were using shorthand notations for πI
∆,ℓ which are actually AdS tensor ﬁelds
πI
µ(ℓ1),...,µ(ℓh) carrying in general a mixed symmetry representation ℓ under the Lorentz
symmetry. The precise form of the action S∆,ℓ describing the D(∆, ℓ) representation is
non-trivial and generically requires to introduce traces and possibly other set of auxiliary
ﬁelds. See [86–92] and references therein for the construction of such classical actions. For
our purpose — which is to evaluate the vacuum energy diagrams — we need anyway to
reduce the action to the traceless and transverse gauge where the form of the action is
simpliﬁed to

S∆,ℓ[πTT] =

1

2 Z dd+1x√gAdS πµ(ℓ1),...,µ(ℓh)

D∆,ℓ πTT µ(ℓ1),...,µ(ℓh) ,

(3.16)

where the diﬀerential operator D∆,ℓ = (cid:3) − M 2
∆,ℓ is deﬁned with the mass term (2.19).
Here, we assumed that the corresponding representations are long ones. In case of short
representations, the path-integral should be supplemented by the proper Jacobian (or ghost
contribution) — which eventually amounts to extending the ﬁeld content (labeled by I)
to include the ghost ﬁelds with negative counting. The Laplacian operator (cid:3) depends
on the tensor ﬁeld that it acts on, speciﬁed by ℓ . Since the mass term will only shift
the eigenvalues of D∆,ℓ from those of (cid:3) by an additive constant, we will mostly concern
ourselves with the spectral problem for the Laplacian. The path-integral can be formally
evaluated to give

∆,ℓ =PI is the multiplicity of the ﬁelds V(∆, ℓ) including the ghost contributions

For homogeneous spaces like spheres and hyperboloids (Euclidean AdS), the coincident

k∆,ℓ(t) := K∆,ℓ

µ(x, x; t) ,

(3.21)

where the volume of AdS, VolAdS , is a divergent quantity which requires a regularization.
Besides this AdS IR divergence, we also have the usual UV divergences coming from the
loop integrals. In the representation (3.18), it arises from the small t integral region, which
corresponds to the short-distance heat propagation. This UV divergence can be regularized
by a Mellin transform, namely the zeta function ζ∆,ℓ , as

To summarize, the one-loop vacuum energy of the AdS theory is given by the function
ζH(z) (3.23), which is determined by the multiplicity of the spectrum N∆,ℓ and the spectral
zeta function ζ∆,ℓ (3.22). The calculation of the latter has been solved in great detail using
group theoretic properties of AdS spaces [43–47], as we shall shortly review. About the
∆,ℓ, we extract the spectrum {ϕI
multiplicity N H
∆,ℓ} of AdS ﬁelds by identifying it with the
spectrum {OI
∆,ℓ} of conformal primaries in the dual CFT in the N → ∞ limit. This is in
any case a necessary condition for the validity of the given AdS/CFT duality.

– 22 –

Even then the problem of arriving at the total one-loop vacuum energy is still non-
trivial since, as we saw, the general expression for the multiplicity of conformal primaries
in a free CFT rapidly becomes very complicated as we start including contributions from
higher and higher powers of singletons φ . We will shortly see this very explicitly for the
case of AdS4.

4 AdS4 with S3 Boundary

The ﬁrst case we study is the computation of the one-loop vacuum energy in AdS4 with S3
boundary. This was also the ﬁrst case that was considered in the higher spin/CFT duality
computations for matching the one-loop free energy for Vasiliev higher spin theories with
their CFT duals, the U (N ) and O(N ) vector models [6]. While the vector models have a
relatively simple spectrum of conformal primaries, as the spectrum involves only the square
of singletons, the SU (N ) adjoint model has a far richer spectrum as now arbitrarily high
powers of singletons may be taken. In this respect, the case of AdS4 is particularly simple
because it cannot have any mixed symmetry tensor representations.

4.1 Zeta Functions of AdS4 Fields

Fields in AdS4 are labeled by their so(2, 3) quantum numbers (∆, s). The spectral zeta
function for a ﬁeld labeled by these quantum numbers is given by [45]

ζ∆,s(z) =

where D∆(z, u) and Ss(u) are

"u +(cid:18) 2 s + 1

2 (cid:19)2# .

(4.2)

We shall provide two strategies for evaluating the zeta function of matrix model CFTs.
First, we shall work explicitly with the spectra of conformal primaries obtained from con-
sidering powers of singletons and sum over the contributions of each such ﬁeld. We shall
ﬁnd that this method quickly becomes prohibitive for two reasons. Firstly, as already en-
countered in the case of vector models [6, 7], these sums are naively divergent and need
to be regularized. Secondly, the spectrum of conformal primaries becomes increasingly
complicated as higher powers of singletons are taken. This leads us to consider an alterna-
tive method for computing the zeta function, using the character (or generalized partition
function) of the dual CFT.

∆,s(0) for Rac⊗2/T (2)

cyc(Rac), the case

For the vacuum-energy of the AdS theory under consideration, we need to use the
tensor products T (n)
cyc . However, as we have seen in Section 2.4, the decomposition rule
becomes quickly complicated as n increases. Hence, in the following, we will conduct the
calculations ﬁrst for the ‘toy models’ Rac⊗3 and Rac⊗4 in order to see how the methods
adopted in [6, 7] can be extended to the SU (N ) adjoint model.

First, to compute the zeta function that includes the contribution of all the AdS ﬁelds
corresponding to the conformal primaries contained in Rac⊗3 we use the decomposition rule
(2.88), and regulate the inﬁnite sum over spins using zeta function regularisation. Firstly,
it is easy to see that ζRac⊗3(0) vanishes:

This completes the explicit evaluation of the zeta functions for the conformal primaries
contained in Rac⊗3 and Rac⊗4. Even though we managed to get the results, it is hard
to continue this method to higher order of singletons as the decomposition rules becomes
quickly very complicated. Moreover if we consider the realistic matrix models instead of
the toy models of Rac⊗n, even the order four level becomes highly non-trivial and it makes
the computation more prohibitive. We now turn to an alternative approach to the same
problem, which turns out to be of greater utility as it allows the powers of the singleton to
increase.

4.3 Zeta Function from Character

We have seen above that while it is in principle possible to carry out a brute-force eval-
uation of the summation of the vacuum energies for higher powers of singletons, it is in
practice quite prohibitive both due to increasing complexity of the spectrum and the careful
regularization required at several steps in the calculation. We now introduce an alternative
approach to the problem, based on the fact that the spectrum of conformal primaries is
encoded in the corresponding character, namely the generalized partition function of the
CFT. In particular, we would aim to write the zeta function corresponding to a given con-
formal primary in terms of the corresponding so(2, 3) character, and then formally carry
out the sum over characters and multiplicities to write an expression for the zeta function
for all the bulk ﬁelds in one go. As a starting point, we will rewrite the character (2.41) of
V(∆, s) in the form

χ∆,s(β, α) =

(4.21)

Using (4.18) and (4.19), the zeta function ζ∆,s is related to the character χ∆,s as

where µ(z, β) and ν(z, β) are independent of ∆ and s. Their expressions are given by

(4.22)

Notice that µ(z, β) and ν(z, β) are simply ﬁxed functions hence the relation (4.20) can
be extended from V(∆, s) to any Hilbert space H . In other words, it deﬁnes a universal
relation between the spectral zeta function and the character. However, the identiﬁcation
of the functions µ(z, β) and ν(z, β) are non-trivial. When z = 0, the functions µ(z, β) and
ν(z, β) have the simple form.

µ(0, β) =

(4.23)

Let us notice that if we use µ(0, β) and ν(0, β) instead of µ(z, β) and ν(z, β) , then the β
integral will be divergent: the z-dependence was introduced precisely to regularize this UV
divergence. Since we have freedom to choose convenient regularization scheme, we suggest
a modiﬁcation of zeta function (4.20) to

which makes use of slightly diﬀerent z-dependence which nevertheless does regularize the
integral. Explicit comparison with the standard zeta function shows that their value at
z = 0 coincide with each other implying that the log divergence of vacuum energy coincide.
Moreover, they have the same ﬁrst derivatives — proportional to the ﬁnite part of the
vacuum energy — for the character which is even in β . This is the case for Rac itself as
well as any tensor product of it. Therefore, for our purpose, the formula (4.24) is fully
equivalent to the standard zeta function up to the z2 order which is physically irrelevant.
The details of the comparison can be found in Appendix B.

4.4 A Few Tests

4.4.1 Vector Models

Before analyzing the matrix models, we revisit the vector models as testing examples of
the new method with ˜ζH . The spectrum of non-minimal Vasiliev theory is given by the
character

χnon-min(β, α) = χRac

2(β, α) ,

(4.25)

where the character of Rac is given in (2.44) in (q = e−β, x = ei α) , which can be re-
expressed in (β, α) as

χRac(β, α) =

cosh β
2

By plugging (4.25) to (4.24), we ﬁnd that the integrand itself vanishes, hence

cosh β − cos α

.

˜ζnon-min(z) = 0 .

(4.26)

(4.27)

As a result, both of the log divergent and ﬁnite parts are zero.

In the case of the minimal Vasiliev theory dual to free scalar O(N ) vector model, the

character is given by

χmin(β, α) =

χ2

Rac(β, α) + χRac(2β, 2α)

2

.

(4.28)

Since the χ2
the second term χRac(2β, 2α)/2 . After some manipulation, one can show that

Rac = χnon-min gives vanishing zeta function, the only contribution comes from

˜ζmin(z) = 4−z ˜ζRac(z) = ˜ζRac(z) + O(z2) ,

where ˜ζRac(z) reads

˜ζRac(z) = ζ(2z − 2, 1

(4.30)

Interestingly, ˜ζRac reproduces the vacuum energy of the conformal scalar on the boundary.15
Therefore, the examples of vector models shows the agreement.

4.4.2 Toy Models: Rac⊗3 and Rac⊗4

Let us move to the toy model examples of Rac⊗n . The corresponding vacuum energies
have been calculated in Section 4.2, and in below, we shall check whether the new method
can reproduce the result correctly. The character for Rac⊗n is simply

χRac⊗n(β, α) = χRac

n(β, α) ,

and the corresponding spectral zeta function leads to the integral,

By comparing these with the results (4.9) and (4.15) obtained in Section 4.2 by summation
over the ﬁeld content, we ﬁnd the these results exactly matches to those. One can see that
compared to the calculations in Section 4.2, the new integral representation ˜ζH(z) requires
a considerably shorter calculation.

4.5 Vacuum Energy for the AdS Dual of SU (N ) Adjoint Model

Now, let us turn to the vacuum energy of the AdS theory dual to the SU (N ) adjoint matrix
model.

4.5.1 Vacuum Energies for the ﬁrst Few Regge Trajectories

To begin with, we calculate the spectral zeta function for the ﬁrst few Regge trajectories,
that is, for the ﬁrst few orders in the power of singleton φ . In the end, the total vacuum
energy is the sum of the ones of the order from two to inﬁnity.

Order Two At the order two, the ﬁeld content coincides with that of the minimal Vasiliev
theory hence their vacuum energies coincides with that of Rac:

where ψ(n) is the polygamma function of order n . The order three trajectory has more

property of the order two does not seem to continue to the order three.

The vacuum energy of the fourth order trajectory is increased again compared to the order
three, but only by a small amount.

Higher Orders
In order to see a pattern, we can proceed with a few more orders: the
vacuum energies of the ﬁrst 8 order Regge trajectories are plotted in Fig. 1. One can see
that the energies exhibit a rough linear growth. Assuming that the pattern continues, we
can conclude that the total vacuum energy — the sum of all vacuum energies in diﬀerent
trajectories — will be divergent. Therefore, we need to perform a regularization yet another
time. If we had analytic expressions for the vacuum energies for diﬀerent orders, we may
consider various possible regularizations, but unfortunately we could not ﬁnd the analytic
formula.

4.5.2 Vacuum Energies in Diﬀerent Slices

In the previous section, we have calculated the vacuum energy of the AdS theory for the
ﬁrst few Regge trajectories, which show a growing pattern. In this section, we will consider

Working with a ﬁxed value of k corresponds to considering the full vacuum energy as a
series in k . To distinguish with the previous organization of the spectrum of primaries
into Regge trajectories, we refer to all the primaries appearing with a ﬁxed k as belonging
to the same ‘slice’. The evaluation of the above integral is technically prohibitive, but
one can easily check that the above two functions vanish when z = 0 , implying that the
vacuum energy is free from the logarithmic UV divergence. The renormalized vacuum
energy corresponding to the ﬁrst derivative of ˜ζlog,k is not easily accessible by analytic
method. We can nevertheless proceed numerically (see Appendix B), but the validity of
such result is not fully clear.

In the above, we were attacking the computation of the vacuum energy of the AdS
theory dual to SU (N ) adjoint model as two diﬀerent series: one as a series of the order

– 31 –

of ﬁelds (considered in Section 4.5.1), and the other as a series with a ﬁxed Euler totient
function (considered in Section 4.5.2).
In both case, we could obtain the contributions
for a few low orders, but an analytic expression for whole sequence was not available. At
this point, one may wonder whether we can consider the full character where diﬀerent
k contributions are summed up.
In a sense, this idea seems to be in the continuation
of our reasoning: whenever we face a series which is divergent, we consider directly the
character which originates the series. However at this time, the situation is diﬀerent.
Clearly, the full character for the adjoint model has an inﬁnite number of singularities at
β = βc
k , where βc is the singular point for the k = 1 part. Moreover, around β = 0, the
singularities corresponding higher k values are accumulated making the character highly
non-analytic around β = 0 point. Hence, if we consider the full character function, it seems
to be impossible to control the divergence arising from the small β region because its non-
analyticity is severe. Therefore, the only well-deﬁned ways to address the adjoint models
would be what we have been considered here: as a series in the order of trajectories or as
a series in the order of ‘slices’.

5 AdS5 with S4 Boundary

We now extend the approach of writing the bulk zeta function in terms of the character
— that is, the generalized partition function — of the boundary CFT to the case of AdS5.
This is the ﬁrst instance where ﬁelds of mixed symmetry make an appearance. Since the
case of completely symmetric ﬁelds is well understood [45] and has already been applied
to this context in [7], we omit that discussion and consider directly the most general case
of mixed symmetry ﬁelds.

5.1 Zeta Functions of AdS5 Fields

We start from an AdS5 ﬁeld that labelled by the so(2, 4) quantum numbers (∆, (ℓ1, ℓ2)).
Furthermore, we assume this to be a long representation of the conformal algebra, as
characters of (semi-)short representations can be written as sums and diﬀerences of char-
acters of long representations. It was observed in [43–47] that for many classes of ﬁelds
— including symmetric transverse traceless tensors, spinors, and p-forms — the coincident
heat kernel for the Laplacian on AdS2n+1 is simply obtained by an analytic continuation16
of the corresponding quantity on S2n+1. Inspired by these lessons, we will compute the
heat kernel over generic mixed symmetry ﬁelds on AdS5 by relating it to a heat kernel
over S5 via analytic continuation. We now describe how this is done, using the following
results from harmonic analysis on spheres. Let S be the space of ﬁelds on a ﬁve-sphere
S5 = SO(6)/SO(5), then the space S carries a UIR of SO(5) . The eigenvalues of the
Laplacian acting on S are determined by the quadratic Casimirs QR of the UIRs R of
SO(6) whose restriction to SO(5) include the representation S . By imposing irreducibility
conditions (such as transversality or tracelessness) on the ﬁelds, one can further constrain
the permitted set of Rs. Then by deﬁnition, the traced and integrated heat kernel is given
16Subtleties related to even dimensional spheres and hyperboloids are discussed at length in [43, 45–47].

KS (t) =XR|S

(5.1)

where R|S means that all the UIR R of SO(6) whose restriction to SO(5) include S . The
degeneracy of the eigenvalue, dR, is given by the dimension of the representation R . Using
the homogeneity of the sphere, we conclude that the corresponding coincident heat kernel
is given by

kS (t) =XR|S

dR
VolS5

e−t QR.

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)

More concretely, we consider the space of the ﬁelds on S5 which transforms in

S = (ℓ1, ℓ2)

[ℓ1 ≥ ℓ2 ≥ 0] ,

representation of SO(5) and satisfy irreducibility conditions. Then, the SO(6) UIRs which
can branch into S are

R = (ℓ0, ℓ1,±ℓ2)

[ℓ0 ≥ ℓ1] .

Hence, for a given S, namely (ℓ1, ℓ2), we have one free integer parameter ℓ0 for R and the
choice of the sign in ±ℓ2 . The dimension dR of the above represention is

dR = d(ℓ0,ℓ1,±ℓ2) =

(ℓ0 + 2)2 − (ℓ1 + 1)2

22 − 12

(ℓ0 + 2)2 − ℓ2

2

22 − 02

(ℓ1 + 1)2 − ℓ2

2

12 − 02

,

(5.5)

and it does not depend on the sign in ±ℓ2 . Moreover the quadratic Casimirs also do not
depend on this sign: Q(ℓ0,ℓ1,+ℓ2) = Q(ℓ0,ℓ1,−ℓ2) , hece the coincident heat kernel k(ℓ1,ℓ2)(t)
receives the same contribution twice, once from (ℓ0, ℓ1, +ℓ2) and the other time from
(ℓ0, ℓ1,−ℓ2). By imposing a duality condition on S , one can also restrict R to one of
these two.

The corresponding computation for AdS5 is more subtle because AdS5 = SO(1, 5)/SO(5),

and SO(1, 5) being non-compact admits inﬁnite dimensional unitary irreducible represen-
tations. It has been explicitly demonstrated for many classes of ﬁelds in [43–47] that the
coincident heat kernel (5.2) on S5 may be analytically continued to that on AdS5 via

ℓ0 7→ i u − 2

[0 < u < ∞] .

(5.6)

Moreover the sum over ℓ0 gets mapped to an integral over u and t becomes −t , and we
obtain

du µ(u; ℓ1, ℓ2) et Q(i u−2,ℓ1,ℓ2),

is known as the Plancherel measure and intuitively corresponds to the degeneracy of the
eigenvalue Q(i u−2,ℓ1,ℓ2). It was observed in [93] that to reproduce the thermal partition

function of a conformal primary D(∆, (ℓ1, ℓ2)) , one has to consider quadratic ﬂuctuations of
ﬁelds carrying the representation (i u − 2, ℓ1, ℓ2) of SO(6) , but the eigenvalues of the kinetic
operator should be shifted such that the coincident heat kernel of the kinetic operator is
replaced by

du µ(u; ℓ1, ℓ2) e−t[u2+(∆−2)2] .

(5.9)

k∆,(ℓ1,ℓ2)(t) =Z ∞

On going through these replacements and taking the Mellin transform, we arrive at the

analysis, it is convenient to work also with the su(2) ⊕ su(2) label [j+, j−] together with
the so(4) one (ℓ1, ℓ2) . The relation between [j+, j−] and (ℓ1, ℓ2) is given by (2.47), and the
function S[j+,j−] = S(ℓ1,ℓ2) reads

Finally, the volume of AdS5 can be regularized to

VolAdS5 = π2 log(µ R) ,

as in [94]. Hence, the IR regularized vacuum energy in AdS5 is proportional to the logarithm
of the AdS radius R and the holographic renormalization scale µ . Hereafter, we suppress
the dependence of µ as it always appears with R .

5.2 Zeta Function from Character

Next we will show how this zeta function may be written in terms of the character (2.45)
of the representation V(∆, [j+, j−]) . The latter is given in the variables (β, α+, α−) , with
q = e−β and x± = ei α± , by

χ∆,[j+,j−](β, α+, α−) =

e−(∆−2)β sin(cid:16) 2 j++1

In the formula (5.10) for the zeta function, we replace the factor D∆ (5.11) by

The left hand sides of (5.17) and (5.18) involve the depedence in ∆ and j± only through

e−(∆−2) β and sin(cid:16) 2 j++1

2 α−(cid:17) which are nothing but the numerator of the

character χ∆,[j+,j−] (5.15). Therefore, similarly to AdS4 case, this observation allows to
relate the zeta function ζ∆,[j+,j−] to the character χ∆,[j+,j−] . An important advantage from
the AdS4 case — where tanh πu term (4.22) complicates the integral — is that the original
u-integral in (5.10) can be exactly evaluated in AdS5 as

(5.26)

where N H
∆,[j+,j−] is the multiplicity of V(∆, [j+, j−]) representation in the space H . The
existence of such relation is due to the fact that the formulas are linear and do not involve
any explicit dependence on ∆ or j± .

Let us emphasize that in AdS5 it was not necessary to change the regularization scheme
from the ordinary zeta function ζH to a deformed one ˜ζH as in AdS4 . Hence, what we shall
compute in the following are the standard zeta functions. This should be the case also for
other odd dimensional AdS spaces where the absence of tanh πu term makes possible to
evaluate the u integral.

Another important property of AdS5 zeta function, which should hold in other odd
dimensions, is the presence of gamma functions in the right hand sides of the formula
(5.21). Thanks to this property, one can easily show that the UV divergence of the vacuum
energy — corresponding to ζH(0) — is universally absent, as is a well-known fact of odd
dimensions:

Moreover the ﬁnite part of the vacuum energy will be entirely captured by the divergence
arising from the neighborhood of β = 0 . If the function fH|n does not have any singularity
around the positive real axis of β except for the pole at β = 0, then the integral (5.27)
with a suﬃcient large Re(z) can be recast into to the contour integral,

where the contour encircles the branch cut generated by β2(z−1−n) in the counter-clockwise
direction (see Fig. 2).

Figure 2. Integration contour for the zeta function

Diﬀerently from the form (5.27), the above contour integral is well-deﬁned for any
value of z , hence we can directly put z = 0 . With this evaluation, the integrand becomes

(5.29)

Practically, this amounts to expanding the functions fH|2, fH|1 and fH|0 around β = 0
and picking up the term proportional to β5, β3 and β, respectively. Note that the residue
vanishes for any even functions fH|n(β) , which is guarantied when the character χH itself
is even in β . In the end, the one-loop vacuum energy of the AdS5 theory with the spectrum
H is given by the sum of three coeﬃcients as

To summarize, the one-loop vacuum energy can be obtained from

Γ(1) ren

(5.30)

Prescription 1 Extracting β2n+1 coeﬃcients of the functions fH|n

Prescription 2 The integral (5.27) with an analytic continuation on z

Prescription 3 The contour integral (5.28)

These three prescriptions are equivalent as far as the functions fH|n free from any singularity
around positive real β axis except for the pole at β = 0 . This is the case for any one particle
state in AdS5 , as well as for the spectrum of Vasiliev’s theory. However, we will see that it
is no more true for the AdS dual to a matrix model CFT. We shall come back to this issue
after considering a few examples: the vector models as the ﬁrst example, then the sample
calculations for the spectra of the second and third Regge trajectories (that correspond to
the CFT operators involving three and four ﬁelds φ, respectively). For a better illustration,
we will consider both the exact evaluation of the β integral keeping the z dependence and
the residue results (5.29) and (5.30).

5.3 Test with Vector Models

In order to test the result in the previous section, we compute the zeta function of the
non-minimal/minimal Vasiliev theory, dual to free U (N )/O(N ) model CFT.

Let us ﬁrst consider the non-minimal Vasiliev theory, whose spectrum corresponds to
the tensor product of two Rac representation. The character of Rac obtained in (2.50) can
be written in terms of (β, α1, α2) variables as

χRac(β, α1, α2) =

sinh β

2 (cosh β − cos α1) (cosh β − cos α2)

,

(5.31)

hence the character of the non-minimal model is

χnon-min(β, α1, α2) = [χRac(β, α1, α2)]2 =

sinh2 β

4 (cosh β − cos α1)2 (cosh β − cos α2)2 .

(5.32)

One can ﬁrst notice that the above character is even in β hence the residues (5.29) vanish
implying that the one-loop vacuum energy vanishes. We may nevertheless proceed to

– 37 –

evaluate the zeta function for more concrete understanding. For the evaluation of the zeta
function, we need to ﬁrst calculate the corresponding fnon-min|n(β) functions. They are
given by

fnon-min|2(β) =

coth2 β

32

,

fnon-min|1(β) =

coth2 β
2

48 −

coth2 β
2
24 sinh2 β
2

,

fnon-min|0(β) = 0 .

(5.33)
With these we can obtain ζnon-min|n(z)’s by performing Mellin transforms as (5.21). How-
ever, the integral is divergent for large β for a z which regularizes the small β divergence.
Actually this large β divergence is due to the contribution of D(2, 0) which is the lightest
scalar ﬁeld in AdS5 in the spectrum. The latter has already ill-deﬁned zeta function at the
level of (5.10). One can regularize this divergence by increasing its mass by inﬁnitesimally
small amount as in [7]. This can be realized by replacing the ∆ value from 2 to 2 + ǫ , and
it amounts to inserting a e−ǫ β term in the β integral. In this scheme, we get

where we used the integration method of Appendix C. In the z → 0 limit, the ratios
of gamma functions in the right hand side are ﬁnite whereas the zeta functions vanish:
ζ(−6) = ζ(−4) = 0 . Hence, we can verify that the one-loop vacuum energy vanishes.
Alternatively, we can use Laurent expansion of fnon-min|n with the variable q ≡ e−β. By
this, we can check that the quantities γnon-min|n deﬁned in (5.29) individually vanish for
n = 0, 1, 2 (since the functions are even in β). This result again verify the vanishing of the
one-loop vacuum energy.

We next consider the minimal Vasiliev theory with only even spins. The correspond-
ing character is given again in terms of χRac as (4.28). Since the χ2
Rac = χnon-min gives
trivial vacuum energy, the only non-trivial contribution may come from the second term
χRac(2β, 2α1, 2α2)/2 = χmin(β, α1, α2)−χnon-min(β, α1, α2)/2 =: χR(β, α1, α2) . After some
manipulation, one get

whose sum again gives 1/90. Therefore, the examples of vector models show the agreement.
We will now compare the above result with Γ(1) ren
, the one-loop vacuum energy associated
to the Rac representation in AdS5. This does not represent a propagating degree of freedom
in the bulk. Nonetheless, we can formally deﬁne and evaluate a one-loop determinant
corresponding to this ﬁeld. We will ﬁnd that the answer correctly reproduces the a-anomaly
of the conformal scalar on the boundary. See [13] for related discussions. We also remark
here that this result will be useful for computing the one-loop vacuum energy of the AdS
dual of the free SU (N ) adjoint scalar ﬁeld theory as well. Again, we ﬁrst calculate the
functions fRac|n and get

fRac|2(β) =

fRac|1(β) =

(5.40)

where we have again regularized the divergence coming from large β region by introducing
a e−ǫ β damping factor. This divergence arises because the conformal weight is smaller than
2. By expanding the zeta function around z = 0 , one can show that it gives the same value

– 39 –

as the vacuum energy of the conformal scalar on the boundary. Once again, the ﬁnite part
of the vacuum energy can be directly extracted by expanding (5.39) around β = 0 , and we
immediately get

Interestingly again, as mentioned at the outset, the IR log divergence of ζRac gives the UV

5.4 Vacuum Energy for the AdS Dual of SU (N ) Adjoint Model

We now turn to the main result of the paper, one-loop vacuum energy computation of
the AdS5 theory which is dual to the free SU (N ) adjoint scalar CFT on S4. We ﬁrst
compute the vacuum energy of the ﬁelds in the ﬁrst few Regge trajectories using the
method of residues, following the prescription (5.29). We present a trend of the vacuum
energy growth by the power of the ﬁelds φ , exhibited in Fig. 3. Next, we will take the limit
N → ∞, and compute the one-loop vacuum energy for the corresponding theory. This
indicates a non-trivial shift in the relation between the bulk dimensionless coupling g and
the boundary parameter N .

5.4.1 Vacuum Energies for a Few Low Orders

We ﬁrst carry out the determination of the one-loop vacuum energy of the ﬁelds in the
ﬁrst few Regge trajectories using the method of residues. We have explicitly evaluated and
exhibited the contributions of terms up to order 4 in the ﬁelds φ and results up to order 32
are then displayed graphically. While the overall pattern for the one-loop vacuum energy
is chaotic, and indeed non-monotonic as well, we do observe the trend that the vacuum
energies corresponding to n = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 are exactly 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 times of the n = 1 case,
respectively. We start with the order two contribution.

Order Two The order two spectrum coincides with that of minimal Vasiliev theory,
hence the vacuum energy is equal to that of Rac:

Γ(1) ren
cyc2 =

log R
90 ≃ 0.0111111 log R .

(5.43)

Order Three The order three cyclic character is given analogously to (4.36). From that,
we ﬁrst calculate fcyc3|n(β)’s and their residues,

γcyc3|2 =

7627
475200

,

γcyc3|1 =

46483
3991680

,

γcyc3|0 = −

3071
561330

.

By summing the above, we get

Γ(1) ren
cyc3 =

362911
16329600

log R =≃ 0.0222241 log R ,

which is roughly twice of the order two contribution.

(5.44)

(5.45)

– 40 –

Order Four The order four cyclic character is given analogously to (4.39), and we obtain
similarly the residues,

γcyc4|2 =

253
15360

,

γcyc4|1 =

125
9216

,

γcyc4|0 = −

.

whose sum simpliﬁes ending up with

Γ(1) ren
cyc3 =

log R
45 ≃ 0.0222222 log R .

(5.46)

(5.47)

Interestingly, the order four contribution is exactly twice of the contribution of Rac or the
order two. We can see that the vacuum energies do not increase monotonically as the order
four part is slightly smaller than the order three one.

Higher Orders
In order to have a better idea, we can proceed to calculate the higher
order contributions to the vacuum energy. Fig. 3 shows the values of the vacuum energies
for the ﬁelds corresponding to χcycn up to the order n = 32. As we have commented

Figure 3. Vacuum energies of AdS5 ﬁelds in diﬀerent orders

previously, the energies show an approximate linear growth with some chaotic oscillations.
Additionally, the vacuum energies corresponding to n = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 are exactly 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
times of the n = 1 case, respectively. It would be interesting to investigate this pattern
further.

5.4.2 Vacuum Energy in Diﬀerent Slices

When the rank of the gauge group becomes inﬁnite, the character encoding the set of
all single trace operators in the CFT can be simpliﬁed to obtain an expression in terms
of the Euler totient function, given in the second equality of (2.84), reproduced here for
convenience:

χadj = −χRac +

ϕ(k)

k

χlog,k .

(5.48)

∞

Xk=1

– 41 –

The χlog,k are given in the AdS5 case by

χlog,k(β, α1, α2) = − log[1 − χRac(k β, k α1, k α2)] .

(5.49)

The ﬁrst term in (5.48) subtracts the single ﬁeld contribution from the rest, and its contri-
bution to the vacuum energy has been calculated in (5.42). We will therefore focus on the
logarithmic term (5.49) which is new. As we already argued in the AdS4 case, carrying out
this computation while summing over all k leads to an inﬁnite number of singular points
in the β place, clustering around β = 0, making the partition function highly non-analytic.
Therefore to carry out this computation in a well-deﬁned way, we need to work at a ﬁxed
k, compute the one-loop vacuum energy contribution, and then sum over all diﬀerent k
contributions with the weight ϕ(k)/k . For these reasons, from now on let us focus on χlog,k
(5.49) and calculate the corresponding contribution to the vacuum energy Γ(1) ren
log,k . For that,
we need to ﬁrst identify the functions flog,k|n(β) . After some compuations, we get

flog,k|2(β) =

(5.50)

The next step is the identiﬁcation of γlog,k|n with (5.29). Note that the issue of diﬀerent
prescriptions enters here. As one can see, the function flog,k|n(β) do have additional branch
cuts on the positive real axis of β . In fact, such singularities precisely coincide with the
Hagedorn phase transition which appears at the thermal AdS partition function, where we
interpret the integration variable β as the inverse temperature. In our work, we are focusing
on the AdS space with sphere boundary hence there is no notion of temperature a priori.
Nevertheless, the technical simpliﬁcation of the vacuum energy calls for the use of the full
character. This can be physically interpreted as the generalized partition function, which
does see the Hagedorn transition at the speciﬁc point β = βH. We emphasize again the β
does not carry a thermal/geometric meaning on the boundary/bulk of the AdS space, but
simply enters to address properly the spectrum of the theory in consideration. As we have
shown before, the one-loop vacuum energy is given through the integral of such partition
function and the singularity arising at βH introduces an ambiguity of the prescription.
In other words, as we have seen from the computation of the vacuum energy of a ﬁxed
Regge trajectory, the vacuum energy increases as the order of φ in the dual CFT operator
increases. Hence, the full one-loop vacuum energy will be given as a divergent series. This
divergence, arising while summing over inﬁnitely many trajectories, is not automatically
regularized by the introduction of the UV regulator z as in the Vasiliev’s model case, but

– 42 –

requires a new regularization prescription. This shows a clear diﬀerence between Vasiliev’s
theory (dual to vector models) and stringy AdS theory (dual to matrix models).

The necessity of introducing a new regularization method is translated here to the
choice of prescription among three possibilities proposed in Section 5.2. Let us examine
the three prescriptions, one by one, for the AdS theory dual to the SU (N ) adjoint model.

Prescription 1

The prescription 1 is the simplest option and has well deﬁned meaning even for the functions
flog,k|n(β):
it is suﬃcient to expand the functions flog,k|n(β) around the β = 0 point.
Considering ﬁrst flog,k|2(β), one can show that the β5 coeﬃcient is absent:

and can verify that they miss the β3 and β coeﬃcients, respectively. Hence, γlog,k|1 =
γlog,k|0 = 0 , and in this prescrition, we are led to conclude that the one-loop vacuum
energy for a ﬁxed slice vanishes.

Prescription 2

The prescription 2 is the integral along the postive real axis of β . This integral is convergent
only for large enough z hence requires an analytic continuation on z . In the following, we
sketch how we can carry out the computation of such integral for ζlog,k|2(z). We ﬁrst recast
the integral into

Γ(z) ζlog,k|2(z)

(2k)5−2z Γ(2z − 5)

log R
× [Ψk(p1, 2z − 5) + Ψk(p2, 2z − 5) + Ψk(p3, 2z − 5) − 3 Ψk(1, 2z − 5)] , (5.54)

by introducing

Ψk(p, z) = 6 ˜Φ(p, z, 0) − 4 ˜Φ(p, z,− 1

and for the other region by analytic continuations. The p1, p2 and p3 are deﬁned through
the factorization17,

1 − 4 q + 2 q2 − q3 = (1 − p1 q) (1 − p2 q) (1 − p3 q) .

For Re(z) > 1 and p 6= 1 , the integral (5.56) is equivalent to the contour integral,

˜Φ(p, z, a) =

with the contour depicted in Fig. 2. The above is again well-deﬁned for any value of z ,
hence one can immediately put z = −5 and consider the residue at the origin. This way,
we obtain

Note that the above result can be applied to p = p1, p2 and p3 but not to p = 1 , as one
can check that (5.59) diverges in the latter case. This means that Prescription 2 does not
give a ﬁnite value for ζ ′
log,k|2(0) even after an analytic continuation on z . To proceed, we
need to properly extract a ﬁnite part from Ψk(1,−5). The shift of the branch point at the
origin to β = −ǫ corresponds to the replacement of Ψk(1,−5) by
+ O(ǫ)(cid:19) .

(5.61)

Using (5.57) one can show that the above four terms exactly cancel each others implying
ζ ′
log,k|2(0) = 0 . Let us remark that the regularization (5.60) is equivalent to taking only the
β5 term from the integrand of (5.56) for the residue and ignoring the presence of the branch
cut. Therefore, Prescription 2 with the regularization (5.60) is equivalent to Prescription 1.
For ζlog,k|1 and ζlog,k|0 , one can do similar analysis and show their ﬁrst derivatives vanish
at z = 0. See Appendix C for more details.

Let us focus on the result obtained in Prescription 1 and 2 and provide some inter-
pretation. As all three contributions γlog,k|2, γlog,k|1 and γlog,k|0 vanish. Hence, we can
conclude that the k-th contribution to the vacuum energy vanishes according to (5.30):

log,k = 0 .

where q = e−β. Factorizing the numerator as in eq. (5.57) enables us to replace log(cid:20)1 −
log(cid:0)1 − p1 qk(cid:1) + log(cid:0)1 − p2 qk(cid:1) + log(cid:0)1 − p3 qk(cid:1) − 3 log(cid:0)1 − qk(cid:1), from which we obtain decompositions like

eq. (5.54). See Appendix C for details.

where L0 = S0/VolAdS5 is the classical Lagrangian evaluated on the AdS5 vacuum solution
(see (3.13)), and g is the dimensionless coupling constant deﬁned in (3.9). From the
AdS/CFT correspondence, the free energy FCFT4 of boundary scalar ﬁeld theory should
be identiﬁed to the ΓAdS5. The free energy of conformal SU (N ) matrix scalar on the S4
has a logarithmic divergence corresponding to the conformal a-anomaly [95, 96],

FCFT4 =

we get

As in the vector model cases [6–8], this formula suggests the relations,

g = N 2 ,

L0 =

It may be worth to note that the second equation is compatible with the vector model cases,
assuming that the matter sectors do not contribute to the Lagrangian value L0. This is a
reasonable assumption from ordinary ﬁeld theory point of view because only gravity can
have a non-trivial background value.

Prescription 3

Finally in the prescription 3, we have to consider a contour which encircles all the singu-
larities of the integrand. In particular, the logarithm function,

log"1 −

sinh(kβ)

(5.68)

generates the branch cuts which is depicted in Fig. 4. With the evaluation z = 0 , the
branch cut of (−β)2(z−1−n) along the positive real axis of β disappears, and the remaining
singularities are composed of the branch cuts in Fig. 4 and the poles at the end points of
the cuts.

Hence we can consider the contour of Fig. 5. Such integral will give a ﬁnite and non-
trivial result for a ﬁxed slice k . Once the integral is evaluated, we can sum them for all
k according to (5.48) to get the full vacuum energy. However, in this paper we do not
evaluate them as we could not ﬁnd any analytic measure to do so. Instead, in order to

see the relation of Prescrition 3 to the others, let us consider a deformation of the branch
points at β = 0 while keeping all the poles untouched. The original integral can now be
split into four pieces as in Fig. 6. After evaluating the four contour integrals separately, we
can eventually take the limit that the shifted branch points tend back to the origin. Each
of four contributions diverges in the latter limit, while their sum is ﬁnite. In this set-up,
Prescription 1 would correspond to taking the ﬁnite part of the contour around the origin
but discarding all other contributions.

6 Conclusion

Let us brieﬂy summarize the objectives and the results obtained in this paper. The physics
we attempted to explore is the holography of the free SU (N ) adjoint scalar CFT in the
N → ∞ limit. We assume this theory to admit an AdS dual, an extension of Vasiliev’s
theory with inﬁnitely many higher spin massive multiplets. This theory can be considered
as a toy model for more realistic and/or interesting stringy models. The ﬁeld content of
the AdS theory is to match with the spectrum of single trace operators in the CFT. This is
a necessary condition for formulating a meaningful AdS/CFT duality in all known cases.
The main aspect of this holography that we investigated is the one-loop correction of the
AdS theory which ought to correspond to the ﬁrst 1/N correction of the CFT. Since the
CFT is free, the latter correction vanishes implying the triviality of the AdS one-loop eﬀect.
The one-loop triviality of AdS theory is a highly non-trivial property as an inﬁnite
number of contributions from each ﬁeld contents should sum up to cancel precisely.
In
order to test this property, we ﬁrst analyzed the single trace operator content of the CFT
by decomposing tensor product of the singleton representation which accounts the degrees
of freedom of free conformal scalar. Explicit decompositions were carried out for the three
and four tensor products in the three dimensional CFT, and in principle the analysis is
extendable to other dimensions and higher powers as well. We found that the decomposition
rules increase in complexity as higher powers of singletons are considered, but in every case
explicit closed form expressions can be obtained.

Next, we turn to the simplest one-loop eﬀect, the vacuum energy of the AdS theory.
Using the explicit results obtained for the spectrum of single trace operators, we compute
the vacuum energies of the AdS ﬁelds in a ﬁrst few Regge trajectories. However, this
method quickly becomes prohibitive both due to increasing complexity of the spectrum
and the careful regularization required at various steps in the calculation.

We therefore developed a new formalism for writing down the zeta function, exploiting
the fact that the character of the singleton encodes the spectrum of single trace operators.

– 47 –

This formalism greatly simpliﬁes computations of the one-loop vacuum energies. In the
case of AdS4, it allowed us to calculate the vacuum energies for the ﬁrst 8 trajectory
ﬁelds. In the case of AdS5, the integral involved becomes even simpler, hence we could
calculate the vacuum energies for the ﬁrst 32 trajectories. In both cases, the calculation
of vacuum energy for any ﬁxed trajectory can be done in principle, but requires more
computing powers for higher trajectories. An analytic expression of the vacuum energy
for an arbitrary level is nevertheless unavailable.
It is partly due to the fact that the
corresponding character involves the number theoretic Euler totient function.

In order to avoid the diﬃculty related to the Euler totient function, we consider the
diﬀerent summation (or slice) for the full vacuum energy which is valid only in the N → ∞
limit. At this point, it might be worth to remark that the integral and series that we
are considering — PnR dβ or PkR dβ — is all the time ‘two-dimensional’. This is to be

compared with the two-dimensional fundamental domain of torus appearing in the string
loop:

N∆,ℓ

X∆,ℓ

∆,ℓ

= Xn or kZ dβ (··· ) =

.

(6.1)

With the new slice, the AdS4 vacuum energy for a given slice is given by an integral,
which could be evaluated only by a numerical method (see Appendix B). Turning to AdS5
case, we note ﬁrst that the derivation of the vacuum energy from the character is no more
unique for AdS duals of matrix model CFTs. We considered three prescriptions which
become equivalent for a single particle state in AdS5, but diﬀer from each other for the
matrix model case.

In the ﬁrst prescription, we ﬁnd that the vacuum energy exactly vanishes for each
slice. This result can be equally obtained in the second prescription upon introducing an
addition regularization. Hence, the one-loop vacuum energy of the AdS5 theory dual to the
free SU (N ) adjoint scalar CFT on S4 coincides with minus of the free energy of a boundary
scalar. This is somewhat analogous to the duality between the minimal Vasiliev theory
and the free O(N ) vector model, hence suggests that the loop-expansion parameter in the
AdS5 theory should be identiﬁed to N 2 rather than N 2 − 1 , the dimension of SU (N ).

In the last prescription, the vacuum energy for a ﬁxed slice is given by a contour integral
surrounding the singularities. The latter contains not only poles but also branch cuts,
which are generated by the logarithm arising as a result of summing over trajectories. These
singularities are precisely where the Hagedorn phase transition takes place. The appearance
of such singularities and the possibility of their relevance to one-loop vacuum energy is
interesting but also intriguing, because the parameter β is not a physical temperature
for the CFT in our case. Rather it is just a parameter which is being used to count
the number of the spectrum of the theory, and in this sense one might not expect the
Hagedorn transition to play a role in the vacuum energy. In this work, for the technical
reason, we have not explore suﬃciently the contributions coming from the Hagedorn-related
singularities. We hope to revisit this issue in near feature. One interesting direction in this
respect would be the computation of the vacuum energy in the thermal AdS5 with S3 × S1

– 48 –

boundary, where the Hagedorn transition has a physical meaning. We hope to report soon
about the latter computation.

Finally, the results contained in this paper can be extended in many directions. The
most interesting one would be to apply these tests to explore the duality of tensionless string
theory to free CFTs, e.g. the duality between the Type IIB string theory on AdS5× S5 and
the N = 4 Super Yang-Mills (SYM) with the gauge group SU (N ). The planar (N → ∞)
and free (g2
Y M N → 0) limit of this theory should correspond in the bulk to the tensionless
limit of Type IIB string theory. While this phase of string theory is still fairly poorly
understood, one may use the boundary CFT data available to us as a means of getting
some insight into the bulk physics [19, 20, 22–24]. In particular, one may expect to identify
the ﬁeld content of the bulk theory from the operator spectrum of the dual CFT, and carry
out the checks we have done in this paper.

Additionally, for technical reasons we mainly focused on free ﬁeld theories whose oper-
ator spectrum is completely classiﬁed by taking tensor products of the singleton represen-
tation. However, our methods allow us in principle to compute the one-loop vacuum energy
for the bulk dual of any theory whose planar operator spectrum is known. These include
the Chern-Simons with Matter theories of [97, 98] and the interacting theories obtained by
ﬂowing to Wilson-Fisher ﬁxed points by turning on double-trace deformations for the free
theory, much as in the case of vector models. These, and related questions, are work in
progress and we hope to report on them soon.

character in (na, nb) representation is given by

χ(na,nb) = (hna − hna−2)(hnb − hnb−4) − (hna+1 − hna−3)(hnb−1 − hnb−3) ,

B AdS4 Zeta Function

B.1 Modiﬁed Zeta Function Regularization

As we are only interested in the zeta function up to order z in the small z expansion, it
is suﬃcient to check that the ζ∆,s(z) and ˜ζ∆,s(z) agree up to order z2. To carry out this
check, it is more convenient to work with y = cos α instead of α itself. The character of
V(∆, s) may be rewritten as

where the contour encircles the β = 0 point. Hence, one can simply adjust the formula
(4.24) by (B.13). One can notice that the diﬀerence term vanishes when the character χH
is even function of β .

B.2 Numerical Approach to Small β Cut-Oﬀ Regularization
In Section 4, we noted the diﬃculty of the analytic computation of ˜ζlog,k(z) . We can
proceed numerically by change the regularization scheme from zeta function one to short
β cut-oﬀ one:

Z ∞

0

dβ β2z f (β) → Z ∞

ǫ

dβ f (β) ,

(B.14)

where we simply remove all the divergence arising in the limit ǫ → 0 . The absence of
˜ζlog,k(0) can be veriﬁed in the new scheme from the absence of 1/β term of the integrand
f (β) . Thanks to this, the splitting of f (β) into the regular and singular parts is unam-
biguous. Truncating the integrand only to the regular part, the ǫ → 0 limit of the integral
become well-deﬁned and can be evaluated numerically. The plot in Fig. 7 shows the nu-
merical values of the Γ(1) ren
log,k contributions for k = 1, 2, . . . , 100. It shows an approximate
linear growth with a very small perturbations:

C AdS5 Zeta Function

The zeta functions are given by β-integrals whose z-dependence regularizes the pole of the
integrand at β = 0 . Upon analytic continuations in z, the zeta functions give the vacuum
energies by their ﬁrst derivatives at z = 0 . The typical way to evaluate these β-integrals
is by partial fraction decomposition of the integrand in q = e−β and by using the integral

C.1 Zeta Function of the Vector Model

In this section we will present the detailed computations for the vacuum energy for the
non–minimal and minimal Vasiliev theories in AdS5, outlined respectively in (5.34) and
(5.36). Let us consider ﬁrst the zeta function for the non-minimal theory given by the ﬁrst
line of (5.34). We ﬁrst rewrite the integrand as a rational function of q = e−β , then do the
partial fraction decomposition:

Thus, via the partial fraction decomposition above, the β integrals have reduced integral

at p = 1. We next use (C.2), and the identity Φ(1, z, a) = ζ(z, a) to show that

Again, using the the partial fraction expansion for the integrand, we could express all the
β integrals in terms of the Lerch function and its derivatives, and eventually the Hurwitz
zeta function. On further simpliﬁcation, we obtained the third line of (5.36).

C.2 Zeta Function for the Matrix Model

For the evaluation of the zeta function of the AdS theory dual to the free SU (N ) adjoint
scalar CFT, we need to perform the integrals (5.21) with flog,k|n as deﬁned in (5.50) to
arrive at the quantities ζlog,k|n. We will show that these contributions to the zeta function
vanish up to linear order in the small z expansion. Let us ﬁrst focus on the integration of
the flog,k|2. The corresponding integral expression is given by

(C.12)

The above expression can be recast into (5.54) using (5.55) and (5.56), and evaluated using
the contour integral (5.58).

While it is possible to evaluate the remaining contributions to the zeta function from
flog,k|1 and flog,k|0 in this manner, we shall provide an additional means to do so. Consider
the following series expansion of the logarithmic function,

and interchanging the order of ℓ summation and β integration, the latter can be evaluated
to give

where Ψk was deﬁned in (5.55). Hence we recover (5.54). Note however that the series
(C.15) is not convergent since one of |pi| is greater than 1. Nevertheless, once the series is
evaluated in its domain of convergence, it may be extended to |pi| > 1 as well through its
representation in terms of ˜Φ. The small z expansion of this expression has already been

– 57 –

carried out in the main text and it was shown that the expression vanishes up to linear
order in z. That is,

ζ ′
log,k|2(0) = 0.

(C.16)

In fact, there exists a shorter way to draw the same conclusion relying on an ad-hoc
regularization prescription. Since we are interested in the zeta function up to linear order
in z, it is easy to see that

For the sake of simplicity, in the computations of ζ ′

the above prescription in the rest of this section. We begin with the evaluation of ζlog,k|1:
