Abstract. In this paper we generalize the axiom systems given by M. Pa lasi´nski, B. Wo´zniakowska
and by W.H. Cornish for commutative BCK-algebras to the case of commutative pseudo BCK-
algebras. A characterization of commutative pseudo BCK-algebras is also given. We deﬁne
the commutative deductive systems of pseudo BCK-algebras and we generalize some results
proved by Yisheng Huang for commutative ideals of BCI-algebras to the case of commuta-
tive deductive systems of pseudo BCK-algebras. We prove that a pseudo BCK-algebra A is
commutative if and only if all the deductive systems of A are commutative. We show that a
normal deductive system H of a pseudo BCK-algebra A is commutative if and only if A/H is
a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra. We introduce the notions of state operators and state-
morphism operators on pseudo BCK-algebras, and we apply these results on commutative
deductive systems to investigate the properties of these operators.

1. Introduction

BCK-algebras were introduced by Y. Imai and K. Is`eki in 1966 ([22],[24]) as algebras with
a binary operation ∗ modeling the set-theoretical diﬀerence and with a constant element 0
that is a least element. Another motivation is from classical and non-classical propositional
calculi modeling logical implications. Such algebras contain as a special subfamily the family
of MV-algebras where important fuzzy structures can be studied. In 1975, S. Tanaka deﬁned
a special class of BCK-algebras called commutative BCK-algebras ([35]). H. Yutani was the
ﬁrst to give an equational base for commutative BCK-algebras ([38],[39]). An axiom system
for commutative BCK-algebras consisting of three identities was given by M. Pa lasi´nski and
B. Wo´zniakowska in [32], while W.H. Cornish gave in [10] an axiom system for commutative
BCK-algebras consisting of two identities. For more details about BCK-algebras, see [14],
[30]. Commutative ideals in BCK-algebras were introduced in [29], and they were general-
ized in [28] and [34] for the case of BCI-algebras and BE-algebras, respectively. This class
of ideals proved to play an important role in the study of state BCK-algebras and state-
morphism BCK-algebras (see [2]). Pseudo BCK-algebras were introduced by G. Georgescu
and A. Iorgulescu in [19] as algebras with ”two diﬀerences”, a left- and right-diﬀerence, instead
of one ∗ and with a constant element 0 as the least element. Nowadays pseudo BCK-algebras
are used in a dual form, with two implications, → and   and with one constant element
1, that is the greatest element. Thus such pseudo BCK-algebras are in the ”negative cone”
and are also called ”left-ones”. Commutative pseudo BCK-algebras were originally deﬁned by
G. Georgescu and A. Iorgulescu in [19] under the name of semilattice-ordered pseudo BCK-
algebras and properties of these structures were investigated by J. K¨uhr in [25], [26]. An
axiom system for bounded commutative pseudo BCK-algebras was presented by Walendziak

in [36]. Introduced by W. Dudek and Y.B. Jun ([13]), pseudo BCI-algebras are pseudo BCK-
algebras having no greatest element. According to [40], commutative pseudo BCI-algebras
and commutative pseudo BCI-ﬁlters were deﬁned and studied in [27]. Pseudo BE-algebras
were introduced in [1] as generalizations of BE-algebras, and the commutative pseudo BE-
algebras have recently been investigated in [8]. In 1995, D. Mundici introduced an analogue
of the probability measure on MV-algebras, called a state ([31]), as the averaging process
for formulas in  Lukasiewicz logic. After that, the states on other many-valued logic algebras
have been intensively studied. Flaminio and Montagna were the ﬁrst to present a uniﬁed ap-
proach to states and probabilistic many-valued logic in a logical and algebraic setting ([18]).
They added a unary operation, called internal state or state operator to the language of MV-
algebras which preserves the usual properties of states. A more powerful type of logic can be
given by algebraic structures with internal states, and they are also very interesting varieties
of universal algebras. Di Nola and Dvureˇcenskij introduced the notion of a state-morphism
MV-algebra which is a stronger variation of a state MV-algebra ([11], [12]). The notion of a
state operator was extended by Rach˚unek and ˇSalounov´a in [33] for the case of GMV-algebras
(pseudo MV-algebras). State operators and state-morphism operators on BL-algebras were
introduced and investigated in [4] and subdirectly irreducible state-morphism BL-algebras
were studied in [15]. Dvureˇcenskij, Rach˚unek and ˇSalounov´a introduced state Rℓ-monoids
and state-morphism Rℓ-monoids ([16],[17]), while the state operators on pseudo BL-algebras
and bounded pseudo-hoops have been investigated in [9] and in [5],[7], respectively. Recently,
the state BCK-algebras and state-morphism BCK-algebras were deﬁned and studied in [2].
In this paper we generalize to the case of commutative pseudo BCK-algebras the axiom sys-
tems given by M. Pa lasi´nski and B. Wo´zniakowska in [32] and by W.H. Cornish in [10] for
commutative BCK-algebras. A characterization of commutative pseudo BCK-algebras is also
given. We deﬁne the commutative deductive systems of pseudo BCK-algebras and we inves-
tigate their properties by generalizing some results proved in [21] for the case of commutative
ideals of BCI-algebras. We prove that a pseudo BCK-algebra A is commutative if and only
if all the deductive systems of A are commutative. We show that a normal deductive system
H of a pseudo BCK-algebra A is commutative if and only if A/H is a commutative pseudo
BCK-algebra. Inspired from [2], we introduce the notions of state operators of type I and type
II and state-morphism operators on pseudo BCK-algebras, and we apply the above mentioned
results to investigate the properties of these operators. We show that the kernel of a type II
state operator is a commutative deductive system. We deﬁne the notion of a normal state
operator, proving that any type I or type II state operator on a commutative pseudo BCK-
algebra is normal. It is proved that any normal type II state operator is a normal type I state
operator, while a normal type I state operator is a normal type II state operator if its kernel
is a commutative deductive system. In the last section we introduce and study the notion of
a state-morphism operator on a pseudo BCK-algebra, showing that any normal type II state
operator on a linearly ordered pseudo BCK-algebra is a state-morphism. For the case of a
linearly ordered commutative pseudo BCK-algebra, we prove that any type I state operator
is also a state-morphism operator.

2. Preliminaries on pseudo BCK-algebras

A pseudo BCK-algebra (more precisely, reversed left-pseudo BCK-algebra) is a structure
A = (A, ≤, →,  , 1) where ≤ is a binary relation on A, → and   are binary operations on A
and 1 is an element of A satisfying, for all x, y, z ∈ A, the axioms:
(psBCK1) x → y ≤ (y → z)   (x → z),
(psBCK2) x ≤ (x → y)   y, x ≤ (x   y) → y;
(psBCK3) x ≤ x;

x   y ≤ (y   z) → (x   z);

(psBCK4) x ≤ 1;
(psBCK5) if x ≤ y and y ≤ x then x = y;
(psBCK6) x ≤ y iﬀ x → y = 1 iﬀ x   y = 1.

Since the partial order ≤ is determined by any of the two “arrows”, we can eliminate “≤”

from the signature and denote a pseudo BCK-algebra by A = (A, →,  , 1).
An equivalent deﬁnition of a pseudo BCK-algebra is given in [25].
The structure A = (A, →,  , 1) of the type (2, 2, 0) is a pseudo BCK-algebra iﬀ it satisﬁes the
following identities and quasi-identity, for all x, y, z ∈ A:
(psBCK ′
(psBCK ′
(psBCK ′
(psBCK ′
(psBCK ′
(psBCK ′
The partial order ≤ is deﬁned by x ≤ y iﬀ x → y = 1 (iﬀ x   y = 1).
If the poset (A, ≤) is a meet-semilattice then A is called a pseudo BCK-meet-semilattice and
we denote it by A = (A, ∧, →,  , 1). If (A, ≤) is a lattice then we will say that A is a pseudo
BCK-lattice and it is denoted by A = (A, ∧, ∨, →,  , 1).

1) (x → y)   [(y → z)   (x → z)] = 1;
2) (x   y) → [(y   z) → (x   z)] = 1;
3) 1 → x = x;
4) 1   x = x;
5) x → 1 = 1;
6) (x → y = 1 and y → x = 1) implies x = y.

A pseudo BCK-algebra A = (A, →,  , 1) with a constant a ∈ A (which can denote any

element) is called a pointed pseudo BCK-algebra.
A pointed pseudo BCK-algebra is denoted by A = (A, →,  , a, 1).

A pseudo BCK-algebra A is called bounded if there exists an element 0 ∈ A such that 0 ≤ x
for all x ∈ A. In a bounded pseudo BCK-algebra (A, →,  , 0, 1) we can deﬁne two negations:
x→0 = x → 0 and x 0 = x   0. A bounded pseudo BCK-algebra A is called good if it satisﬁes
the identity x→0 0 = x 0→0 for all x ∈ A.
An algebra (A, ≤, →,  , 1) satisfying (psBCK1), (psBCK2), (psBCK3), (psBCK5), (psBCK6)
(or equivalently (psBCK ′

Lemma 2.1. ([19]) In any pseudo BCK-algebra (A, →,  , 1) the following hold for all x, y, z ∈
A:
(1) x ≤ y implies z → x ≤ z → y and z   x ≤ z   y;
(2) x ≤ y implies y → z ≤ x → z and y   z ≤ x   z;
(3) x → y ≤ (z → x) → (z → y) and x   y ≤ (z   x)   (z   y);
(4) x → (y   z) = y   (x → z) and x   (y → z) = y → (x   z);
(5) x ≤ y → x and x ≤ y   x;
(6) ((x → y)   y) → y = x → y and ((x   y) → y)   y = x   y.

For more details about the properties of a pseudo BCK-algebra we refer te reader to [23]

and [6].
Let A be a pseudo BCK-algebra. The subset D ⊆ A is called a deductive system of A if it
satisﬁes the following conditions:
(i) 1 ∈ D;
(ii) for all x, y ∈ A, if x, x → y ∈ D then y ∈ D.
Condition (ii) is equivalent to the condition:
(ii′) for all x, y ∈ B, if x, x   y ∈ D then y ∈ D.
A deductive system D of a pseudo BCK-algebra A is said to be normal
condition:
(iii) for all x, y ∈ A, x → y ∈ D iﬀ x   y ∈ D.
We will denote by DS(A) the set of all deductive systems and by DSn(A) the set of all
normal deductive systems of a pseudo BCK-algebra A. Obviously {1}, A ∈ DS(A), DS n(A)

if it satisﬁes the

COMMUTATIVE DEDUCTIVE SYSTEMS OF PSEUDO BCK-ALGEBRAS

4

and DSn(A) ⊆ DS(A). A pseudo BCK-algebra is called simple if DS(A) = {{1}, A}.
Given H ∈ DSn(A), the relation ΘH on A deﬁned by (x, y) ∈ ΘH iﬀ x → y ∈ H and
y → x ∈ H is a congruence on A. Then H = [1]ΘH and A/H = (A/ΘH , →,  , [1]ΘH ) is a
pseudo BCK-algebra and we write x/H = [x]ΘH for every x ∈ A (see [25]).
The function πH : A −→ A/H deﬁned by πH(x) = x/H for any x ∈ A is a surjective
homomorphism which is called the canonical projection from A to A/H. One can easily prove
that Ker (πH ) = H.
For every subset X ⊆ A, the smallest deductive system of A containing X (i.e. the intersection
of all deductive systems D ∈ DS(A) such that X ⊆ D) is called the deductive system generated
by X, and it will be denoted by [X). If X = {x} we write [x) instead of [{x}).
For all x, y ∈ A and n ∈ N we deﬁne x →n y and x  n y inductively as follows:

x →0 y = y, x →n y = x → (x →n−1 y) for n ≥ 1;
x  0 y = y, x  n y = x   (x  n−1 y) for n ≥ 1.

Pseudo BE-algebras were introduced in [1] as another generalization of pseudo BCK-algebras.
A pseudo BE-algebra is an algebra (A, →,  , 1) of the type (2, 2, 0) such that the following
axioms hold for all x, y, z ∈ A:
(psBE1) x → x = x   x = 1,
(psBE2) x → 1 = x   1 = 1,
(psBE3) 1 → x = 1   x = x,
(psBE4) x → (y   z) = y   (x → z),
(psBE5) x → y = 1 iﬀ x   y = 1.
It was proved in [8, Prop. 2.10] that any pseudo BCK-algebra is a pseudo BE-algebra.
A pseudo-hoop is an algebra (A, ⊙, →,  , 1) of the type (2, 2, 2, 0) such that for all x, y, z ∈ A:
(psH1) x ⊙ 1 = 1 ⊙ x = x;
(psH2) x → x = x   x = 1;
(psH3) (x ⊙ y) → z = x → (y → z);
(psH4) (x ⊙ y)   z = y   (x   z);
(psH5) (x → y) ⊙ x = (y → x) ⊙ y = x ⊙ (x   y) = y ⊙ (y   x).
A pseudo-hoop is a meet-semilattice with

x ∧ y = (x → y) ⊙ x = (y → x) ⊙ y = x ⊙ (x   y) = y ⊙ (y   x).

A pseudo-hoop (A, ⊙, →,  , 1) is said to be a Wajsberg pseudo-hoop if it satisﬁes the following
conditions for all x, y ∈ A:
(W1) (x → y)   y = (y → x)   x;
(W2) (x   y) → y = (y   x) → x.
A pseudo-hoop A is called basic if it satisﬁes the following conditions for all x, y, z ∈ A:
(B1) (x → y) → z ≤ ((y → x) → z) → z;
(B2) (x   y)   z ≤ ((y   x)   z)   z.
Every pseudo-hoop is a pseudo BCK-meet-semilattice ([6, Prop. 2.2]), every Wajsberg pseudo-
hoop is a basic pseudo-hoop ([20, Prop. 4.9]), and every simple basic pseudo-hoop is a linearly
ordered Wajsberg pseudo-hoop ([20, Cor. 4.15]).

3. On commutative pseudo BCK-algebras

Commutative pseudo BCK-algebras were originally deﬁned by G. Georgescu and A. Iorgulescu

in [19] under the name of semilattice-ordered pseudo BCK-algebras, while properties of these
structures were investigated by J. K¨uhr in [25], [26]. In this section we present some equa-
tional bases for commutative pseudo BCK-algebras. We ﬁrst recall the equational system
proved by J. K¨uhr in [26] as a generalization of the equational system given by H. Yutani in
[38], [39] for commutative BCK-algebras. We generalize to the case of commutative pseudo
BCK-algebras the axiom systems proved by M. Pa lasi´nski and B. Wo´zniakowska in [32] and

COMMUTATIVE DEDUCTIVE SYSTEMS OF PSEUDO BCK-ALGEBRAS

by W.H. Cornish in [10] for commutative BCK-algebras. A characterization of commutative
pseudo BCK-algebras is also given.

Deﬁnition 3.1. A pseudo BCK-algebra (A, →,  , 1) is said to be commutative if it satisﬁes
the following conditions, for all x, y ∈ A:

(x → y)   y = (y → x)   x,
(x   y) → y = (y   x) → x.

If (A, →,  , 1) is a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra then (A, ≤) is a join-semilattice,
where x ∨ y = (x → y)   y = (x   y) → y (see [19]). Conversely, if (A, ≤) is a join pseudo
BCK-semilattice with x ∨ y = (x → y)   y = (x   y) → y, from x ∨ y = y ∨ x, we have
(x → y)   y = (y → x)   x and (x   y) → y = (y   x) → x, for all x, y ∈ A, that is A is
commutative. We obtained the following result:

Proposition 3.2. A pseudo BCK-algebra A is commutative if and only if (A, ≤) is a join
semilattice with x ∨ y = (x → y)   y = (x   y) → y.

Proposition 3.3. A pseudo BCK-algebra (A, →,  , 1) is a commutative if and only if (x →
y)   y ≤ (y → x)   x and (x   y) → y ≤ (y   x) → x, for all x, y ∈ A.

Proof. By interchanging x and y we obtain (y → x)   x ≤ (x → y)   y and (y   x) → x ≤
(x   y) → y, for all x, y ∈ A, that is A is commutative.
(cid:3)

Remarks 3.4. (1) Commutative pseudo BE-algebras have the same deﬁnition as pseudo
BCK-algebras. Any commutative pseudo BE-algebra is a pseudo BCK-algebra ([8, Th. 3.4]).
(2) A pseudo BCI-algebra (A, →,  , 1) satisfying the conditions:

(x → y)   y = (y → x)   x,
(x   y) → y = (y   x) → x

for all x, y ∈ A, is a pseudo BCK-algebra ([13, Th. 3.6]).

3), (psBCK ′

We can see that in the deﬁnition of a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra, axiom (psBCK ′
6)
is a consequence of axioms (psBCK ′
4) and the commutativity. Indeed if x → y = 1
and y → x = 1 then we have x = 1   x = (y → x)   x = (x → y)   y = 1   y = y, that is
(psBCK ′
6). Hence the class of commutative pseudo BCK-algebras is a variety. It was proved
in [25, Th. 4.1.11] that the variety of commutative pseudo BCK-algebras is weakly regular,
congruence and 3-permutable. Since for commutative pseudo BCK-algebras axiom (psBCK ′
6)
is not independent, to ﬁnd other axiom systems of commutative pseudo BCK-algebras is an
interesting direction of research. We will generalize to the commutative pseudo BCK-algebras
certain axiom systems proved for commutative BCK-algebras. The ﬁrst equational base for
commutative BCK-algebras was given in 1977 by H. Yutani, [38], [39]. He proved that an
algebra (A, ∗, 0) of type (2, 0) is a commutative BCK-algebra if and only if it satisﬁes the
following identities for all x, y, z ∈ A: (i) x ∗ x = 0, (ii) x ∗ 0 = x, (iii) (x ∗ y) ∗ z = (x ∗ z) ∗ y,
(iv) x ∗ (x ∗ y) = y ∗ (y ∗ x). This result was generalized by J. K¨uhr in [26] to the case of
pseudo BCK-algebras.

Theorem 3.5. ([26, Th. 4.2]) An algebra (A, →,  , 1) of type (2, 2, 0) is a commutative
pseudo BCK-algebra if and only if it satisﬁes the following identities for all x, y, z ∈ A:
(Y1) (x → y)   y = (y → x)   x and (x   y) → y = (y   x) → x;
(Y2) x → (y   z) = y   (x → z);
(Y3) x → x = x   x = 1;
(Y4) 1 → x = 1   x = x.

It is easy to see that condition (Y3) is equivalent to x → 1 = x   1 = 1, for all x ∈ A.
Indeed if x → x = x   x = 1 then 1 = x   x = (1 → x)   x = (x → 1)   1, by (Y1).
Then x → 1 = x → ((x → 1)   1) = (x → 1)   (x → 1) = 1, by (Y2). Similarly x   1 = 1.
Conversely, if x → 1 = x   1 = 1 then x → x = (1   x) → x = (x   1) → 1 = 1 → 1 = 1,

COMMUTATIVE DEDUCTIVE SYSTEMS OF PSEUDO BCK-ALGEBRAS

6

by (Y1) and (Y4). Similarly x   x = 1. We obtain the characterization of a commutative
pseudo BCK-algebra given by J. K¨uhr in [25].

Proposition 3.6. ([25, Prop. 4.1.10]) An algebra (A, →,  , 1) of type (2, 2, 0) is a commuta-
tive pseudo BCK-algebra if and only if it satisﬁes the following identities for all x, y, z ∈ A:
(K1) (x → y)   y = (y → x)   x and (x   y) → y = (y   x) → x;
(K2) x → (y   z) = y   (x → z);
(K3) x → 1 = x   1 = 1;
(K4) 1 → x = 1   x = x.

An axiom system for commutative BCK-algebras consisting of three identities was given
by M. Pa lasi´nski and B. Wo´zniakowska in [32]. They proved that an algebra (A, ∗, 0) of type
(2, 0) is a commutative BCK-algebra if and only if it satisﬁes the following identities for all
x, y, z ∈ A: (i) ((x ∗ y) ∗ z) ∗ ((x ∗ z) ∗ y) = 0, (ii) x ∗ (x ∗ y) = y ∗ (y ∗ x), (iii) z ∗ ((x ∗ y) ∗ x) = z
(see also [21, Th. 2.1.7]). Following the idea used by M. Pa lasi´nski and B. Wo´zniakowska,
in what follows we give a generalization of this system to the case of commutative pseudo
BCK-algebras.

Theorem 3.7. An algebra (A, →,  , 1) of type (2, 2, 0) is a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra
if and only if it satisﬁes the following identities for all x, y, z ∈ A:
(P1) (x → (y   z)) → (y   (x → z)) = 1 and (x   (y → z)) → (y → (x   z)) = 1;
(P2) (x → y)   y = (y → x)   x and (x   y) → y = (y   x) → x;
(P3) (x → (y   x)) → z = (x → (y   x))   z = z and

(x   (y → x)) → z = (x   (y → x))   z = z.

Proof. If (A, →,  , 1) is a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra then one can easily show that
conditions (P1) − (P3) hold.
Conversely, consider an algebra (A, →,  , 1) satisfying conditions (P1) − (P3). We will prove
that A satisﬁes conditions (Y1) − (Y4) from Theorem 3.5, so it is a commutative pseudo BCK-
algebra. As mentioned above, we will follow the ideea used in [32].
First we show that x → (y   x) = u → (v   u) and x   (y → x) = u   (v → u), for all
x, y, u, v ∈ A. Indeed by (P3) and (P2), we have:

x → (y   x) = (x → (y   x))   (x → (y   x))

= ((u → (v   u)) → (x → (y   x)))   (x → (y   x))
= ((x → (y   x)) → (u → (v   u)))   (u → (v   u))
= (u → (v   u))   (u → (v   u))
= u → (v   u).

Similarly x   (y → x) = u   (v → u).
Replacing u with x and v with u → (v   u) in the identity x → (y   x) = u → (v   u) and
applying (P3) we get x → (y   x) = x → ((u → (v   u))   x) = x → x.
Similarly x   (y → x) = x   x, u → (v   u) = u → u, u   (v → u) = u   u. It follows
that x → x = u → u and x   x = u   u. From the identity x → x = u → u, replacing u by
x → (x   x) and applying (P3) and (P1) we get:

x → x = (x → (x   x)) → (x → (x   x)) = x → (x   x)

= (x   (x → x)) → (x → (x   x)) = 1.

Similarly from x   x = u   u, replacing u by x   (x → x) we obtain:

x   x = (x   (x → x))   (x   (x → x)) = x   (x → x)

= (x → (x   x)) → (x   (x → x)) = 1, hence (Y3) is proved.

From x → x = 1, x → (y   x) = x → x and (P3) we get 1   x = (x → x)   x = (x → (y  
x))   x = x. Similarly from x   x = 1, x   (y → x) = x   x and (P3) we obtain 1 → x = 1,
that is (Y4). If x → y = 1 and y → x = 1 then by (Y4) and (P2) we have x = 1   x = (y →
x)   x = (x → y)   y = 1   y = y. It follows that (psBCK ′
6) holds. Exchanging x and y in
(P1) we have (y → (x   z)) → (x   (y → z)) = 1 and (y   (x → z)) → (x → (y   z)) = 1.
Applying (psBCK ′
6) it follows that x → (y   z) = y   (x → z), that is (Y2). Since (P2) is

in fact (Y1), we conclude that A satisﬁes conditions (Y1) − (Y4) from Theorem 3.5, thus it is
a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra.

W.H. Cornish gave in [10] an axiom system for commutative BCK-algebras consisting of
two identities, namely an algebra (A, ∗, 0) of type (2, 0) is a commutative BCK-algebra if
and only if it satisﬁes the following identities for all x, y, z ∈ A: (i) x ∗ (0 ∗ y) = x, (ii)
(x ∗ z) ∗ (x ∗ y) = (y ∗ z) ∗ (y ∗ x) (see also [21, Th. 2.1.8]). In the next result we generalize
Cornish’s axiom system to the case of commutative pseudo BCK-algebras.

Theorem 3.8. An algebra (A, →,  , 1) of type (2, 2, 0) is a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra
if and only if it satisﬁes the following identities for all x, y, z ∈ A:
(C1) (x → 1)   y = (x   1) → y = y;
(C2) (x → y)   (z → y) = (y → x)   (z → x);
(C3) (x   y) → (z   y) = (y   x) → (z   x).

Proof. Let (A, →,  , 1) be a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra. By (psBCK ′
5), x → 1 = 1, so
x ≤ 1, hence x   1 = 1. Applying (psBCK ′
3) we get (x → 1)   y = (x   1) → y = y, that is
(C1). From (x → y)   y = (y → x)   x we have z → ((x → y)   y) = z → ((y → x)   x),
and applying Lemma 2.1(4), it follows that (x → y)   (z → y) = (y → x)   (z → x), that is
(C2). Similarly from (x   y) → y = (y   x) → x we get (x   y) → (z   y) = (y   x) →
(z   x), that is (C3).
Conversely, consider an algebra (A, →,  , 1) satisfying conditions (C1), (C2), (C3).
Applying (C1) and (C2) we have:
(y → x)   x = (y → x)   ((y   1) → x) = (x → y)   ((y   1) → y) = (x → y)   y.
Similarly (y   x) → x = (x   y) → y, hence the commutativity is proved.
Applying (C1) we get (1 → 1)   1 = 1 and 1 → x = ((1 → 1)   1) → x = x, and similarly
1   x = x. Hence (psBCK ′
4) are proved.
By (C1) we have ((x → 1) → 1)   (1 → 1) = 1   1 = 1.
Applying (C1) we get (x → 1)   (x → 1) = x → 1 and (x   1) → (x   1) = x   1.
On the other hand, by (psBCK ′

3) and (psBCK ′

3) and (C2) we have:

(x → 1)   (x → 1) = (1 → (x → 1))   (1 → (x → 1))

= ((x → 1) → 1)   (1 → 1) = 1   1 = 1.

Hence x → 1 = 1 and similarly x   1 = 1, that is (psBCK ′
5).
By (C2) we have (y → z)   (x → z) = (z → y)   (x → y), so

(x → y) → ((y → z)   (x → z)) = (x → y) → ((z → y)   (x → y))

= (1   (x → y)) → ((z → y)   (x → y))
= ((x → y)   1) → ((z → y)   1)
= 1 → 1 = 1,

1). Similarly (psBCK ′

that is (psBCK ′
Suppose that x → y = y → x = 1. By (psBCK ′
y = 1   y = (x → y)   y = (y → x)   x = 1   x = x, that is (psBCK ′
We conclude that (A, →,  , 1) is a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra.

2).

4) and by commutativity we have:

6).

(cid:3)

In the next result we give a characterization of commutative pseudo BCK-algebras.

Theorem 3.9. Let (A, →,  , 1) be a pseudo BCK-algebra. The following are equivalent for
all x, y ∈ A:
(a) A is commutative;
(b) x → y = ((y → x)   x) → y and x   y = ((y   x) → x)   y;
(c) (x → y)   y = (((x → y)   y) → x)   x and (x   y) → y = (((x   y) → y)   x) → x;
(d) x ≤ y implies y = (y → x)   x = (y   x) → x.

Proof. (a) ⇒ (b) Since A is commutative, applying Lemma 2.1(6) we get:

x → y = ((x → y)   y) → y = ((y → x)   x) → y and
x   y = ((x   y) → y)   y = ((y   x) → x)   y.

COMMUTATIVE DEDUCTIVE SYSTEMS OF PSEUDO BCK-ALGEBRAS

(b) ⇒ (c) By (b) we have (x → y)   y = (((y → x)   x) → y)   y.
Exchanging x and y we get (y → x)   x = (((x → y)   y) → x)   x.
By (psBCK2) we have (x → y)   y ≤ (((x → y)   y) → x)   x.
It follows that (x → y)   y ≤ (y → x)   x.
Similarly (y → x)   x ≤ (x → y)   y, that is (x → y)   y = (y → x)   x.
Hence (x → y)   y = (((x → y)   y) → x)   x.
Similarly (x   y) → y = (((x   y) → y)   x) → x.
(c) ⇒ (d) Since x ≤ y implies x → y = x   y = 1, applying (c) we get
y = (y → x)   x and y = (y   x) → x.
(d) ⇒ (a) From x ≤ (x → y)   y, applying (d) we have
(x → y)   y = (((x → y)   y) → x)   x.

From y ≤ (x → y)   y, applying Lemma 2.1(2) twice, we get:

((x → y)   y) → x ≤ y → x and
(y → x)   x ≤ (((x → y)   y) → x)   x.

Hence (y → x)   x ≤ (x → y)   y. Similarly (y   x) → x ≤ (x   y) → y.
By Proposition 3.3 it follows that A is commutative.

(cid:3)

Note that the equivalence (a) ⇔ (d) is also proved in [25, Lemma 4.1.4].

Example 3.10. ([26, Ex. 4.1.2]) Let (G, ∨, ∧, ·,−1 , e) be an ℓ-group. On the negative cone
G− = {g ∈ G | g ≤ e} we deﬁne the operations x → y = y · (x ∨ y)−1, x   y = (x ∨ y)−1 · y.
Then (G−, →,  , e) is a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra.

Example 3.11. Let (A, →,  , 1) be a pseudo BCK-algebra. A mapping m : A −→ [0, ∞)
such that m(x → y) = m(x   y) = m(y) − m(x) whenever y ≤ x called a measure on A.
Then, by [3, Prop. 4.3, Th. 4.8], Ker 0(m) = {x ∈ A | m(x) = 0} ∈ DSn(A) and A/Ker 0(m)
is a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra.

Example 3.12. Let (A, →,  , 1) be a pseudo BCK-algebra. A system S of measures on A is
an order-determing system on A if for all measures m ∈ S, m(x) ≥ m(y) implies x ≤ y. If A
possesses an order-determing system S of measures then A is commutative.
Indeed suppose that for x, y ∈ A we have x ≤ y. Then, by [3, Prop. 4.3], m((y   x) → x) =
m((y   x) → x) = m(y), for all m ∈ S. Since S is order-determing then (y → x)   x =
(y   x) → x = y. According to Theorem 3.9, A is a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra.

Example 3.13. Every Wajsberg pseudo-hoop is a commutative pseudo BCK-meet-semilattice.

Remarks 3.14. (1) Any ﬁnite commutative pseudo BCK-algebra is a BCK-algebra (see [26,
Cor. 3.6]).
(2) If (A, →,  , 0, 1) is a bounded commutative pseudo BCK-algebra then x→0 0 = x 0→0 =
x, that is A is an involutive pseudo BCK-algebra. More general, if (A, →,  , a, 1) is a pointed
commutative pseudo BCK-algebra then x−a∼a = x∼a−a = x, for all x ≥ a.

4. Commutative deductive systems of pseudo BCK-algebras

In this section we deﬁne the commutative deductive systems of pseudo BCK-algebras and
we investigate their properties by generalizing some results proved in [21] for the case of
commutative ideals of BCI-algebras. We prove that a pseudo BCK-algebra A is commutative
if and only if all deductive systems of A are commutative. We show that a normal deductive
system H of a pseudo BCK-algebra A is commutative if and only if A/H is a commutative
pseudo BCK-algebra.

Deﬁnition 4.1. A deductive system D of a pseudo BCK-algebra (A, →,  , 1) is called com-
mutative if it satisﬁes the following conditions for all x, y ∈ A:
(cds1) y → x ∈ D implies ((x → y)   y) → x ∈ D;
(cds2) y   x ∈ D implies ((x   y) → y)   x ∈ D.

We will denote by DSc(A) the set of all commutative deductive systems of a pseudo BCK-

algebra A.

Proposition 4.2. A subset D of a pseudo BCK-algebra (A, →,  , 1) is a commutative de-
ductive system of A if and only if it satisﬁes the following conditions for all x, y, z ∈ A:
(1) 1 ∈ D;
(2) z → (y → x) ∈ D and z ∈ D implies ((x → y)   y) → x ∈ D;
(3) z   (y   x) ∈ D and z ∈ D implies ((x   y) → y)   x ∈ D.

Proof. Let D ∈ DSc(A). It follows that 1 ∈ D, that is condition (1) is satisﬁed.
Consider x, y, z ∈ A such that z → (y → x) ∈ D and z ∈ D. Since D is a deductive system,
we have y → x ∈ D, hence ((x → y)   y) → x ∈ D, that is condition (2). Similarly from
z   (y   x) ∈ D and z ∈ D we get ((x   y) → y)   x ∈ D, that is condition (3).
Conversely, let D be a subset of A satisfying conditions (1), (2) and (3). Obviously 1 ∈ D.
Consider x, y ∈ D such that x → y ∈ D and x ∈ D. Since x → (1 → y) = x → y ∈ D,
applying (2) we get y = ((y → 1)   1) → y ∈ D. It follows that D ∈ DS(A).
Let x, y ∈ A such that y → x ∈ D. Since 1 → (y → x) ∈ D and 1 ∈ D, by (2) we get
((x → y)   y) → x ∈ D. Similarly from y   x ∈ D we obtain ((x   y) → y)   x ∈ D. We
conclude that D ∈ DSc(A).
(cid:3)

Example 4.3. Consider the set A = {0, a, b, c, d, 1} and the operations →,   given by the
following tables:

→ 0 a b
0
a
b
c
d
1

c d 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 c 1

0 a b 1 1 1
0 a b
c d 1

.

Then (A, →,  , 1) is a pseudo BCK-algebra (see [25, Ex. 3.1.4]).
One can see that DS(A) = {{1}, {1, c, d}, {1, a, b, c, d}, A}, DSn(A) = {{1}, {1, a, b, c, d}, A},
DSc(A) = {{1, a, b, c, d}, A}.

Example 4.4. Let (A, →,  , 1) be a pseudo BCK-algebra and m : A −→ [0, ∞) be a measure
on A.
It was proved in [3, Prop. 4.2] that m((x → y)   y) = m((y → x)   x) and
m((x   y) → y) = m((y   x) → x), for all x, y ∈ A. Consider x, y ∈ A such that
y → x ∈ Ker 0(m), that is m(y → x) = 0. Since x ≤ (x → y)   y and x ≤ y → x,
we have m(((x → y)   y) → x) = m(x) − m((x → y)   y) = m(x) − m((y → x)  
x) = m(x) − m(x) + m(y → x) = 0. Hence ((x → y)   y) → x ∈ Ker 0(m). Similarly
y   x ∈ Ker 0(m) implies ((x   y) → y)   x ∈ Ker 0(m). Thus Ker 0(m) ∈ DSc(A).

Proposition 4.5. Let (A, →,  , 1) be a pseudo BCK-algebra and D ∈ DSc(A), E ∈ DS(A)
such that D ⊆ E. Then E ∈ DSc(A).

Proof. Consider x, y ∈ A such that u = y → x ∈ E. It follows that y → (u   x) = y → ((y →
x)   x) = 1 ∈ D. Since D is commutative, we have (((u   x) → y)   y) → (u   x) ∈ D.
From D ⊆ E we get (((u   x) → y)   y) → (u   x) ∈ E. Applying Lemma 2.1(4), it follows
that u   ((((u   x) → y)   y) → x) ∈ E. Since u ∈ E, we get (((u   x) → y)   y) → x ∈
E. From x ≤ u   x, we have (u   x) → y ≤ x → y, and (x → y)   y ≤ ((u   x) → y)   y,

COMMUTATIVE DEDUCTIVE SYSTEMS OF PSEUDO BCK-ALGEBRAS

10

and ﬁnally (((u   x) → y)   y) → x ≤ ((x → y)   y) → x. Hence ((x → y)   y) →
x ∈ E. Similarly from y   x ∈ E, we get ((x   y) → y)   x ∈ E. We conclude that
E ∈ DSc(A).
(cid:3)

Corollary 4.6. The deductive system {1} of a pseudo BCK-algebra A is commutative if and
only if DS(A) = DSc(A).

Theorem 4.7. A pseudo BCK-algebra A is commutative if and only if {1} ∈ DSc(A).

Proof. Assume that A is commutative, thus y → x = ((x → y)   y) → x, for all x, y ∈ A.
Consider x, y ∈ A such that y → x ∈ {1}. It follows that ((x → y)   y) → x ∈ {1}. Similarly
from y   x ∈ {1} we get ((x   y) → y)   x ∈ {1}. Thus {1} is a commutative deductive
system of A. Conversely, assume that {1} is a commutative deductive system of A and let
x, y ∈ A such that y ≤ x, that is y → x = 1 ∈ {1}. Since {1} is commutative, it follows
that ((x → y)   y) → x ∈ {1}, that is ((x → y)   y) → x = 1. On the other hand
x → ((x → y)   y) = 1, hence x = (x → y)   y. Applying Theorem 3.9 it follows that A is
commutative.
(cid:3)

Corollary 4.8. A pseudo BCK-algebra A is commutative if and only if DS(A) = DSc(A).

Theorem 4.9. Let A be a pseudo BCK-algebra and H ∈ DSn(A). Then H ∈ DSc(A) if and
only if X/H is a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra.

Proof. Assume H ∈ DSc(A) and x, y ∈ A such that [y]ΘH → [x]ΘH = [1]ΘH , so [y → x]ΘH =
[1]ΘH , that is y → x ∈ H. Since H is commutative, we get ((x → y)   y) → x ∈ H,
thus (([x]ΘH → [y]ΘH )   [y]ΘH ) → [x]ΘH = [((x → y)   y) → x]ΘH = [1]ΘH . Hence
[1]ΘH ∈ DSc(A/H), so X/H is a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra.
Conversely, if X/H is a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra then [1]ΘH ∈ DSc(A/H). If y →
x ∈ H = [1]ΘH , we have [y]ΘH → [x]ΘH ∈ [1]ΘH . Since [1]ΘH is commutative, we get
(([x]ΘH → [y]ΘH )   [y]ΘH ) → [x]ΘH = [1]ΘH , so [((x → y)   y) → x]ΘH = [1]ΘH , that is
((x → y)   y) → x ∈ H. Similarly from y   x ∈ H, we get ((x   y) → y)   x ∈ H. Hence
H ∈ DSc(A).
(cid:3)

5. State pseudo BCK-algebras

Similarly as in [2] for the case of BCK-algebras, in this section we introduce the notions
of state operators of type I and type II on pseudo BCK-algebras, and we apply the results
proved in the previous sections to investigate the properties of state operators. For the case of
commutative pseudo BCK-algebras we show that the state operators of type I and II coincide.
We show that the kernel of a type II state operator is a commutative deductive system. We
deﬁne the notion of a normal state operator, proving that any type I or type II state operator
on a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra is normal. We also prove that any normal type II
state operator is a normal type I state operator, while a normal type I state operator is a
normal type II state operator if its kernel is a commutative deductive system.

Deﬁnition 5.1. Let (A, →,  , 1) be a pseudo BCK-algebra and µ : A −→ A be a unary
operator on A. For all x, y ∈ A consider the following axioms:
(IS1) µ(x) ≤ µ(y), whenever x ≤ y,
(IS2) µ(x → y) = µ((x → y)   y) → µ(y) and µ(x   y) = µ((x   y) → y)   µ(y),
2) µ(x → y) = µ((y → x)   x) → µ(y) and µ(x   y) = µ((y   x) → x)   µ(y),
(IS
(IS3) µ(µ(x) → µ(y)) = µ(x) → µ(y) and µ(µ(x)   µ(y)) = µ(x)   µ(y).
Then:
(i) µ is called an internal state of type I or a state operator of type I or a type I state operator

if it satisﬁes axioms (IS1), (IS2), (IS3);
(ii) µ is called an internal state of type II or a state operator of type II or a type II state
operator if it satisﬁes axioms (IS1), (IS
The structure (A, →,  , µ, 1) ((A, µ), for short) is called a state pseudo BCK-algebra of type
I (type II) state pseudo BCK-algebra, respectively.

2), (IS3).

′

Denote IS(I)(A) and IS(II)(A) the set of all internal states of type I and II on a pseudo

BCK-algebra A, respectively.
For µ ∈ IS(I)(A) or µ ∈ IS(II)(A), Ker (µ) = {x ∈ A | µ(x) = 1} is called the kernel of µ.
Note that the type I and II state operators are called in [2] left and right state operators,
respectively.

Example 5.2. Let (A, →,  , 1) be a pseudo BCK-algebra and 1A, IdA : A −→ A, deﬁned by
1A(x) = 1 and IdA(x) = x for all x ∈ A. Then 1A, IdA ∈ IS(I)(A) and 1A ∈ IS(II)(A).

Example 5.3. Let (A1, →1,  1, 11) and (A2, →2,  2, 12) be two pseudo BCK-algebras. De-
note A = A1 × A2 = {(x1, x2) | x1 ∈ A1, x2 ∈ A2} and for all (x1, x2), (y1, y2) ∈ A,
deﬁne the operations →,  , 1 as follows:
(x1, x2) → (y1, y2) = (x1 →1 y1, x2 →2 y2),
(x1, x2)   (y1, y2) = (x1  1 y1, x2  2 y2), 1 = (11, 12). Obviously (A, →,  , 1) is a pseudo
BCK-algebra. Consider µ1 ∈ IS(I)(A1), µ2 ∈ IS(I)(A2) and deﬁne the map µ : A −→ A by
µ((x, y)) = (µ1(x), µ2(x)). Then µ ∈ IS(I)(A). Similarly if µ1 ∈ IS(II)(A1), µ2 ∈ IS (II)(A2),
then µ ∈ IS(II)(A).

Proposition 5.4. A pseudo BCK-algebra A is commutative if and only if IS(I)(A) = IS(II)(A).

Proof. It is clear that if A is commutative then IS(I)(A) = IS(II)(A). Conversely, suppose
that IS(I)(A) = IS(II)(A). Since IdA ∈ IS(I)(A), we have IdA ∈ IS(II)(A), so x → y =
((y → x)   x) → y and x   y = ((y   x) → x)   y, for all x, y ∈ A. According to Theorem
3.9, it follows that A is a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra.
(cid:3)

Proposition 5.5. Let (A, →,  , µ, 1) be a type I or a type II state pseudo BCK-algebra. Then
the following hold:
(1) µ(1) = 1;
(2) µ(µ(x)) = µ(x), for all x ∈ A;
(3) µ(x → y) ≤ µ(x) → µ(y) and µ(x   y) ≤ µ(x)   µ(y), for all x, y ∈ A;
(4) Ker (µ) ∈ DS(A);
(5) Im (µ) is a subalgebra of A;
(6) Im (µ) = {x ∈ A | x = µ(x)};
(7) Ker (µ) ∩ Im (µ) = {1};
(8) if A is commutative then µ(x → y)   µ(y) = µ(x   y) → µ(y), for all x, y ∈ A.

Proof. (1) From (IS2) and (IS
(2) Applying (1) and (IS3) we have:

′

2) for x = y = 1 we get µ(1) = µ(1) → µ(1) = 1.

µ(µ(x)) = µ(1 → µ(x)) = µ(µ(1) → µ(x)) = µ(1) → µ(x) = 1 → µ(x) = µ(x).

(3) If µ ∈ IS(I)(A) then from x ≤ (x → y)   y we get µ(x) ≤ µ((x → y)   y), so
µ((x → y)   y) → µ(y) ≤ µ(x) → µ(y), that is µ(x → y) ≤ µ(x) → µ(y).
Similarly µ(x   y) ≤ µ(x)   µ(y).
If µ ∈ IS(II)(A) then from x ≤ (y → x)   x we have µ(x) ≤ µ((y → x)   x) and in a similar
way we get µ(x → y) ≤ µ(x) → µ(y) and µ(x   y) ≤ µ(x)   µ(y).
(4) Consider x, x → y ∈ Ker (µ), that is µ(x) = µ(x → y) = 1.
Applying (3) we have 1 = µ(x → y) ≤ µ(x) → µ(y), so µ(x) → µ(y) = 1.
It follows that µ(y) = 1 → µ(y) = µ(1) → µ(y) = µ(x) → µ(y) = 1, hence y ∈ Ker (µ).
Since 1 ∈ Ker (µ), it follows that Ker (µ) ∈ DS(A).
(5) Since 1 = µ(1) ∈ Im (µ), we have 1 ∈ Im (µ).

COMMUTATIVE DEDUCTIVE SYSTEMS OF PSEUDO BCK-ALGEBRAS

12

If x, y ∈ Im (µ) then from µ(x) → µ(y) = µ(µ(x) → µ(y)) and µ(x)   µ(y) = µ(µ(x)   µ(y)),
it follows that µ(x) → µ(y), µ(x)   µ(y) ∈ Im (µ). Thus Im (µ) is a subalgebra of A.
(6) Clearly {x ∈ A | x = µ(x)} ⊆ Im (µ). Let x ∈ Im (µ), that is there exists x1 ∈ A such that
x = µ(x1). It follows that x = µ(x1) = µ(µ(x1)) = µ(x), that is x ∈ Im (µ).
Thus Im (µ) ⊆ {x ∈ A | x = µ(x)} and we conclude that Im (µ) = {x ∈ A | x = µ(x)}.
(7) Let y ∈ Ker (µ) ∩ Im (µ), so µ(y) = 1 and there exists x ∈ A such that µ(x) = y.
It follows that y = µ(x) = µ(µ(x)) = µ(y) = 1, thus Ker (µ) ∩ Im (µ) = {1}.
(8) If A is commutative then it is is a join-semilattice, where x ∨ y = (x → y)   y = (x  
y) → y. Applying Lemma 2.1(6) we have:

µ(x ∨ y) = µ((x → y)   y) = µ(((x → y)   y) → y)   µ(y) = µ(x → y)   µ(y) and
µ(x ∨ y) = µ((x   y) → y) = µ(((x   y) → y)   y) → µ(y) = µ(x   y) → µ(y).

Hence µ(x → y)   µ(y) = µ(x   y) → µ(y).

(cid:3)

Proposition 5.6. Let (A, →,  , µ, 1) be a commutative type I state pseudo BCK-algebra.
Then Ker (µ) ∈ DSc(A).

Proof. It is a consequence of Proposition 5.5(4) and Corollary 4.8.

(cid:3)

Proposition 5.7. Let (A, →,  , µ, 1) be a type II pseudo BCK-algebra. Then the following
hold:
(1) y ≤ x implies µ(x → y) = µ(x) → µ(y) and µ(x   y) = µ(x)   µ(y);
(2) x → y ∈ Ker (µ) iﬀ ((y → x)   x) → y ∈ Ker (µ);
(3) x   y ∈ Ker (µ) iﬀ ((y   x) → x)   y ∈ Ker (µ);
(4) Ker (µ) ∈ DSc(A).

Proof. (1) If y ≤ x, we have:

µ(x → y) = µ((y → x)   x) → µ(y) = µ(1   x) → µ(y) = µ(x) → µ(y).

Similarly µ(x   y) = µ(x)   µ(y).
(2) Suppose x → y ∈ Ker (µ), that is µ(x → y) = 1. Since y ≤ (y → x)   x, applying (1) we
get µ(((y → x)   x) → y) = µ((y → x)   x) → µ(y), hence
1 = µ(x → y) = µ((y → x)   x) → µ(y) = µ(((y → x)   x) → y).
Thus ((y → x)   x) → y ∈ Ker (µ).
Conversely, suppose ((y → x)   x) → y ∈ Ker (µ).
From x ≤ (y → x)   x we have ((y → x)   x) → y ≤ x → y.
Since Ker (µ) is a deductive system of A, we get x → y ∈ Ker (µ).
(3) Similarly as (2).
(4) It follows from (2) and (3).

Deﬁnition 5.8. An internal state µ of type I or II on a pseudo BCK-algebra A is said to be
normal if Ker (µ) is a normal deductive system of A. In this case (A, µ) is said to be a normal
type I(type II) state pseudo BCK-algebra.

(A) the set of all normal internal states of type I and II on a

pseudo BCK-algebra A, respectively.

Proposition 5.9. Any internal state of type I or type II on a commutative pseudo BCK-
algebra is normal.

Proof. Let µ be an internal state of type I of a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra A. Consider
x, y ∈ A such that x → y ∈ Ker (µ), that is µ(x → y) = 1. It follows that µ((x → y)   y) →
µ(y) = 1. Since A is commutative, we get µ((x   y) → y) → µ(y) = 1, that is µ(x   y) = 1,
hence x   y ∈ Ker (µ). Similarly from x   y ∈ Ker (µ) we get x → y ∈ Ker (µ). Hence
Ker (µ) is a normal deductive system on A. The case of an internal state of type II on A can
be treated in the same way as the case of type I internal state.

Proposition 5.10. Let (A, µ) be a a type I or type II state pseudo BCK-algebra. If A is a
meet-semilattice and µ satisﬁes the condition:

µ(x → y) = µ(x) → µ(x ∧ y) and µ(x   y) = µ(x)   µ(x ∧ y),

for all x, y ∈ A then µ is a normal state operator on A.

Proof. Consider x, y ∈ A such that x → y ∈ Ker (µ), that is µ(x → y) = 1. It follows that
µ(x) → µ(x ∧ y) = 1, so µ(x) ≤ µ(x ∧ y), hence µ(x) = µ(x ∧ y). We get µ(x   y) =
µ(x)   µ(x ∧ y) = 1, that is x   y ∈ Ker (µ). Similaly, from x   y ∈ Ker (µ) we have
x → y ∈ Ker (µ). We conclude that Ker (µ) is a normal deductive system of A, thus µ is a
normal state operator on A.
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 5.11. Let (A, ∧, →,  , 1) be a pseudo BCK-meet-semilattice and µ be a unary
operator on A. Then (A, µ) is called a state pseudo BCK-meet-semilattice of type I (type II)
or a type I (type II) state pseudo BCK-meet-semilattice if (A, µ) is a type I (type II) state
pseudo BCK-algebra and µ satisﬁes the following condition, for all x, y ∈ A:
(IS4) µ(µ(x) ∧ µ(y)) = µ(x) ∧ µ(y).

Proposition 5.12. Let (A, ∧, →,  , 1) be a linearly ordered pseudo BCK-meet-semilattice
and µ be a unary operator on A. Then:
(1) if (A, µ) is a type I (type II) state pseudo BCK-algebra then (A, µ) is a type I (type II)
state pseudo BCK-meet-semilattice;
(2) if (A, µ) is a normal type I (type II) state pseudo BCK-algebra then (A, µ) is a normal
type I (type II) state pseudo BCK-meet-semilattice.

Proof. (1) It is straightforward.
(2) It is a consequence of Proposition 5.10.

(cid:3)

Corollary 5.13. Let (A, ⊙, →,  , 1) be a simple basic pseudo-hoop. Then:
(1) if (A, µ) is a type I (type II) state pseudo BCK-algebra then (A, µ) is a type I (type II)
state pseudo BCK-meet-semilattice;
(2) if (A, µ) is a normal type I (type II) state pseudo BCK-algebra then (A, µ) is a normal
type I (type II) state pseudo BCK-meet-semilattice.

Proposition 5.14. Let (A, →,  , µ, 1) be a normal type II pseudo BCK-algebra. Then:
(1) the map ˆµ : A/Ker (µ) → A/Ker (µ) deﬁned by ˆµ(x/Ker (µ)) = µ(x)/Ker (µ) is both a
normal type I and type II state operator on A/Ker (µ);
(2) (A, µ) is a normal type I state pseudo BCK-algebra.

Proof. (1) If x/Ker (µ) = y/Ker (µ) then x → y, y → x ∈ Ker (µ), that is µ(x → y) = µ(y →
x) = 1. Applying Proposition 5.5(3), it follows that µ(x) = µ(y). Hence ˆµ is well deﬁned. The
proof of the fact that ˆµ is a normal type II state on A/Ker (µ) is straightforward. Since Ker (µ)
is a normal commutative deductive system of A then according to Theorem 4.9, A/Ker (µ) is
a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra. By Proposition 5.4, ˆµ is also a normal type I state on
A/Ker (µ).
(2) Let x, y ∈ A. Since A/Ker (µ) is a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra, it follows that

((y → x)   x)/Ker (µ) = ((x → y)   y)/Ker (µ) and
((y   x) → x)/Ker (µ) = ((x   y) → y)/Ker (µ).

Similarly as in (1) we get

µ((y → x)   x) = µ((x → y)   y) and
µ((y   x) → x) = µ((x   y) → y).

Hence

µ((y → x)   x) → µ(x) = µ((x → y)   y) → µ(y) and
µ((y   x) → x)   µ(x) = µ((x   y) → y)   µ(y).

Thus (A, µ) is a normal type I state pseudo BCK-algebra.

Theorem 5.15. Let µ : A −→ A be a map on a pseudo BCK-algebra A. Then (A, µ) is a
normal type II state pseudo BCK-algebra if and only if (A, µ) is a normal type I state pseudo
BCK-algebra and Ker (µ) ∈ DSc(A).

Proof. Suppose that (A, µ) is a normal type II state pseudo BCK-algebra. Then, according to
Proposition 5.14, (A, µ) is a normal type I state pseudo BCK-algebra. Conversely, let (A, µ)
be a normal type I state pseudo BCK-algebra such that Ker (µ) is a commutative deductive
system of A. It follows that

((y → x)   x)/Ker (µ) = ((x → y)   y)/Ker (µ) and
((y   x) → x)/Ker (µ) = ((x   y) → y)/Ker (µ),

for all x, y ∈ A. Similarly as in the proof of Proposition 5.14, we have

µ((y → x)   x) → µ(x) = µ((x → y)   y) → µ(y) and
µ((y   x) → x)   µ(x) = µ((x   y) → y)   µ(y).

Thus (A, µ) is a normal type II state pseudo BCK-algebra.

Example 5.16. Consider the pseudo BCK-algebra (A, →,  , 1) from Example 4.3 and the

6. State-morphism pseudo BCK-algebras

In this section we introduce and study the notion of state-morphism operators on a pseudo
BCK-algebra showing that any normal type II state operator on a linearly ordered pseudo
BCK-algebra is a state-morphism. For the case of a linearly ordered commutative pseudo
BCK-algebra, we prove that any type I or type II state operator is also a state-morphism
operator.

Deﬁnition 6.1. Let (A, →,  , 1) be a pseudo BCK-algebra. A homomorphism µ : A −→ A
is called a state-morphism operator on A if µ2 = µ, where µ2 = µ ◦ µ. The pair (A, µ) is called
a state-morphism pseudo BCK-algebra.

Denote SM(A) the set of all state-morphism operators on a pseudo BCK-algebra A.

Examples 6.2. (1) 1A, IdA ∈ SM(A) for any pseudo BCK-algebra A.
(2) If A is the pseudo BCK-algebra from Example 5.16 then SM(A) = {µ3, µ6, µ10}.
(3) If (A, →,  , 0, 1) is a bounded commutative pseudo BCK-algebra and µ : A −→ A deﬁned
by µ(x) = x→0 0 then µ ∈ SM(A).

Example 6.3. Let (A1, →1,  1, 11) and (A2, →2,  2, 12) be two pseudo BCK-algebras and
let A be the pseudo BCK-algebra deﬁned in Example 5.3. Then the maps µ1, µ2 : A −→ A
deﬁned by µ1((x, y)) = (x, x) and µ2((x, y)) = (y, y), for all (x, y) ∈ A are state-morphism
operators on A.

Remark 6.4. By Lemma 2.1(6), every state-morphism pseudo BCK-algebra is a type I state
pseudo BCK-algebra, but not every state-morphism pseudo BCK-algebra is a type II state
pseudo BCK-algebra. For example IdA is a state-morphism operator and a type I state
operator on the pseudo BCK-algebra A, but it is a type II state operator iﬀ A is a commutative
pseudo BCK-algebra.

Proposition 6.5. Let (A, →,  , 1) be a linearly ordered pseudo BCK-algebra. Then:
(1) Any normal type II state operator on A is a state-morphism operator;
(2) If A is commutative then any state operator on A is a state-morphism operator.

′

Proof. (1) Let µ be a normal type II state operator on A. According to Proposition 5.14, µ
is also a type I state operator. If x ≤ y then by Proposition 5.5(1), 1 = µ(1) = µ(x → y) ≤
µ(x) → µ(y) = 1. Hence µ(x → y) = µ(x) → µ(y) and similarly µ(x   y) = µ(x)   µ(y).
If y ≤ x then by (IS
2) we have µ(x → y) = µ(x) → µ(y) and µ(x   y) = µ(x)   µ(y). It
follows that µ is a homomorphism on A. Since by Proposition 5.5(2), µ2 = µ, we conclude
that µ is a state-morphism operator on A.
(2) If x ≤ y, similarly as in (1) we get µ(x → y) = µ(x) → µ(y) and µ(x   y) = µ(x)   µ(y).
If y ≤ x then µ(x → y) = µ((y → x)   x) → µ(y) = µ(x) → µ(y) and similarly µ(x   y) =
µ(x)   µ(y). Thus µ is a state-morphism operator on A.
(cid:3)

Remark 6.6. In general a type I state operator on a linearly ordered pseudo BCK-algebra
A is not necessarily a state-morphism operator on A. Indeed consider the set A = {0, a, b, 1},
where 0 < a < b < 1, and the operations →,   given by the following tables:

→ 0 a b 1
1 1 1 1

Then (A, →,  , 1) is a linearly ordered pseudo BCK-algebra (see [25]). Since (a → b)   b =
b 6= 1 = (b → a)   a, it follows that A is not commutative. We can easily see that the map
µ : A −→ A, deﬁned by µ(0) = µ(a) = a, µ(b) = µ(1) = 1 is a type I state operator on A, but
it is not a state-morphism operator.

For µ ∈ SM(A), Ker (µ) = {x ∈ A | µ(x) = 1} is called the kernel of µ.

Lemma 6.7. For any µ ∈ SM(A), Ker (µ) ∈ DSn(A).

Proof. The proof is straightforward.

(cid:3)

Proposition 6.8. Let (A, µ) be a commutative state-morphism pseudo BCK-algebra. Then
the following hold:
(1) Im (µ) is a commutative pseudo BCK-algebra;
(2) µ(x ∨ y) = µ(x) ∨ µ(y) and µ(µ(x) ∨ µ(y)) = µ(x) ∨ µ(y), for all x, y ∈ A.

Proof. Since µ is a type I state operator on A, by Remark 6.4, applying Proposition 5.5(5) it
follows that Im (µ) is a subalgebra of A. The rest of the proof is straightforward.
(cid:3)

Proposition 6.9. Let (A, µ) be a state-morphism pseudo BCK-algebra. The following hold:
(1) Ker (µ) = {µ(x) → x | x ∈ A} = {x → µ(x) | x ∈ A}
= {µ(x)   x | x ∈ A} = {x   µ(x) | x ∈ A};

(2) if Ker (µ) = {1} then µ = IdA.

Proof. (1) Since µ2 = µ and µ is a homomorphism, we have µ(µ(x) → x) = µ(x) → µ(x) = 1,
so µ(x) → x ∈ Ker (µ). If x ∈ Ker (µ), we have x = 1 → x = µ(x) → x ∈ {µ(x) → x | x ∈ A}.
Hence Ker (µ) = {µ(x) → x | x ∈ A}.
Similarly Ker (µ) = {x → µ(x) | x ∈ A} = {µ(x)   x | x ∈ A} = {x   µ(x) | x ∈ A}.
(2) For any x ∈ A, µ(x) → x, x → µ(x) ∈ Ker (µ) = {1}, hence µ(x) = x.

(cid:3)

Corollary 6.10. If A is a simple pseudo BCK-algebra then SM(A) = {1A, IdA}.

Deﬁnition 6.11. Let (A, µ) be a state-morphism pseudo BCK-algebra. A deductive system
D of A is called a µ-state deductive system if µ(D) ⊆ D. Denote by SDSµ(A) the set of all
µ-state deductive systems of (A, µ).

Theorem 6.12. Let (A, µ) be a state-morphism pseudo BCK-algebra. The following hold:
(1) µ is injective iﬀ Ker (µ) = {1};
(2) if D ∈ DS(A) then µ−1(D) ∈ DS(A) and Ker (µ) ⊆ µ−1(D);
(3) if D ∈ DSn(A) then µ−1(D) ∈ DSn(A);
(4) if D ∈ DSc(A) then µ−1(D) ∈ DSc(A);
(5) if µ is surjective and D ∈ SDSµ(A) then µ(D), µ(µ(D)) ∈ SDSµ(A).

Proof. (1) Suppose that µ is injective and let x ∈ Ker (µ). It follows that µ(x) = 1 = µ(1),
hence x = 1. Conversely, suppose that Ker (µ) = {1} and consider x, y ∈ A such that
µ(x) = µ(y). We get µ(x → y) = µ(x) → µ(y) = 1, so x → y ∈ Ker (µ). It follows that
x → y = 1, that is x ≤ y. Similarly we have y ≤ x, so x = y. Thus µ is injective.
(2) Consider D ∈ DS(A). Since 1 ∈ D, we have µ(x) = 1 ∈ D for all x ∈ Ker (µ), hence
Ker (µ) ⊆ µ−1(D). Let x, x → y ∈ µ−1(D), that is µ(x), µ(x → y) ∈ D.
It follows that
µ(x), µ(x) → µ(y) ∈ D, so µ(y) ∈ D. Hence y ∈ µ−1(D), that is µ−1(D) ∈ DS(A).
(3) Suppose D ∈ DSn(A). Then x → y ∈ µ−1(D) iﬀ µ(x → y) ∈ D iﬀ µ(x) → µ(y) ∈ D iﬀ
µ(x)   µ(y) ∈ D iﬀ µ(x   y) ∈ D iﬀ x   y ∈ µ−1(D). Hence µ−1(D) ∈ DSn(A).
(4) Consider D ∈ DSc(A) and let x, y ∈ A such that y → x ∈ µ−1(D), that is µ(y → x) ∈ D,
so µ(y) → µ(x) ∈ D. Since D is commutative, it follows that ((µ(x) → µ(y))   µ(y)) →
µ(x) ∈ D, so µ(((x → y)   y) → x) ∈ D. Hence ((x → y)   y) → x ∈ µ−1(D). Similarly
y   x ∈ µ−1(D) implies ((x   y) → y)   x ∈ µ−1(D). Hence µ−1(D) ∈ DSc(A).
(5) Since 1 ∈ D, we have 1 = µ(1) ∈ µ(D). Consider x ∈ µ(D), y ∈ A such that x → y ∈ µ(D).

There exists x1 ∈ D such that µ(x1) = x, and from the surjectivity of µ, there exists y1 ∈ A
such that µ(y1) = y. We have x → y ∈ µ(D) iﬀ µ(x1) → µ(y1) ∈ µ(D) iﬀ µ(x1 → y1) ∈
µ(D) ⊆ D, so x1 → y1 ∈ µ−1(D). Since µ−1(D) ∈ DS(A), we have y1 ∈ µ−1(D), that is
y = µ(y1) ∈ µ(D). Hence µ(D) ∈ DS(A), so µ(D) ∈ SDSµ(A).
Let x ∈ µ(µ(D)), so there exist x1 ∈ µ(D) and x2 ∈ D such that x = µ(x1) and x1 = µ(x2).
It follows that x = µ(µ(x2)) = µ(x2) = x1 ∈ µ(D), hence µ(µ(D)) ⊆ µ(D). Since µ(D) ∈
DS(A), we get µ(µ(D)) ∈ SDSµ(A).
(cid:3)
Corollary 6.13. If D ∈ SDSµ(A) with µ surjective then µn(D) ∈ SDSµ(A), for all n ∈ N,
n ≥ 2, where µn = µn−1 ◦ µ.

Proposition 6.14. Let (A, µ) be a state-morphism pseudo BCK-algebra and the map ˆµ :
A/Ker (µ) → A/Ker (µ), deﬁned by ˆµ(x/Ker (µ)) = µ(x)/Ker (µ). Then (A/Ker (µ), ˆµ) is a
state-morphism pseudo BCK-algebra.

Proof. If x/Ker (µ) = y/Ker (µ) then x → y, y → x ∈ Ker (µ), that is µ(x → y) = µ(y → x) =
1. It follows that µ(x) → µ(y) = µ(y) → µ(x) = 1, so µ(x) = µ(y). Hence ˆµ is well deﬁned.
The proof of the fact that ˆµ is a state-morphism on A/Ker (µ) is straightforward.
(cid:3)

Theorem 6.15. Let (A, µ) be a state-morphism pseudo BCK-algebra and π = πKer (µ) be the
canonical projection from A to A/Ker (µ). Then π ◦ µ = π.

Proof. By Proposition 6.9(1) for all x ∈ A, (x, µ(x)) ∈ ΘKer (µ), thus we have µ(x)/Ker (µ) =
x/Ker (µ), so π(µ(x)) = µ(x)/Ker (µ) = x/Ker (µ) = π(x). Hence π ◦ µ = π.
(cid:3)

7. Concluding remarks

In this paper we generalized the equational bases given by M. Pa lasi´nski and B. Wo´zniakowska
in [32] and by W.H. Cornish in [10] for commutative BCK-algebras to the case of commuta-
tive pseudo BCK-algebras. We proved certain results regarding the commutative deductive
systems of pseudo BCK-algebras and we gave a characterization of commutative pseudo BCK-
algebras in terms of commutative deductive systems. We applied these results to investigate
the state pseudo BCK-algebras and the state-morphism pseudo BCK-algebras. As another
direction of research, one could investigate the n-fold commutative pseudo BCK-algebras and
the n-fold commutative deductive systems of pseudo BCK-algebras. We recall that a BCK-
algebra (A, ∗, 0) is called n-fold commutative if there exists a ﬁxed natural number n such
that the identity x ∗ y = x ∗ (y ∗ (y ∗ xn)), where y ∗ x0 = y, y ∗ xn+1 = (y ∗ xn) ∗ x, holds for all
x, y ∈ A (see [37]). An ideal I of a BCK-algebra (A, ∗, 0) is called n-fold commutative if there
exists a ﬁxed natural number n such that x ∗ y ∈ I implies x ∗ y = x ∗ (y ∗ (y ∗ xn)) ∈ I for
all x, y ∈ A (see [21]). State pseudo BCK-algebras and state-morphism pseudo BCK-algebras
could be studied in the context of n-fold commutative pseudo BCK-algebras and n-fold com-
mutative deductive systems. These results could be extended to more general structures, such
as pseudo BE-algebras and pseudo BCI-algebras.
