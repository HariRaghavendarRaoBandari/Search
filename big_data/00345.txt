We predict a repulsive Casimir–Polder-type dispersion interaction between a single neutron and
a metal or dielectric surface. Our model scenario assumes a single neutron subject to an external
magnetic ﬁeld. Due to its intrinsic magnetic moment, the neutron then forms a magnetisable two-
level system which can exchange virtual photons with a nearby surface. The resulting dispersion
interaction between a purely magnetic object (neutron) and a purely electric one (surface) is found to
be repulsive. Its magnitude is considerably smaller than than the standard atom–surface Casimir–
Polder force due to the magnetic nature of the interaction and the smallness of the electron-to-
neutron mass ratio. Nevertheless, we show that it can be comparable to the gravitational potential
of the same surface.

As originally conceived by Casimir, the attractive force
between two perfectly conducting parallel plates is a con-
sequence of the quantum ﬂuctuations of the electromag-
netic ﬁeld which persist even when the latter is in its vac-
uum state of zero temperature [1]. The plates, which are
merely loci of boundary conditions supporting standing-
wave modes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in this picture,
are assigned a much more active role in Lifshitz’ theory
for two dielectric plates [2]: Here, the ﬂuctuating polar-
isations within the dielectric media ultimately generate
the force.
It is hence apparent that dispersion forces
may much more generally arise as eﬀective electromag-
netic forces between any polarisable objects. They may
be attributed to quantum zero-point ﬂuctuations of the
objects’ polarisation and of the electromagnetic ﬁeld [3].
In particular, the term Casimir–Polder force is commonly
used to refer to the dispersion interaction between a mi-
croscopic object such as an atom or a molecule and a
macroscopic body [4].

Shortly after Casimir’s seminal work, it was found by
Boyer that the force between a perfectly conducting plate
and an inﬁnitely permeable one is repulsive [5]. Mathe-
matically, this is due to the diﬀerent boundary conditions
that electric vs magnetic mirrors place on the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld [6]: the force depends on the product of
the reﬂection coeﬃcients of the two plates and is hence
attractive for two electric or two magnetic mirrors and
repulsive for two mirrors of diﬀerent type. Repulsive dis-
persion forces have been predicted for a variety of sce-
narios involving a polarisable and a magnetisable object
[7–10], including the Casimir–Polder force between an
atom and a plate [11–14]. While the attractive Casimir–
Polder force between a polarisable atom and a perfect
electric mirror is a straightforward consequence of the
attractive alignment of the ﬂuctuating atomic dipole mo-
ment and its image [15], an understanding of the repul-
sion for mixed electric–magnetic object combinations re-

quires dynamical considerations. As explicitly shown for
the case of two atoms, an oscillating electric dipole gen-
erates a magnetic ﬁeld which orients a nearby magnetic
dipole such that a repulsive force emerges [16, 17].

The study of repulsive dispersion forces is motivated
by the hope that these could help overcome the prob-
lem of stiction in nanotechnology [18]. Theoretical stud-
ies have unearthed three mechanisms by which repulsion
can be achieved, two of which have been veriﬁed experi-
mentally: (i) Two bodies immersed in a liquid repel each
other when one of them is more optically thin and the
other more optically thick than the medium [19], the ef-
fect being analogous to an air bubble in water experi-
encing ‘repulsive gravity’. (ii) Non-equilibrium systems
such as non-uniform temperatures [20] or excited atoms
in a low-temperature environment [21] may experience
repulsion, which is analogous to the force that an os-
cillating dipole exerts on an second, out-of-phase dipole
of lower eigenfrequency.
(iii) The mentioned repulsion
due to magnetic properties has proven elusive so far, be-
cause for materials existing in nature it is typically over-
whelmed by the ever-present attractive electric–electric
force [10]. Attempts to overcome this problem via artiﬁ-
cial metamaterials [9, 22, 23] have been demonstrated to
fail due to an Earnshaw no-go theorem [24].

Here, we propose a system that is free from such
constraints, because one of the interacting partners—a
neutron—is purely magnetic. While electrically neutral
and non-polar, the neutron does exhibit a magnetic mo-
ment which may interact with the quantum electrody-
namic ﬁeld. As we will argue, the neutron with its spin
eigenstates can be viewed as a magnetisable two-level sys-
tem which will experience a repulsive force of Casimir–
Polder type when interacting with a metal or dielectric
wall.

Evidence for interactions of neutrons with walls has
been found within the context of neutron interferometry.

FIG. 1: Setup: Neutron in front of an inﬁnite metal or di-
electric plate. To lift the degeneracy of the two neutron spin
states, an external magnetic ﬁeld is applied in a direction n(ϑ)
which is at an angle ϑ with respect to the surface normal.

In particular, by introducing a stack of narrow slits into
one arm of such an interferometer, a conﬁnement-induced
phase shift has been found [25]. Here, the plates forming
the slits provide rigid boundary conditions for the neu-
tron wave function. This is in contrast to our proposed
long-range Casimir–Polder interaction which should be
felt by the entire neutron wave function within such slits.
The article is organised a follows: we begin by describ-
ing the proposed setup of a neutron in front of a metal
or dielectric surface and introduce the basic formalism of
macroscopic quantum electrodynamics used to describe
the surface-assisted magnetic ﬁeld. We then derive the
Casimir–Polder force on the neutron using second-order
perturbation theory. Finally, we quantify the resulting
neutron–plate interaction for diﬀerent substrate materi-
als and compare it to gravitational potentials.

Setup and basic equations. As illustrated in Fig. 1,
we consider a single neutron at position rN, which is
at a distance z from a homogeneous metal or dielectric
plate of electric permittivity ε(ω) which is inﬁnitely thick
and inﬁnitely extended in the lateral dimensions (semi-
inﬁnite half space).

In order to obtain the Casimir–Polder potential of
the neutron, we separate the Hamiltonian into the free
Hamiltonians of the neutron and the medium-assisted
electromagnetic ﬁeld on one side and the interaction
Hamiltonian on the other. We treat the latter as a per-
turbation. The free ﬁeld Hamiltonian is given by [26]

Here, ˆf †(r, ω) are bosonic creation operators of eﬀective
medium–ﬁeld excitations.

We apply an external (classical) magnetic ﬁeld Bext =
Bextn in order to split the energies of the two neutron
spin states.
Its directional unit vector n is at an an-
gle ϑ with respect to the unit normal of the plate. The
resulting Hamiltonian of the free neutron reads

a typical atom, which is due to the smallness of the ﬁne

and the small electron-to-neutron mass ratio (accounting

Discussion.

In an experiment, applied magnetic ﬁelds
are typically Bext . 5T, such that the critical dis-
tance znret = c/ω↑↓ = c/(γnBext) & 0.32 m for the non-
retarded limit is much larger than typical distances in ex-
periments which vary from nm to µm. We have z ≪ znret,
such that we ﬁnd ourselves in the non-retarded limit. For
all practical cases, we can hence expand the potential to
leading order of the external magnetic ﬁeld. The results
are summarised in Tab. I. For the perfect conductor and
the plasma model, the potential persists even of vanish-
ing external magnetic ﬁeld. For the two other models
instead, the potential is linear in the applied magnetic
ﬁeld.

We note that the diﬀerent models lead to a variety of
asymptotic power laws for the distance dependence. For

instance, it is seen that the perfect-conductor limit does
not commute with the nonretarded limit for the plasma
model, in contrast to the case of the atomic Casimir–
Polder potential [29]. In addition, there are marked dif-
ferences between the plasma and Drude models, mak-
ing this interaction a new and sensitive test case for the
Drude–plasma debate in Casimir physics [30, 31]. Ul-
timately, the strong model-dependence of the neutron
Casimir–Polder potential stems from its mixed electric-
magnetic interaction in a short-distance regime, which is
analogous to the case of the anomalous magnetic moment
of the electron [32].

Finally, let us discuss whether the potentials predicted
for the diﬀerent models are in principle detectable in
an experiment. To that end, we compare them with
the gravitational potential exerted on the neutron by
the same plate and by earth, respectively.
In Fig. 3
the neutron Casimir–Polder potential at accessible dis-
tance regimes is shown for the diﬀerent models along-
side these two gravitational potentials. To estimate the
gravitational ﬁeld of the surface, we have for simplic-
ity used a silicon sphere (density ρ = 2.33 g/cm3) of ra-
dius r = 11.3 mm whose mass is comparable to that of
a plate in a typical neutron interferometry experiment
[25]. The magnitude of the Casimir-Polder potential is
highly model-dependent. While it is generally weaker
than the gravitational potential of earth (except for the
perfect-conductor case), it is for all models stronger than
the gravitational potential of the plate itself. It should
hence be taken into account when performing short-range
gravity experiments with neutrons.

Conclusions. We have shown that a single neutron
under the inﬂuence of a constant magnetic ﬁeld will be
subject to a Casimir–Polder-type dispersion interaction
with a metal or dielectric plate. This is an example of
Casimir repulsion for a magnetisable object interacting
with a polarisable one where the repulsion is not domi-
nated by an electric–electric force. We have found that
the force is non-retarded for experimentally accessible
regimes and that it is very sensitive to the electric re-
