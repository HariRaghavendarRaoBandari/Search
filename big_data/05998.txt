ABSTRACT

We present the results of a precise near-infrared (NIR) radial velocity (RV) survey of 32 low-mass stars with
spectral types K2–M4 using CSHELL at the NASA IRTF in the K-band with an isotopologue methane gas
cell to achieve wavelength calibration and a novel iterative RV extraction method. We surveyed 14 members
of young (≈ 25–150 Myr) moving groups, the young ﬁeld star ε Eridani as well as 18 nearby (< 25 pc) low-
mass stars and achieved typical single-measurement precisions of 8–15 m s−1 with a long-term stability of
15–50 m s−1 over longer baselines. We obtain the best NIR RV constraints to date on 27 targets in our sample,
19 of which were never followed by high-precision RV surveys. Our results indicate that very active stars
can display long-term RV variations as low as ∼ 25–50 m s−1 at ≈ 2.3125 µm, thus constraining the effect of
jitter at these wavelengths. We provide the ﬁrst multi-wavelength conﬁrmation of GJ 876 bc and independently
retrieve orbital parameters consistent with previous studies. We recovered RV variability for HD 160934 AB
and GJ 725 AB that are consistent with their known binary orbits, and nine other targets are candidate RV
variables with a statistical signiﬁcance of 3–5σ. Our method combined with the new iSHELL spectrograph
will yield long-term RV precisions of (cid:46) 5 m s−1 in the NIR, which will allow the detection of Super-Earths near
the habitable zone of mid-M dwarfs.

1. INTRODUCTION

The method of Doppler radial velocity (RV) variations has
proven itself fruitful in the last decades both for the identiﬁ-
cation of new exoplanets (e.g., Mayor & Queloz 1995; Marcy
et al. 1998; Delfosse et al. 1998a; Marcy et al. 2001; Cochran

et al. 2002; Endl et al. 2003; Butler et al. 2004; Rivera et al.
2005b, 2010; Meschiari et al. 2011; Dumusque et al. 2012;
Montet et al. 2014; Tuomi et al. 2014) and the conﬁrmation
of exoplanets detected by the method of transit (e.g. Kepler–
78b; Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2013; Pepe et al. 2013; Akeson et al.

2

2013). Recent developments have shown that cool ((cid:46) 3800 K)
stellar hosts in the M spectral class represent valuable targets
for the identiﬁcation of new Earth-mass planetary compan-
ions in the habitable zone with the RV method due to their
smaller mass and signiﬁcantly larger population (Henry et al.
2006).

However, it becomes gradually harder to obtain sufﬁcient
signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios at optical wavelengths at decreas-
ing effective temperatures (Reiners et al. 2010; Bottom et al.
2013). To worsen the case, late-type M dwarfs are on aver-
age more active and display more stellar spots (e.g., Shkol-
nik et al. 2009; Morin et al. 2010; Shkolnik et al. 2012; Malo
et al. 2014; Schmidt et al. 2015), which can induce RV signals
very similar to those of planetary companions (e.g., Queloz
et al. 2001; Paulson & Yelda 2005). Robertson et al. (2014)
demonstrated the importance of a careful consideration of
stellar activity in exoplanet searches by demonstrating that
the purported GJ 581 d habitable-zone exoplanet (Udry et al.
2007) was most likely a false-positive signal caused by stel-
lar spots. Overcoming this limitation is especially important
in the search for very low-mass companions that induce RV
variations of low amplitudes (e.g. a few m s−1) comparable to
stellar activity jitter.

The study of RV variations in the regime of near-infrared
(NIR) wavelengths addresses both these issues. First, a larger
fraction of the ﬂux of cooler ((cid:46) 3850 K), later-type ((cid:38) M0;
Pecaut & Mamajek 2013) host stars is emitted at these wave-
lengths, although care must be used in choosing the observed
NIR wavelength range for M0–M4 dwarfs as their lack of
spectral features can counterbalance the brightness advantage
(Reiners et al. 2010).
Secondly and perhaps more importantly, the RV signal in-
duced by stellar spots is expected to have an ≈ λ−1 depen-
dence for modest spot contrast temperatures, where λ is the
wavelength (Reiners et al. 2010; Anglada-Escudé et al. 2012;
Howard et al. 2013; Pepe et al. 2013; Plavchan et al. 2015;
Marchwinski et al. 2015), which means that the effect of stel-
lar spots on NIR RV measurements is less important than it
is at visible wavelengths by a factor ∼ 4. However, there
have also been predictions that the Zeeman effect result-
ing from the strong magnetic activity in young stars could
cause jitter to increase as a function of wavelength (Rein-
ers et al. 2013). Furthermore, the RV signal induced on a
stellar host by a substellar companion via the Doppler ef-
fect is wavelength-independent, hence a multi-wavelengths
RV follow-up opens the possibility of rejecting exoplanet can-
didates that are caused by other astrophysical phenomena that
would cause RV variations of different amplitudes in the op-
tical and NIR regimes.

RV surveys in the NIR are still trailing behind their opti-
cal counterparts in terms of long-term RV stability, with best
reported NIR results at ≈ 5 m s−1 (Bean et al. 2010) using 8 m-
class telescopes, or ≈ 45–60 m s−1 (Blake et al. 2010; Crock-
ett et al. 2011; Tanner et al. 2012; Bailey et al. 2012) using

smaller facilities, versus 0.8–15 m s−1 in the optical (Cochran
& Hatzes 1994; Kürster et al. 1994; Endl et al. 2006; Mayor
& Udry 2008; Howard et al. 2010b; Dumusque et al. 2012).
This is mainly due to the presence of stronger telluric absorp-
tion features in the NIR (Seifahrt et al. 2010; Blake et al.
2010; Blake & Shaw 2011; Plavchan et al. 2015), and tech-
nical challenges , given that NIR instrumentation and observ-
ing methods have only been developed relatively recently. As
an example, iodine gas cells, which have been used exten-
sively as wavelength calibrators in optical RV surveys, do not
offer a sufﬁcient density of absorption lines in the NIR do-
main. For this reason, most existing NIR RV studies have
used telluric lines to achieve wavelength calibration (Blake
et al. 2010; Crockett et al. 2011; Bailey et al. 2012; Tanner
et al. 2012; Davison et al. 2015), with the exception of Bean
et al. (2010) who used an ammonia gas cell with CRIRES
at the VLT to obtain unprecedented long-term precisions of
≈ 5–10 m s−1 in the NIR on targets with KS-band magnitudes
between 4.4 and 8.0.

Our team has recently developed a methane isotopologue
gas cell that offers a high absorption line density in the NIR
regime to achieve RV measurements of the order of a few
m s−1 with the limited spectral grasp of CSHELL at the NASA
InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF; Anglada-Escudé et al.
2012; Plavchan et al. 2013), as well as an iterative algorithm
that allows for the simultaneous solving of the wavelength so-
lution, the construction of an empirical stellar spectrum and
the measurement of stellar RVs (P. Gao et al., submitted to
PASP). In this paper, we present the results of a NIR RV
survey of 32 late-type, nearby stars using CSHELL at the
IRTF using this new RV extraction pipeline. We achieve
long-term single-measurement high-S/N RV precisions of
≈ 8 m s−1 within a single night and ≈ 15 m s−1 over long-term
baselines up to several years, which represents a substantial
improvement over previously reported single-measurements
precisions using CSHELL and no gas cell (e.g., 58 m s−1
within a single night; Crockett et al. 2011; or 90 m s−1 on
baselines of several years; Davison et al. 2015).

In Section 2, we present the method by which we con-
structed our target sample. The observing setup and strategy
is then detailed in Section 3. We summarize the spectral ex-
traction method and the RV measurement algorithm in Sec-
tions 4 and 5, respectively. The method by which we combine
individual RV measurements is presented in Section 6. Our
global survey results are then presented in Section 7, and we
discuss individual targets in Section 8. We ﬁnally present our
conclusions in Section 9.

2. SAMPLE SELECTION

Our survey sample is composed of two parts; the ﬁrst con-
sists of nearby, young stars mostly selected from known mem-
bers of young moving groups, and the second consists of
nearby (< 25 pc) stars of any age. Comparing our results
with those of optical RV surveys for the young sample will

eventually allow us to characterize how the signature of stel-
lar activity on RV curves differ between these two wave-
length regimes, whereas completing the census of giant close-
in planets in a volume-limited sample will be useful to derive
population statistics in the near future. In this Section, we de-
scribe the process by which these samples were constructed.
The complete survey sample is presented in Table 1 and a
spectral types histogram of it is presented in Figure 1.

2.1. The Young Sample

The young sample was constructed by selecting K- to
mid M-type young stars in the solar neighborhood, mainly
from known members of young moving groups, such as
β Pictoris (24 ± 3 Myr; Zuckerman et al. 2001; Bell et al.
2015a), AB Doradus (149+51
−19 Myr; Zuckerman et al. 2004;
Bell et al. 2015a) and the Octans-Near association (≈ 30–
100 Myr; Zuckerman et al. 2013), with 2MASS KS-band mag-
nitudes brighter than 7.1 (the brightest target ε Eridani has
KS = 1.8) so that a S/N of ∼ 80 could be achieved within ap-
proximately an hour. The young age of all stars in this sam-
ple is strongly constrained by kinematic membership to these
young associations, typically in addition to lithium abundance
measurements and/or comparison to isochrones (e.g., Torres
et al. 2008), except for the star ε Eridani, which is not a mem-
ber of any known young moving group. In this case, the age
is constrained to 400–800 Myr by Mamajek & Hillenbrand
(2008).

No selection cut was applied on projected rotational veloci-
ties; all stars in this sample have measured vsini values in the
literature ranging from 2 to 70 km s−1 . All < 2" binaries were
rejected from the sample, except for GJ 3305 AB (0.(cid:48)(cid:48)093;
Kasper et al. 2007) and HD 160934 AB (0.(cid:48)(cid:48)12; Gálvez et al.
2006), which were not known to be binary stars at the time
when the young sample was assembled. A total of 15 targets
were selected and are listed in Table 1, with spectral types
ranging from K2 to M4.

Six targets in the young sample had never beneﬁtted from
a precise RV follow-up. Six others were already followed ei-
ther at optical or NIR wavelengths albeit at a (cid:38) 50 m s−1 pre-
cision (AG Tri, AT Mic A, AT Mic B, AU Mic, BD+01 2447,
V1005 Ori; Bailey et al. 2012; Paulson & Yelda 2006), and
three targets beneﬁtted from a precise RV follow-up at opti-
cal wavelengths (BD+20 1790, ε Eridani, GJ 3305 AB; e.g.,
Figueira et al. 2010; Hernán-Obispo et al. 2015; Campbell
et al. 1988; Elliott et al. 2014).

There are a total of 3/15 (20%) targets in the young sam-
ple that have a projected rotational velocity smaller than
∼ 3 km s−1, which seems unexpected for young stars (i.e. such
slow rotators have been shown to be typically older than a few
hundred Myr; Irwin et al. 2011; Reiners & Mohanty 2012).
We suggest that projection effects could explain this, e.g. 20%
of stars with a random inclination i would have a projected ro-
tational velocities three times smaller or less than their actual
rotational velocities (i.e., sini ≤ 0.31).

Figure 1. Spectral type histogram of the nearby and young tar-
get samples that were studied in this work. Targets that fall
into both samples are shown in both histograms (and thus ap-
pear twice). For more details, see Section 2

2.2. The Nearby Sample

The nearby sample was constructed by selecting all M
dwarfs from the Reserach Consortium on Nearby Stars (RE-
CONS; Henry et al. 2014) and the Lépine and Shara Proper
Motion (LSPM) catalog (Lépine 2005) with a trigonometric
distance measurement that places them within 25 pc of the
Sun. We avoided including targets that were already part of
precise RV follow-up programs, such as the Hobble-Eberly
Telescope survey (HET; Endl et al. 2003, 2006), the Califor-
nia Planet Survey (CPS; Howard et al. 2010a; Montet et al.
2014), and the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph
re-analysis of Tuomi et al. (2014). We selected the targets
that are easily accessible from the IRTF (−35° < DEC < 65°)
with apparent 2MASS magnitudes KS < 6.4. We used a more
conservative KS-band cut in this sample to achieve a S/N of at
least 200 per pixel within a few hours (see Section 3).

All targets with a known stellar companion or a background
star at < 2" were rejected from the sample. We obtained pro-
jected rotational velocities (vsini) from the literature when
available and rejected targets with vsini ≥ 20 km s−1. From
this initial list of targets, we followed 21 low-mass stars with
spectral types in the M0–M4 range, which are listed in Ta-
ble 1. All of these targets have rotational velocity measure-
ments in the literature, which range from 3 to 16 km s−1. It
can be noted that 4 targets are present in both the nearby and
young samples.

Fourteen targets in the nearby sample never had precise RV
follow-up observations. Five targets were already followed at
NIR wavelengths albeit at a (cid:38) 50 m s−1 precision (AT Mic A,
AT Mic B, AU Mic, EV Lac and GJ 725 A; Bailey et al. 2012),
and two other targets beneﬁtted from a precise RV follow-up
at optical wavelengths (GJ 15 A and GJ 876; e.g., Delfosse
et al. 1998a; Marcy et al. 1998; Rivera et al. 2010; Howard
et al. 2014).

Both the HET and CPS catalogs used similar selection cri-

teria with the exception that young and/or chromospherically
active systems were rejected. Thus, we are subject to a bias
towards these systems despite our rejection of high-vsini tar-
gets. One target in the sample (GJ 740) has been followed
as part of the HARPS survey (Bonﬁls et al. 2013), but no re-
sults were published at the time the target list was assembled,
hence we have included it in the sample.

We ﬂag chromospheric activity in Table 1 based on
logR(cid:48)
HK index values from the literature, when available (e.g.,
see Zirker 1968; Noyes et al. 1984.) We assume a mea-
surement error of 5% in the case of LO Peg, since Gray
et al. (2003) do not report one. Nine objects have no avail-
able logR(cid:48)
HK index but have a measurement for the alterna-
tive SHK index that also traces chromospheric activity.
In
these cases, we used the relation of Middelkoop (1982) and
Noyes et al. (1984) to translate it into a value for logR(cid:48)
HK.
Using Figure 1 of Middelkoop (1982)1, we calculated that
this relation is associated with an uncertainty of ∼ 0.057 dex,
which is larger than typical measurement errors on SHK them-
In a few cases where the B − V color of a target is

redder than the color range where the relation has been tested
(0.45 ≤ B − V ≤ 1.5), we display the value between paren-
theses in Table 1. We use the classiﬁcation of Gray et al.

HK > −4.2 as very ac-
tive (VA), those with −4.2 > logR(cid:48)

those with −4.75 > logR(cid:48)
HK > −5.1 as inactive (I), and those
with logR(cid:48)

HK < −5.1 as very inactive (VI).

3. OBSERVATIONS

We obtained our data using the NIR high resolution single-
order echelle spectrograph CSHELL (Greene et al. 1993;
Tokunaga et al. 1990) at the 3 m IRTF from 2010 October
to 2015 January. The survey presented here includes a total
of 3794 individual spectra obtained within a total of 65 ob-
serving nights. We used the 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 slit and the continuous vari-
able ﬁlter2, yielding a resolving power of R = 46000 (Crock-
ett et al. 2011; Prato et al. 2015) with a spectral grasp of
≈ 5.55 nm at 2.3125 µm.
It is noteworthy to mention that
Davison et al. 2015 measured a resolving power as high as
R = 57000 with the 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 slit from modelling observed absorp-
tion telluric lines and suggested that this could be due to the
slit being slightly narrower than its designation. The spectro-
graph uses a ≈ 25 yr-old 256x256 pixels InSb detector that
has a signiﬁcant number of bad pixels compared to more re-
cent NIR detectors.

A 13CH4 isotopologue methane gas cell (Anglada-Escudé
et al. 2012; Plavchan et al. 2013) was inserted in the shutter
beam to provide a wavelength reference in the NIR. The gas
cell temperature is stabilized at 10.0± 0.1◦ Celsius, which is
adequate to keep it stable at better than the ∼ 1 m s−1 level

(Anglada-Escudé et al. 2012; Plavchan et al. 2013). The grat-
ing angle was set once at the beginning of each night by ob-
serving an A-type star and ensuring that the deep methane
absorption line of the gas cell at ≈ 2.31355 µm was located
on column 179 of the detector to achieve identical wavelength
coverage, as the position of the deep methane feature typically
varied by ∼ 1–2 detector pixels between observing nights.
This setup typically corresponded to central wavelength val-
ues of ≈ 2.31255 µm.

We obtained science exposures of 300 s or less to avoid
saturation or signiﬁcant background variations, and obtained
several exposures (typically ∼ 5–60) to achieve a combined
S/N of ∼ 70 to 200 depending on the survey sample. We did
not obtain pair-subtracted spectra as our targets are signiﬁ-
cantly brighter than background sky emission, and all spectra
were obtained with the methane gas cell in beam.

Starting in 2014, we systematically observed one bright A-
type star (either Sirius, Castor, Vega, Alphecca, β Arietis or
32 Pegasi depending on their altitude) at the beginning of ev-
ery night to obtain a S/N≈ 200 spectrum of the gas cell and
characterize any potential long-term variation. Fifteen ﬂat-
ﬁeld exposures of 15 s were initially obtained at the begin-
ning of every night, however starting from 2014 April 2, we
obtained ﬁfteen 15 s ﬂat-ﬁeld exposures after every science
target to minimize systematic instrumental effects. We did
not apply dark frame calibrations as we found that they did
not improve the quality of our results. A log of all observa-
tions obtained in this work is presented in Table 2, where S/N
values are calculated by assuming that the spectra are photon-
noise limited.

4. SPECTRAL EXTRACTION

Due to several challenges in extracting RVs out of CSHELL
spectra, we constructed our own custom data reduction
pipeline to extract the 3794 spectra obtained in this work in
a consistent way. We summarize below this data extraction
pipeline, which is described in more details in P. Gao et al.
(submitted to PASP).

Per-target ﬂat ﬁelds were generated by median-combining
data sets that each consist of 15 individual ﬁles. 2D sinusoidal
fringing with amplitude ∼ 0.2–0.6% was found to be present
in these ﬂat ﬁelds due to the CSHELL circular variable ﬁl-
ter, which limited our long-term RV precision to > 55 m s−1
when left uncorrected. Fringing subtraction was thus achieved
by median-combining a large number of per-target ﬂat ﬁelds
spanning several years to obtain a master ﬂat ﬁeld. This aver-
aged out the fringing due to its spatial and spectral variations
over time. Individual per-target ﬂat ﬁelds were then normal-
ized by the master ﬂat ﬁeld to bring out their fringing pattern,
which was ﬁtted and corrected individually .

Fringing is also present in the science observations, but sim-
ilar efforts to correct fringing were not possible due to low il-
lumination of most of the image aside from the spectral trace
of the target. Thus, we removed this fringing in the RV ex-
traction process.

Spectral extraction was performed by ﬁrst dividing the
fringing-corrected, per-target ﬂat ﬁelds from the science ob-
servations, followed by correcting for a linear tilt in the target
trace on the detector. A Moffat proﬁle was then ﬁt to the trace
in the spatial direction, and the 1D spectrum was extracted us-
ing the median trace proﬁle with an optimal extraction proce-
dure (Horne 1986; Massey & Hanson 2013). Following this,
a synthetic spectral trace was constructed from the extracted
spectrum and the spatial proﬁle and was divided out from
the observed spectral trace. The 2D residuals resulting from
this operation were combed for large deviations from the me-
dian, which were ﬂagged as bad pixels. A 1D spectrum was
extracted again from the spectral trace after having masked
these bad pixels. Additional bad pixels were ﬂagged by not-
ing any major deviations from the continuum in the ﬁnal 1D
spectra, in order for them to be ignored by the RV extraction
pipeline.

5. RADIAL VELOCITY EXTRACTION

We used a novel forward modelling MATLAB RV pipeline
to compute the relative RV of every individual spectrum,
which we summarize in this section. The pipeline is de-
scribed in detail by P. Gao et al. (submitted to PASP), who
demonstrate that it allows for the construction of a stellar
template simultaneously to gas cell observations, and prop-
erly accounts for the signiﬁcant telluric features in the NIR.
Using this pipeline with CSHELL/IRTF data, they achieve a
RV precision of ∼ 3 m s−1 over a few days using photon-noise
limited observations of the M-type giant SV Peg.

The pipeline extracts the RVs associated with a spectrum
by ﬁtting a forward spectral model to the observed data. The
forward model consists of: an empirical telluric transmis-
sion spectrum Tλ (Livingston & Wallace 1991) where λ is
the wavelength measured at rest and in vacuum; a measured
isotopologue methane gas cell spectrum Gλ (Plavchan et al.
2013) that has been obtained from the NASA Jet Propulsion
Laboratory (JPL) and corrected using high-S/N observations
of A-type telluric standards; a line spread function (LSF) L
that models broadening and distortions in the spectral line
proﬁle due to both instrumental and atmospheric effects and
that is represented by a weighted sum of the ﬁrst 5 terms of
the Hermite function (i.e., a normal distribution multiplied
by Hermite polynomials, see Arfken et al. 2012) where the
weights are free parameters; a quadratic curve Bλ that models
the instrumental Blaze function and variations in the NIR sky
background; and an instrumental fringing term φλ that is rep-
resented by a multiplicative sinusoid function. The forward
model Fλ is then given by :

Fλ = (Gλ · Tλ · Sλ · Bλ · φλ)⊗ L,

(1)

where Sλ is an estimated stellar spectrum of the target in the
absence of a gas cell, and ⊗ represents a convolution. The
forward model Fλ must then be Doppler-shifted to account
for the relative line-of-sight velocity of the target with respect
to an observer on the Earth. This is done by applying a lin-

ear shift to Fλ by a factor(cid:0)W /c(cid:1) in logarithmic wavelength

space, where c is the speed of light and W is the combined
contributions from the RV signal of the target and the motion
of the Earth relative to the target. Fλ is ﬁnally mapped to the
detector pixels using a two-degrees polynomial mapping rela-
tion. The forward model is ﬁt to the data using a Nelder-Mead
downhill simplex algorithm (Nelder & Mead 1965), which is
especially useful in this situation where the number of free
parameters (17) is relatively large.

A difﬁculty in using this method is the apparent need of
measuring the stellar spectrum Sλ, since it would require ob-
taining high-S/N spectra for every target with the methane gas
cell out of beam. This would be problematic, as moving the
methane gas cell in and out of beam will affect the wavelength
solution of the observed spectrum. The stellar template thus
needs to be measured simultaneously as the RV data is col-
lected. The algorithm addresses this need, using only obser-
vations obtained with the gas cell in beam, by: (1) performing
a ﬁrst ﬁt with Sλ = 1 ∀ λ; (2) identifying deep CO lines in the
residuals of the best ﬁt; (3) repeating step 1 with the CO lines
masked to obtain a better solution given that CO lines are not
yet included in the stellar template Sλ; (4) constructing a stel-
lar spectrum from a weighted linear combination of the de-
convolved ﬁtting residuals of all individual spectra for a given
science target in the stellar rest frame; and (5) repeating step
4 up to 20 times, adding the residuals back into the best esti-
mated stellar spectrum at every iteration. The deconvolution
of the residuals is computer-intensive and only signiﬁcantly

A HIGH-PRECISION NIR SURVEY FOR RV VARIABLE LOW-MASS STARS

beneﬁts the ﬁrst iteration, hence it was only performed at the
ﬁrst iteration. It is important to note that all RVs measured
with this algorithm are relative, since they are measured with
respect to the stellar template that was constructed from all of
the data themselves.

It can be noted that combining all observations to create
the stellar template does not account for any variability of
the star within the wavelength range that we observe. This
is not problematic for the targets in our sample since they do
not show signiﬁcant temporal variations in their spectral mor-
phology, however stars that vary signiﬁcantly such as SV Peg
(e.g., M. Bottom et al., in preparation) would need to be re-
duced in several individual steps of smaller temporal coverage
to account for the varying stellar spectrum.
The quality of the ﬁt typically increased for a few iterations
(typically (cid:46) 10), until noise started to dominate the residuals
that are added to the stellar spectrum. The best-ﬁt parameters
of the iteration where the RV scatter is minimized were then
preserved as the true solution to the ﬁt, and the barycentric-
corrected RVs were calculated from W using barycentric cor-
rections that were computed a priori for every science expo-
sure with the barycentric_vel.pro IDL routine.
Since the
stellar spectrum is not modelled, this analysis does not allow
for a measurement of the projected stellar rotational velocity.

6. THE COMBINATION OF RV MEASUREMENTS
The algorithm described in Section 5 yields an individual
RV measurement νi for every spectrum i that corresponds to a
single exposure on a given science target. These RV measure-
ments are relative in the sense that they are computed with
respect to the stellar template, which is built from the data
themselves. The Nelder-Mead downhill simplex algorithm
does not provide error measurements on the best-ﬁt param-
eters, however the general quality of the forward model can
be assessed from σRi, the standard deviation of the residuals
(Ri) of the best ﬁt to the spectrum in question, with bad pixels
ignored.

Since we aim at reaching high S/N ratios and at detect-
ing variability on timescales of more than several hours, we
combined all science exposures obtained within a given night
(typically ∼ 5–60), using a weighted mean that is designed to
minimize the impact of low-quality data:

¯νk =

,

(2)

where the weight factors are deﬁned as wi = σ−2
Ri . ¯νk thus rep-
resents the mean RV within observing night k. We deﬁne the
measurement error that is associated with this quantity as a
weighted standard deviation of the individual RV measure-
ments obtained in this night:

(cid:80)

(3)

where Nexp is the total number of exposures obtained within

(cid:80)
i wi νi(cid:80)

i wi

the observing night.

There are a few quantities that are interesting to calculate
for every RV curve, in the sense that they can shed light on
the typical precision and on the possibility that a target is an
RV variable source. The most straightforward of those is the
weighted standard deviation of the per-night RVs:

ς2 =

,

(4)

(cid:80)
k(cid:80)
k w(cid:48)
k ¯ν2
k w(cid:48)
k

where we use the ς symbol to distinguish this quantity from
σk. We use the optimal weight factors w(cid:48)
k that correspond to
the inverse of the variance of a per-night RV measurement:

w(cid:48)
k = σ−2
k .

(5)

k,max =(cid:0)15m s−1(cid:1)−2, which corresponds to

In order to avoid an artiﬁcial over-weighting of RV points
that have a very small σk, which happens from time to time
when the number of exposures is very low, we deﬁne a max-
imum weight of w(cid:48)
the weight that one RV data point would have at the typical
single-measurement precision values that we obtain for high-
S/N observations.

Another quantity of interest is the reduced chi-square χ2

r of
an RV curve with respect to a zero-variation curve, given by:

Nk(cid:88)

k=1

χ2
r =

Nk − 1

¯ν2

(6)

where Nk is the number of nights where a given target was ob-
served, and the denominator Nk −1 corresponds to the number
of degrees of freedom to the RV curve (we subtract one ﬁtted
parameter corresponding to the ﬂoating relative RV). Targets
with a higher χ2
r value will be more likely to be true RV vari-
able sources.
In an ideal case where all per-night RV measurements have
the same intrinsic RV precision σk = S ∀ k, it can be shown
from the previous equations that:

(cid:18) Nk

(cid:19)

Nk − 1

S2 = ς2
χ2
r

.

(7)

We will refer to this quantity S as the single-measurement
precision; it is not affected by the fact that a given source is an
RV variable as long as it is only variable on timescales larger
than a few hours (otherwise σk would be partly composed of a
variability term). For the sake of being able to compare all of
our targets in a single ς2–χ2
r plane, we will make the following
approximation:

S2 ≈ ς2
χ2
r

,

(8)

which would normally only be valid for large values of Nk.
We can bring out another interesting measurement by making
the supposition that the scatter ς of a given RV curve is due
to only two uncorrelated sources: a physical RV variability
V and an instrumental error term corresponding to the single-

measurement precision S. It immediately follows that:

Table 3. Detailed Radial Velocity Measurements

We deﬁne another quantity Nς:

which will be used in the following sections to assess the sta-
tistical signiﬁcance of the RV variability V of our targets.

One last quantity of interest is Vmax, the maximal admis-
sible RV variability on the timescales that we probed given
our RV measurements, at a statistical signiﬁcance of Nς. If
we assume that the probability density function N (ν) asso-
ciated with the RV variability measurement that we obtained
for a target is a normal distribution centered on V and with a
characteristic width S, a simplistic estimate for the maximal
admissible RV variability would be Vmax = V + NςS such that:

where erf(x) is the error function. However, since negative
RV variabilities are unphysical, the normal probability density
function must be set to zero for all negative RV values. We
must thus identify the value for Vmax that ensures:

7. SURVEY RESULTS

We present in this section the resulting NIR RV measure-
ments that we obtained for the two survey samples described
in Section 2 using our novel RV extraction method. Global
results of this survey are described in Section 7.1 , and up-
per limits on the projected masses of possible companions to
our targets are derived in Section 7.2. We discuss the effect
of rotational velocity and stellar activity in Section 7.3, and
discuss bi-sector measurements in Section 7.4.

7.1. Ensemble Results

The 248 individual per-night RV measurements (¯νk, σk) and
epochs that were accumulated in this survey are listed in Ta-
ble 3, and the associated RV curves are presented in Figures 2
through 5. The dominant cause of the variation in error bars
for the per-night RVs presented in these ﬁgures is the varying
S/N ratios most often associated with weather or a varying
number of total spectra.
We achieved short-term RV precisions (within a single
night) as low as ∼ 8–15 m s−1 for higher-S/N observations,

In Table 4, we present the distributions of ς, χ2

which represents a net improvement over previous studies that
used similar small facilities (e.g., ≈ 45–90 m s−1; Bailey et al.
2012; Davison et al. 2015), but that did not beneﬁt from a
methane gas cell or our novel RV extraction method . These
precisions are almost comparable to what is achieved using
8 m-class telescopes with a spectral grasp ∼ 10 times larger,
although we can only achieve similar S/N on brighter targets
(e.g., 5–10 m s−1 on targets with 4.4 < KS < 8.0; Bean et al.
2010).

The methane gas cell and RV extraction method that we used
allowed us to achieve long-term RV precisions of S ∼ 15–
50 m s−1, which represents an improvement of a factor (cid:38) 2
over similar NIR surveys that use small observing facilities.
It can be noted that we obtain χ2
r values above 1 for the ma-
jority of targets in our survey. This is expected, as the in-
strumental stability of CSHELL introduces a systematic RV
uncertainty on the combined RV measurements ¯νk that is not
captured by their error bars σk, which are determined from
the weighted standard deviation of single-exposure RV mea-
surements within one night (see Section 6). As a result, a χ2
r
value above one alone does not imply that a given target is
an RV variable. Hence, the survey targets must be compared
relative to one another in order to determine which ones are
most likely RV variables. It should also be noted that our sur-
vey is expected to have a larger number of RV variables than
a blind survey, as it is biased toward young and active stars

the relative zero-level, whereas the light blue region delimited by dash-dotted lines corresponds to a scatter of 15 m s−1, which
is similar to the best average single-measurement precisions that we achieve. Target names are displayed in the legends as well
as the total number of measurements Nk, the error-weighted reduced chi-square χ2
r with respect to a zero-variation curve, the
error-weighted standard deviation ς and the expected RV variability V (see Section 6 for detail). See Section 7 for a discussion
of the global survey results, and Section 8 for a discussion of individual targets

(see Section 2).

In Figures 6 and 7, we present the distribution of χ2

r and ς as
a function of the total number of epochs for all of our targets.
These ﬁgures bring out the absence of a correlation between
these quantities, an indication that no signiﬁcant long-term
systematics are affecting our survey results.

In Figure 8, we present the reduced χ2

r with respect to zero
RV variation as a function of the RV scatter ς for all of our
targets. This ﬁgure illustrates how the young survey sample
has been observed with a typically lower S/N, resulting in typ-
ical single-measurement precisions around 50 m s−1 on aver-

age, whereas those of the nearby sample are lower at around
15 m s−1. Targets located in the upper right of the ﬁgure (along
lines of constant single-measurement precisions), are the most
secure RV variables.

A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yields a 54% probability that
the reduced χ2
r values around zero RV variation for the young
and nearby samples are drawn from a single random distri-
bution (the nearby sample targets have slightly larger χ2
r val-
ues on average). This indicates a weak statistical signiﬁcance
that there is any fundamental difference in the RV variabil-
ity amplitude between the two samples. We recover a larger

fraction of candidate RV variable targets in the nearby sam-
ple (10/21 ≈ 48%) than in the young sample (4/15 ≈ 27%).
However, considering Poisson statistics and the number of tar-
gets in each sample, there is a relatively large ≈ 23% chance
that this discrepancy is due to pure chance. Both these results
could be explained by the fact that we obtained higher S/N
observations on average for the nearby sample, if we assume
that there is a larger number of RV variables with an ampli-
tude small enough so that they would not be detected in the
young sample (see Figure 8).

In Figure 9, we show the RV variability V as a function of
the single-measurement precision S and the statistical signif-
icance Nς of V . The ﬁrst distribution outlines the vastly dif-
ferent single-measurement precisions that were obtained for
the young and nearby samples, which is an effect of the dif-
ferent S/N observations. Targets located higher up in Panel b
of Figure 9 are the most probable RV variables, and those lo-
cated further to the right in the same ﬁgure could correspond
to more massive and/or close-in companions.
Nineteen of the targets presented in this work were never
part of a precise RV follow-up (S (cid:46) 100 m s−1) to date. There
are, however, 13 targets that already beneﬁtted from precise
RV monitoring. These targets are listed in Table 5, where
we compare the number of epochs, single-measurement pre-
cision and RV scatter of existing optical and NIR surveys to
our survey results. For eight of the targets listed in this table,

we present a more precise RV follow-up to those already pub-
lished, and for ﬁve of the targets, we present the ﬁrst precise
RV follow-up in the NIR. There is only one case (AT Mic B)
for which a NIR follow-up already existed at a better preci-
sion than the results presented here. These data do not allow
performing a signiﬁcant comparison between the level of RV
variability of single stars in the optical versus NIR; only three
such targets (BD+01 2447, GJ 15 A and ε Eridani) have pre-
cise RV measurements in both regimes, but they are consistent
within 1σ.

7.2. Constraints from Non-Detections

The upper limit measurements on RV variability Vmax de-
ﬁned in Equation (13) and listed in Table 4 can be translated
to upper limits on companion masses as a function of physical
separation or orbital period.

In order to estimate these upper limits, we have carried out
a 108–steps Monte Carlo simulation, where the orbital pa-
rameters of synthetic companions (projected companion mass
Mp sini, eccentricity e, period P, absolute RV γ, longitude of
periastron ω and periastron date T0) are drawn from a random
distribution.

In order to properly account for the eccentricity distribution
of known exoplanets, the random values for e are sampled
from a Beta distribution with a = 0.867 and b = 3.03 (Kipping
2013). P, Mp sini and T0 are drawn from uniform distributions

The χ2
r values do not seem to be correlated with the K-band magnitude, which indicates that our RV measurement errors are
realistic. The RV scatter ς is however correlated with the K-band magnitude, which is a natural effect of the lower S/N that were
obtained for fainter targets. The color scheme is identical to that of Figure 6. Targets in the young sample have lower S/N both
because they were observed with smaller integration times as they were mostly observed before 2014, but also because they have
fainter K-band magnitudes on average. For more details, see Section 7.1.

in log space, and γ is drawn from a normal distribution with
a standard deviation of V /2. This is done in order to reﬂect
our uncertainty on the absolute RV of our targets, especially
in the cases with only a few RV epochs.

Synthetic RV measurements are then extracted by sampling
the RV curve at the same epochs as our individual observa-
tions, and assigning the same measurement errors that we
have observed on each of them.

The synthetic RV variability term Vsynth is then calculated
for every synthetic companion, from which we derive a de-
tection probability according to its Nς distance from the mea-
sured V . This is done by ﬁnding the Nς value in Equa-
tion (11) that enforces Vmax
then be translated to a probability, assuming that the mea-
surement errors on V follow a normal distribution. A two-
dimensional 800x800-elements histogram is then constructed
over the variables (P, Mp sini) in logarithmic space, which
acts as a marginalization of the other orbital parameters. This
two-dimensional probability distribution is then converted
back to Nς values, which can be represented as a contour plot.
We display these contour plots in Figure 10, for the cases of
AU Mic and ε Eridani. The contour data have been smoothed
with a 2-pixels ﬁlter for visibility.

We deﬁne three regimes of periods P for which we de-
termine mean upper mass limits, i.e. Hot Jupiters (1–10 d),
Warm Jupiters (10–100 d) and Cool Jupiters (100–1000 d).
Within each one of these ranges, we determine the criti-
cal mass Mp sini at which 95% of the synthetic companions
would have been detected at a 3σ conﬁdence level. These val-
ues are reported in Table 4. These values do not allow us to

contradict the existence of any companion detection that was
previously reported in the literature.

7.3. Effects of Rotational Velocity and Age

To assess the impact of rotational broadening on our achiev-
able RV precision limit, we have constructed a set of syn-
thetic data based on our observations of GJ 15 A, which is
a slow-rotating, RV-quiet star (within our survey precision)
and beneﬁts from a large number of high-S/N observations.
We have used the best ﬁtting parameters that were obtained
from the RV pipeline for each individual raw spectrum to re-
move the effects of the blaze function, gas cell and telluric
absorption. We have then deconvolved the remaining indi-
vidual stellar spectra with the appropriate LSF and used the
add_rotation.pro IDL routine3 to produce an artiﬁcial rota-
tional broadening. We convolved the result with the LSF and
added back the effects of the gas cell, telluric absorption and
blaze function. We generated a synthetic data set in this way
for 18 values of projected rotational velocities vsini that range
from 2 to 30 km s−1.

These synthetic data sets were subsequently analyzed with
the MATLAB RV pipeline as described in Section 5. We show
in Figure 11(a) the resulting RV precision that was achieved
as a function of projected rotational velocity. As expected, the
RV precision starts decreasing when the projected rotational
velocity gets larger than the velocity resolution of CSHELL
(c/R ∼ 6.5 km s−1, where c is the speed of light in vacuum).

July 2003. Note that this routine is distinct from lsf_rotate.pro from the as-
trolib library at http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ that was recently shown to con-
tain an error (Messina et al. 2015).

This loss of RV precision follows a power law as a function
of vsini.

We have thus modelled this effect of vsini on the RV preci-
sion by using the quadrature sum of a constant term that repre-
sents the single-measurement precision, and a two-parameters
power law. The resulting ﬁtting function is given by :

y =

0 + (x/σx)2β,
y2

(15)

where y is the RV precision, x is the projected rotational
broadening, y0 is the RV scatter caused by all terms except ro-
tational broadening (e.g., single-measurement precision and
RV variability), and β and σx are the free parameters of the
power-law. We ﬁnd best-ﬁt values of σx = 1.56± 0.05 km s−1
and β = 1.70±0.02. The best-ﬁt solution is displayed as a red
curve in Figure 11(a).

In Figure 11(b), we compare this relation to our survey re-
sults, assuming different single-measurement precisions.

can be noted that in several cases with relatively low projected
rotational velocities (vsini (cid:46) 10 km s−1), we obtain RV preci-
sions that do not need to include a jitter term increasing with
vsini. It is however possible that a jitter term is the cause of
the lower RV precision that we obtain for a few targets located
above the 50 m s−1 single-measurement precision green solid
line.

The NIR jitter–vsini relation measured by Bailey et al.

(2012) for TW Hydrae members (10 ± 3 Myr; Bell et al.
2015b) is displayed as a grey dotted line in Figure 11(b). This
shows that the source for the RV variability of targets within
the grey region could be explained by jitter, if our targets dis-
play stellar spots as signiﬁcant as the young TW Hydrae pop-
ulation.

Such a level of jitter comparable to that of Bailey et al.
(2012) is not strong enough to reproduce the RV variabil-
ity of stars with known or candidate companions (GJ 876,
HD 160934 AB), as well as the single stars V577 Per,
BD+20 1790, and LHS 374. Those three targets display a
level of RV variability that is thus unlikely to be explained
by the combined loss of information due to stellar broadening
and stellar jitter, however additional follow-up will be needed
to assess this with certainty.

Survey targets that have a larger projected rotational veloc-
ity show larger RV variations, as expected. This correlation is
independent of the survey sample (i.e., independent of age),
although younger stars are faster rotators on average. It can
be noted that the large RV variability of LO Peg might be
explained by RV information loss due to the rotational broad-
ening of stellar lines, whereas that of EQ Peg A would require
a signiﬁcant jitter term at the higher end of what is admitted in
the relation proposed by Bailey et al. (2012). Further obser-
vations will be required to determine whether EQ Peg A can
plausibly host a substellar or planetary companion.

red line corresponds to a best-ﬁt power law (see Section 7.3). The blue line corresponds to the velocity resolution of a single
CSHELL spectrum (c/R ∼ 6.5 km s−1).
Panel b: RV variability V as a function of the measured projected rotational velocity vsini for the nearby (ﬁlled blue circles)
and young (red circles) samples. Upper limits are displayed with left-pointing arrows. The purple dash-dotted line represents the
effect of information loss from rotational velocity alone (extrapolated from the synthetic relation described in Section 7.3). The
dashed (solid) green line represents the quadrature sum of a 15 m s−1 (50 m s−1) single-measurement precision and information
loss from vsini. We display the quadrature sum of a 15 m s−1 single-measurement precision with the vsini–jitter relation of
Bailey et al. (2012) as a dotted grey line. It can be noted that the targets that we ﬂag as RV variables lie outside of the NIR jitter
region deﬁned by Bailey et al. (2012), which is an indication that their RV variability might not be due to stellar activity. For
more details, see Section 7.3.

HK as a function of RV vari-
ability V for our survey samples. The fact that
three very
active targets (logR(cid:48)
HK > − 4.2) display a low RV variability
of ∼ 25–50 m s−1 is a tentative indication for the level of NIR
RV jitter. See Section 7.3 for more details.

A fraction of the low vsini measurements that we have
compiled from the literature might be spurious, hence in these
cases simply comparing vsini to the RV variability term V is
not a reliable way to determine the source of RV variability
with certainty.

In Figure 12, we display RV variability as a function of
the logR(cid:48)
HK activity index. Targets in the young sample are
more active on average than those in the nearby sample, as
expected. The fact that we measure a relatively low RV vari-
ability for three very active targets (logR(cid:48)
HK > −4.2) provides
a tentative constraint on the level of jitter in the NIR to ∼ 25–
50 m s−1 at ≈ 2.3125 µm.

7.4. Bi-Sector Analysis

We measured the bi-sector slopes of CO lines in each of
our individual exposures (see e.g., Santos et al. 2001; Dravins
2008) to investigate the effect of stellar activity on our RV
variable targets. We did not identify a correlation between the
RV and bi-sector spans in any case.
However, it must be considered that the lack of a correlation
might be expected given the moderate resolution (R ≈ 46000)
of CSHELL and the observing setup that we have used (i.e.,
slit spectroscopy). Effectively, Desort et al. (2007) noted that
a poor sampling of spectral lines can hinder the measurements
of bi-sector spans; e.g. a resolution of R ≈ 50000 would
only be able to recover bisector span variations in targets with
vsini (cid:38) 6 km s−1. Slitless observations at higher resolutions
would thus be warranted to guarantee that the RV variability
that we measure are not associated with stellar activity.

8. DISCUSSION OF INDIVIDUAL TARGETS

8.1. RV Variable Targets

We deﬁne targets for which we measure an RV variability
with a statistical signiﬁcance of Nς ≥ 5 as likely RV variables,
and those with 3 ≤ Nς < 5 as candidate RV variables. All
targets that fall in these categories are discussed individually
in this section. More follow-up observations will be needed
to determine whether any RV variability is due to a compan-
ion or to stellar activity. Although it is generally expected
that the impact of stellar activity is small in the near-infrared
regime (Martín et al. 2006; Reiners et al. 2010), it has also
been shown by Reiners et al. (2013) that under certain conﬁg-
urations of stellar spots and magnetic ﬁelds, the effect of jitter
could in fact increase with wavelength.

GJ 876 (HIP 113020) is an M4 low-mass star (Reid et al.
1995; mass estimate 0.32 M(cid:12); Rivera et al. 2005b) located at
4.69± 0.05 pc (van Leeuwen 2007). Its low rotation rate and
weak magnetic activity suggest an age older than ∼ 0.1 Gyr.
Its kinematics place it in the young disk population (Correia
et al. 2010), however this does not put a strong constraint on
its age (i.e., (cid:46) 5 Gyr, Leggett 1992).
Using the proper motion (µα cos δ = 959.84±3.36 masyr−1;
µδ = −675.33± 1.68 masyr−1) and parallax measurements of
van Leeuwen (2007) along with the systemic RV measure-
ment of −1.59 ± 0.18 km s−1 (Nidever et al. 2002) with the
BANYAN II tool (Gagné et al. 2014; Malo et al. 2013), we
obtain a signiﬁcant probability (P = 85.1%) that this system
is a member of the β Pictoris moving group, which is com-
parable to its other bona ﬁde members (Gagné et al. 2014).
Its UVW space velocity and XY Z galactic position place it
at 5.05 ± 1.80 km s−1 and 13.3 ± 15.9 pc from the locus of
known β Pictoris moving group members. The probability
of a random interloper at such a spatial and kinematic dis-
tances from the locus of the group (counting both young and
old stars) is only of ≈ 1.3% (Gagné et al. 2014). However,
there are several indications in the literature that this system
is old, e.g., Poppenhaeger et al. (2010) measured a low X-
ray luminosity of logLX = 26.48± 0.13, Rivera et al. (2005a)
measured a large rotation period of 96.7 days and a low jitter
of ∼ 3 m s−1, and Hosey et al. (2015) showed that it is very
quiet with variation amplitudes of only 17.2 mmag in the op-
tical. Its absolute magnitude is about 0.7 mag brighter than
the main sequence, which could be an indication of youth,
however this can be explained by its high-metallicity alone
(e.g., Neves et al. 2013 measure [Fe/H]≈ 0.12–40 dex). It is
therefore most likely that GJ 876 is an old interloper to the
β Pictoris moving group rather than a member, as its age is
not conciliable with that of the group (24± 3 Myr; Bell et al.
2015a) and a star must display both consistent kinematics and
a consistent age before it can be considered as a new moving
group member (Song et al. 2002; Malo et al. 2013).

Marcy et al. (1998) and Delfosse et al. (1998a) have identi-
ﬁed a 227 m s−1 RV signal corresponding to GJ 876 b, a Jovian
planet (Mp sini ≈ 2.1 MJup) on an eccentric (e = 0.27± 0.03)
60.85 ± 0.15-days orbit at 0.21 AU around GJ 876. Marcy
et al. (2001) subsequently discovered GJ 876 c, a Mp sini ≈

0.6 MJup planet in 2:1 resonance with GJ 876 b at 0.13 AU
and on a 30.1-days orbit around GJ 876. Rivera et al. (2005b)
then discovered GJ 876 d, a third, Mp sini ≈ 5.9 M⊕ planet on
a 1.9-days orbit around GJ 876.

Correia et al. (2010) predicted the possible existence of
a low-mass (< 2 M⊕) planet, in 4:1 orbital resonance with
GJ 876 b that could explain how the high-eccentricity (e =
0.14) of the orbit of GJ 876 d could have survived for more
than ≈ 1 Myr, however the existence of such a planet has not
been conﬁrmed yet. Finally, Rivera et al. (2010) conﬁrmed
the existence of a fourth planet, GJ 876 e, on a 126.6-days
orbit and a minimum mass of Mp sini = 12.9± 1.7 M⊕.
We followed GJ 876 as part of the nearby sample over
17 nights spanning > 700 days with a typical S/N≈ 170 per
night, and recovered it as an RV variable target with V =
196± 19 m s−1, which is consistent within 1.6σ with the RV
amplitude measured by Marcy et al. (1998). Furthermore, we
ﬁnd Vmax
measurements in the literature.

(cid:0)Nς = 3(cid:1) = 234 m s−1, which is also consistent with

We used the Systemic 2 software4 (Meschiari et al. 2009,
2012) to identify periodic signals in our RV curve that in-
cludes 17 epochs spanning ∼ 1.9 yr. We identiﬁed a strong
signal at P ≈ 61.5 days associated to a false alarm probability
of only 3.5· 10−4%. Fitting an orbital solution with the Sim-
plex algorithm yielded orbital parameters listed in Table 6 and
the orbital phase curve displayed in Figure 13. There is one
data point (phase∼ 313° or 2011 July 10) that is a signiﬁ-
cant outlier to this orbital ﬁt, however it was obtained in bad
weather conditions with a seeing above 3".

The period, planetary mass and eccentricity are remarkably
consistent with values associated to GJ 876 b in the literature
(e.g., Marcy et al. 1998), except for the argument of perias-
tron ω that is signiﬁcantly different. This eccentric solution
is in fact a combined effect of the RV inﬂuence of the two
planets GJ 876 b and GJ 876 c on the host star, rather than a
physical orbit. It is therefore expected that this artiﬁcial value
for ω librates with time. Furthermore, this also means that
our orbital parameters can only be meaningfully compared to
those of Marcy et al. (1998) who also ﬁtted a single orbit to
GJ 876 bc. To our knowledge, our data thus provide the ﬁrst
multi-wavelength conﬁrmation of the planets GJ 876 bc, thus
conﬁrming that the RV signal cannot be likely explained by

4 http://github.com/stefano-meschiari/Systemic2

Once the periodic signal of GJ 876 bc is subtracted from
our data, our long-term precision does not allow us to detect
any additional signal that could be associated with the other
known planets orbiting GJ 876 (see Figure 13). Our analysis
however demonstrates that we are able to detect planets with
the characteristics of GJ 876 bc using a 3 m-class telescope
and relatively inexpensive equipment.

HD 160934 AB (HIP 86346) is a young and active M0-
type low-mass star member of the AB Doradus moving group
(Zuckerman et al. 2004; Malo et al. 2013), located at 33.1±
2.2 pc (van Leeuwen 2007). It has been conﬁrmed as a close
(0.(cid:48)(cid:48)12) SB1 binary in an eccentric (e ≈ 0.8), 17.1–year orbit
both by the RV (Gálvez et al. 2006) and direct-imaging (Hor-
muth et al. 2007) methods. Its individual components have
estimated spectral types of M0 and M2–M3 (Gálvez et al.
2006) and estimated masses of 0.69 M(cid:12) and 0.57 M(cid:12) (Hor-
muth et al. 2007).

Grifﬁn (2013) used their RV measurements as well as those
reported by López-Santiago et al. (2010), Maldonado et al.
(2010) and Gizis et al. (2002) to derive an orbital solution
for HD 160934 AB. They assumed an orbital inclination of
82.3 ± 0.8 °, which was obtained from direct imaging data
(Hormuth et al. 2007; Lafrenière et al. 2007; Evans et al.
2012) and stellar masses of 0.65 and 0.5 M(cid:12), respectively.

We followed HD 160934 AB as part of the young sam-
ple for a total of 5 nights spanning 338 days with a typi-
cal S/N of 150 per night and recovered it as an RV variable
with V = 581 ± 92 m s−1. We ﬁnd a strong linear trend of
1853± 163 m s−1 yr−1 in its RV curve, however the reduced
χ2
r value remains high (11.3) even after subtracting a linear
curve.

In Figure 14, we compare our RV measurements to those
reported by Grifﬁn (2013) and we ﬁnd that they are consistent
with the orbital solution that they propose, however our lim-
ited time baseline only allows us to detect a linear trend in our
RV data.

LO Peg (HIP 106231) is yet another young, active K8 low-
mass star member of the AB Doradus moving group (Zucker-
man et al. 2004; Malo et al. 2013), located at 24.80± 0.65 pc
(van Leeuwen 2007). Measurements of polarization suggest
the possibility that a circumstellar envelope remains around
LO Peg or that signiﬁcant brightness inhomogeneities ex-
ist on its surface (Pandey et al. 2009). This target has the
largest rotational velocity of our sample with vsini = 70 ±
10 km s−1 (Głe¸bocki & Gnaci´nski 2005) and a rotation period
of 0.42 days (Messina et al. 2010).
We followed LO Peg as part of the young sample for a to-
tal of 10 nights spanning 314 days with a typical S/N∼ 100
and identiﬁed it as an RV variable with V = 758± 120 m s−1.
The RV variability is not well ﬁt by a linear trend and it is
thus very unlikely that it can be explained by a massive stellar
companion. However, it is possible that the loss of RV infor-
mation due to rotational broadening of the stellar lines is the

only cause of this large RV variation (see Figure 11(b)). Ad-
ditional RV follow-up using a larger spectral grasp might be
able to mitigate this effect.

8.2. Candidate RV Variable Targets

BD+20 1790 is a fast-rotating (vsini = 16±3 km s−1; White
et al. 2007), active K5-type (Reid et al. 2004) member of the
AB Doradus moving group (López-Santiago et al. 2006; Malo
et al. 2013), located at 38.8± 2.0 pc (Shkolnik et al. 2012).
Hernán-Obispo et al. (2010) identiﬁed RV variability at an
amplitude of ≈ 1.8 km s−1 in the optical. Based on its photo-
metric variability as well as analyses of its bi-sector and spec-
troscopic indices of chromospheric activity, they interpret the
RV signal as the probable signature of a close-in (0.07 AU),
massive (6–7 MJup) planet on a 7.8–days orbit rather than the
effect of chromospheric activity. They note that two solutions
of different eccentricities could ﬁt the RV data (e = 0.05±0.02

or e = 0.14± 0.04).

Figueira et al. (2010) subsequently presented evidence
against the interpretation of a planetary companion, by show-
ing that the RV signal correlates with the bi-sector span of
the stellar lines, and by obtaining a different RV variation am-
plitude of 460 m s−1 with a periodicity of 2.8 days that corre-
spond to the rotation period of the star.

Hernán-Obispo et al. (2015) presented a re-analysis of the
RV variations of BD+20 1790 by removing the RV signal
due to jitter using a Bayesian method and suggested that the
RV variation is due both to stellar activity and a planetary
companion. They furthermore suggest that the bisector span–
RV correlation reported by Figueira et al. (2010) was due to
ﬂare events and that the correlation disappears in ﬂare-free
data. They present new orbital parameters for the candidate
BD+20 1790 b that are similar to those reported by Hernán-
Obispo et al. (2010), except that they ﬁnd a more eccentric

planet BD+20 1790 b (see Solution 1 with e = 0.05 in Hernán-Obispo et al. 2010). We ﬁnd an RV scatter that is consistent with
that of Hernán-Obispo et al. (2010), suggesting that there might be an RV signal not associated with stellar activity since the
amplitude does not depend on wavelength, however our data does not match the orbital solution suggested by Hernán-Obispo
et al. (2010), or any of those reported in the literature for the candidate BD+20 1790 b.

solution (e ≈ 0.1 to e ≈ 0.2).
We observed BD+20 1790 as part of the young sample for a
total of 8 nights spanning ≈ 3.5 years with a typical S/N≈ 70
per night, and recovered it as a candidate RV variable, with
V = 321 ± 71 m s−1. Our RV curve is consistent with varia-
tions at an amplitude of ≈ 1 km s−1 (see Figure 3(g)), thus pro-
viding further indication that the RV variability might not be
explained by chromospheric activity alone. However, our data
are inconsistent with any of the orbital solutions presented by
Hernán-Obispo et al. (2010) and Hernán-Obispo et al. (2015)
(e.g., see Figure 15).

identify any statistically signiﬁcant periodicity. More follow-
up observations will thus be needed to assess whether the RV
variations could be caused by a companion or not. It is un-
likely that the RV variability of BD+20 1790 could be ex-
plained by the loss of RV due to its fast rotation or to stellar
jitter (see Figure 11(a)).

Using any combination of our data set or those of Hernán-
Obispo et al. (2010) and Figueira et al. (2010) , we cannot

EQ Peg A (GJ 896 A; HIP 116132) is a young, M3.5-type
(Newton et al. 2014; Davison et al. 2015) ﬂaring low-mass
star located at 6.58± 0.16 pc (van Leeuwen 2007). Zucker-
man et al. (2013) suggested that it is a member of the Octans-
Near association.
EQ Peg A has a stellar companion (EQ Peg B) at an angular
distance of ≈ 5.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 (≈ 36 AU), which is an M4.0-type ﬂare star

24

(Davison et al. 2015).
We followed EQ Peg A as part of the young sample for a to-
tal of 6 nights spanning ≈ 3.3 years with a typical S/N≈ 170
per night, and recovered it as a candidate RV variable with V =
175± 37 m s−1. This RV variability cannot be explained by a
long-term linear trend that could be produced by EQ Peg B.
The loss of RV information due to rotational broadening is not
important enough to explain this large RV variability, however
the addition of a jitter term at the larger end of the distribution
measured by Bailey et al. (2012) could be sufﬁcient (see Fig-
ure 11(a)). Additional follow-up will be required to address
this.
GJ 3942 (HIP 79126) is a nearby M0 star (Vyssotsky 1956)
located at 16.93± 0.30 pc (van Leeuwen 2007). No precise
RV measurements were reported in the literature as of yet.
We followed GJ 3942 as part of the nearby sample for a
total of 7 nights spanning 92 days, at a typical S/N≈ 150 per
night. We identiﬁed it as a candidate RV variable with V =
78± 20 m s−1. A high-S/N follow-up over a longer baseline
will be useful to determine whether this RV signal is physical
or not.
GJ 537 B (HIP 68588 B) is a nearby M0 star (Gaidos et al.
2014) located at 12.3± 0.9 pc (Jenkins 1952). It is a compan-
ion to GJ 537 A at an angular separation of ≈ 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)9.

We followed GJ 537 B as part of the nearby sample for a
total of 8 nights spanning a total of 326 days with a typical
S/N≈ 180 per night. We recovered it as a candidate RV vari-
able with V = 71± 19 m s−1. Additional follow-up measure-
ments will be needed to determine the nature of this likely RV
variability.
GJ 725 A (HIP 91768) is a nearby (3.57 ± 0.03 pc; van
Leeuwen 2007), quiet and slowly-rotating M3-type star (Jenk-
ins et al. 2009).
Nidever et al. (2002) have shown that GJ 725 A is stable
within 100 m s−1 on a baseline of ≈ 3 years and Endl et al.
(2006) further constrained its RV stability by obtaining a scat-
ter of only 7.4 m s−1 in their RV measurements over a baseline
of ≈ 7 years.

GJ 725 A has a co-moving M3.5-type (Jenkins et al. 2009)
companion (GJ 725 B; HIP 91772) at an angular separation
of ≈ 13.(cid:48)(cid:48)3. Endl et al. (2006) report that they detect a linear
RV slope of 6.99± 0.86 m s−1 yr−1 in the GJ 725 A data over
a 7.09 year baseline, which they interpret as a small portion of
its orbit around the center of mass of GJ 725 AB.
We followed GJ 725 A as part of the nearby sample for a to-
tal of 5 nights that spanned 2.8 years with a typical S/N≈ 170
per night and identiﬁed it as a candidate RV variable with
V = 56 ± 15 m s−1. Our data is be well ﬁt by a linear trend
with a slope of 35± 5 m s−1 yr−1,
Using the projected separation of GJ 725 AB (≈ 47 AU)
and assuming typical masses of ≈ 0.36 M(cid:12) and ≈ 0.3 M(cid:12) that
correspond to their respective spectral types of M3 and M3.5
(Reid & Hawley 2005; Kaltenegger & Traub 2009), their or-
bital period should be P ≈ 400 years. This corresponds to a

tangential velocity of v ≈ 1.75 km s−1 as measured from the
center of mass in the case of a circular orbit.
In the ex-
treme case where the orbit is seen edge on from the Earth,
we could expect a change of RV of up to ≈ 25 m s−1 yr−1 per
year. Our RV slope measurement is slightly larger than this,
which could be an indication that the orbit of GJ 725 AB is
eccentric (e.g., e (cid:38) 0.155 would be sufﬁcient).

We thus measure an RV slope that is consistent with the
orbit of GJ 725 AB as long as it is slightly eccentric, however
in the ≈ 9 years that separate our measurements from those
of Endl et al. (2006), it might seem surprising that the RV
slope has changed by ≈ 28 m s−1 yr−1. Assuming that both
our measurements are consistent with the orbit of GJ 725 AB
indeed puts a much stronger constraint on its eccentricity, at
e (cid:38) 0.435.
GJ 740 (HIP 93101) is a nearby, weakly active M0.5 star
(Reiners et al. 2012) located at 10.91± 0.18 pc (van Leeuwen
2007). No precise RV measurements were reported in the lit-
erature as of yet.
We followed GJ 740 as part of the nearby sample for a to-
tal of 11 nights spanning 123 days with a typical S/N≈ 190
per night. We recovered it as a candidate RV variable with
V = 65± 16 m s−1. A high-S/N follow-up over a longer base-
line will be useful to determine whether this RV signal is
physical or not. We note a signiﬁcant linear trend in our
RV curve with a slope of −415± 44 m s−1 yr−1, however we
r value of ≈ 10.2 from a linear ﬁt,
obtain a high reduced χ2
which indicates that the scatter is still relatively high even
when the linear trend is subtracted. We obtain ς = 46.3 m s−1
and V = 43.4 ± 16.3 m s−1 (Nς = 2.7) after the subtraction,
which would not qualify for an additional statistically signiﬁ-
cant variation under our criteria.
GJ 9520 (HIP 75187) is a nearby M1.5-type (Reid et al.
2004) star located at 11.41±0.24 pc (van Leeuwen 2007). No
precise RV measurements were reported in the literature for
this star as of yet.
We followed GJ 9520 as part of the nearby sample for a
total of 7 nights spanning 314 days with a typical S/N≈ 170
per night. We recovered it as a candidate RV variable with
V = 77 ± 19 m s−1. Additional follow-up will be needed to
determine whether this RV signal is physical or not.
LHS 371 (HIP 70529) and LHS 372 (HIP 70536) form a
binary stellar system located at 16.36±0.40 pc (van Leeuwen
2007) with respective spectral types of M0 and M1 (Gaidos
et al. 2014), and are separated by ≈ 45". No precise RV mea-
surements for any of the two components were reported in the
literature as of yet.

We followed both LHS 371 and LHS 372 as part of the
nearby sample for a total of 5 and 4 nights that span 38 and
49 days with typical S/N precisions of ≈ 180 and 135 per
night, respectively. Both components were identiﬁed as can-
didate RV variables, with V = 48± 15 m s−1 (LHS 371) and
V = 58± 18 m s−1 (LHS 372). Subsequent follow-up will be
needed to determine whether this RV variation is physical.

LHS 374 (HIP 70956) is a slow rotating and chromospher-
ically inactive, nearby M0 star (Gaidos et al. 2014) located
at 16.99± 0.42 pc (van Leeuwen 2007). No precise RV mea-
surements were reported in the literature for this star as of yet.
We followed LHS 374 as part of the nearby sample for a
total of 5 nights spanning 43 days with a typical S/N≈ 180
and recovered it as a candidate RV variable with V = 76 ±
15 m s−1. Subsequent follow-up will be needed to determine
whether this RV variation is physical.

8.3. Likely Linear Trends in RV Curves

The presence of a massive companion at a large enough
separation can induce a linear variation in our RV curves with
a period that possibly exceeds our temporal baseline cover-
age of a given target. The criteria deﬁned above, which are
based on the scatter of RV points around the mean, will be
less sensitive to detecting such variations in a given RV curve,
compared with one where at least one period is sufﬁciently
sampled. In order to identify such candidate RV variables, we
have ﬁt a linear slope to all RV curves presented in this work
using the IDL routine mpﬁtfun.pro written by Craig B. Mark-
wardt5. In this section, we focus on the targets for which a
linear ﬁt yielded a reduced chi-square of at most 3, corre-
sponding to an non-null RV slope at a statistical signiﬁcance
of at least 3σ. These criteria have yielded 3 likely RV variable
targets :
GJ 458 A is a nearby M0 star (Reid et al. 2004) located
at 15.52 ± 0.34 pc (van Leeuwen 2007). It has an M3-type
companion (GJ 458 B, or BD+55 1519 B; Hawley et al. 1997)
at an angular distance of ≈ 14.(cid:48)(cid:48)7.
We followed GJ 458 A as part of the nearby sample for a
total of 7 nights spanning 100 days with a typical S/N≈ 180
per night. We did not recover it as a statistically signiﬁcant RV
variable in terms of RV scatter on our total baseline, however
its RV curve is well ﬁt by a linear trend (χ2
r = 3.0) with a cor-
responding slope of −185± 50 m s−1 yr−1 (3.7σ signiﬁcance;
see Figure 4(f)).
Assuming a mass of ≈ 0.58 M(cid:12) for GJ 458 A (Gaidos
et al. 2014) and a mass of ≈ 0.36 M(cid:12) for GJ 458 B that is
typical of a ﬁeld M3 star (Reid & Hawley 2005; Kalteneg-
ger & Traub 2009) and using the projected separation of
≈ 228 AU, we would expect a period of ≈ 3550 years for the
orbit of the GJ 458 AB system in a case with zero eccentric-
ity. This would be consistent with a maximal RV slope of
only ≈ 1.2m s−1 yr−1. Only an well-aligned extremely eccen-
tric orbit (e (cid:38) 0.95) could explain this, which is highly un-
likely. It is thus probable that we are not measuring the effect
of GJ 458 B, but rather possibly that of an unknown, massive
companion. It is unlikely that this RV signal is due to stellar
jitter, as this would yield a more rapidly varying random RV
signal, and GJ 458 A is an inactive, slow-rotating star (Her-
rero et al. 2012).

GJ 3305 AB is a known 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)093 binary low-mass M0-type
(Kasper et al. 2007) member of the β Pictoris moving group
located at 29.8± 0.8 pc. It has been identiﬁed as a 66" com-
mon proper motion companion system to the F0-type star
51 Eridani (Feigelson et al. 2006), which itself has a 2 MJup
planetary, T-type companion identiﬁed by the method of di-
rect imaging (Macintosh et al. 2015). This system will thus
be a very important benchmark to understand stellar and plan-
etary properties at young ages in the near future.

Montet et al. (2015) recently led a full RV and astrometric
characterization of the GJ 3305 AB pair and their orbital prop-
erties. They found a period of 29.16± 0.65 yr, a semi-major
axis of 9.8± 0.15 AU, an eccentricity of 0.19± 0.02 and indi-
vidual masses of 0.65±0.05 and 0.44±0.05 M(cid:12) for A and B,
respectively. They compared the observed dynamical masses
with evolutionary models to derive an age of 28+15
−6 Myr for
the system, consistent with the age of the β Pictoris moving
group (24±3 Myr; Bell et al. 2015a). They, however, obtain a
dynamical mass for GJ 3305 B that is discrepant with that of
evolutionary models, which they suggest could be explained
by the presence of an unresolved companion.

Delorme et al. (2012) have identiﬁed a potential 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)38 com-
panion to GJ 3305 A by direct imaging in a 2009 NACO
image in the L(cid:48) band, however further observations obtained
in 2012 revealed that it was not a planetary companion, but
rather a speckle or a background star .
We observed the unresolved GJ 3305 AB pair during a to-
tal of 4 nights at a typical S/N≈ 80 per night over a period
of 5 months as part of the young sample. The RV curve of
this target is well ﬁt by a linear trend (χ2
r = 1.8) with a cor-
responding slope of 435± 145 m s−1 yr−1 (3.0σ signiﬁcance;
Figure 3(d)).

In Figure 16, we compare our measurements with those re-
ported by Montet et al. (2015) and ﬁnd that our observed lin-
ear trend is inconsistent with the orbital solution that they sug-
gest. To make this more apparent in the ﬁgure, we performed
a 250-steps Monte Carlo ﬁtting of a linear polynomial rela-
tion to our four data points, accounting for their error bars,
and displayed the resulting best ﬁts on top of the RV resid-
uals.
It can be seen that they are signiﬁcantly inconsistent
with a zero-slope relation that would be expected in RV resid-
uals randomly distributed around the orbital solution. Since
our RV measurements are relative, we have applied an arbi-
trary shift to align our RV data with the known orbit. As a
result, the only information contained in our data is this short-
timescale slope that is inconsistent with the known orbit. We
note that several other RV measurements from the literature
also display signiﬁcant short-timescale variations that are un-
explained by the binary orbit, which could be indicative of an
additional RV signal. More follow-up data will be needed to
conﬁrm whether there is an additional RV variability to this
system that is statistically signiﬁcant.

8.4. Other Noteworthy Targets

26

We describe in this section the targets that we did not select
as candidate RV variables, but for which relevant information
is available in the literature.

√

GJ 15 A: Howard et al. (2014) reported the detection of a
5.35 M⊕ planet in a 11.443-day orbit around GJ 15 A. Our
data lack the precision and cadence necessary to detect the
planet outright. However, by assuming the planet period and
ephemeris reported by Howard et al. (2014), we can place a
constraint on the mass of the planet with the data presented
here. We used our 10 per-night RV measurements with un-
certainties of < 60 m s−1, and phased them an 11.443-day pe-
riod and ephemeris reported by Howard et al. (2014). We
averaged measurements between phases of 0–π rad, and sub-
sequently between π–2π rad. We then subtracted the results
obtained from these two averages and converted this number
into a semi-amplitude by making use of the fact that a simi-
lar operation carried out on a sinusoidal wave (i.e., subtract-
ing its average between phases of 0–0.5 rad and that between
3K, where K is its semi-amplitude.
0.5–1 rad) is equal to
We used the approximation that our RV measurements are
evenly distributed in phase to derive K = 8 m s−1. In order to
quantify the uncertainty on this measurement, we computed
a Monte Carlo simulation of 20 trial periods. For each trial
period, we carried out the same phase-averaged measurement
of the semi-amplitude, and measured a standard deviation of
12 m s−1. We thus derive a value of K = 8± 12 m s−1 for the
RV variation semi-amplitude of GJ 15 A, which corresponds
to a 3σ upper limit of < 36 m s−1 on its RV variation, or an
upper limit of < 66 M⊕ on the mass of its companion.
ε Eridani is a young K2 star located at 3.216 ± 0.002 pc
(van Leeuwen 2007), for which disputed planet candidates
have been reported by Campbell et al. (1988) and Quillen
& Thorndike (2002), associated with RV scatters lower than
15 m s−1.
We followed this target as part of the young survey for a to-
tal of 13 nights spanning 339 days, with a typical S/N≈ 300
per night. We did not identify it as an RV variable (V =
26± 15 m s−1), however we lack the long-term precision that
would be needed to determine whether the signal reported by
Campbell et al. (1988) or Quillen & Thorndike (2002) are spu-
rious.

9. CONCLUSION

In this paper we report the results of a precise NIR RV
survey of 32 low-mass stars with spectral types K2–M4, car-
ried out with CSHELL and an isotopologue gas cell at the
NASA IRTF, 19 of which were never followed by high pre-
cision RV surveys. We used a novel data reduction and RV
extraction pipeline to demonstrate that we can achieve short-
term photon-limited RV precisions of ≈ 8 m s−1 with long-
term stability of ≈ 15 m s−1, which are unprecedented using
a small telescope that is easily accessible to the community.

We used the non-detections of our survey to assign up-
per limits on the masses of close-in companions to our tar-

gets, and we provide the ﬁrst multi-wavelength conﬁrmation
of GJ 876 bc and recover orbital parameters that are fully con-
sistent with those reported in the literature. We obtained RV
curves for two binary systems (HD 160934 AB, GJ 725 AB)
that are consistent with the literature, and report that GJ 740
and GJ 458 A could be bound to unknown, long-period and
massive companions. We identiﬁed 7 new candidate RV vari-
ables (EQ Peg A, GJ 3942, GJ 537 B, GJ 9520, LHS 371,
LHS 372, and LHS 374) with statistical signiﬁcances in the
3–5σ range. Additional observations will be needed to verify
whether these RV variable stars host substellar or planetary
companions.

Comparing our results with the projected rotational veloc-
ities of our sample, we showed that the proposed jitter rela-
tion of Bailey et al. (2012) for young TW Hydrae members
is not large enough to account for the observed RV variations
of LHS 374, BD+20 1790 and V577 Per. The probability that
targets in the nearby sample display larger RV variations than
those in the young sample is of 54%; the two samples are thus
not signiﬁcantly different in this regard. We ﬁnd that very ac-
tive stars in our survey can display RV variabilities down to
∼ 25–50 m s−1, providing a constraint on the effect of jitter in
the NIR.

In the near future, iSHELL will be mounted on the IRTF
with a methane gas cell similar to that used in this work;
the improved spectral grasp (≈ 50 times larger), resolution
(R ≈ 70000) and instrumental sensitivity will achieve RV pre-
cisions of (cid:46) 5 m s−1 that will allow the detection of super-
Earth planets ((cid:38) 13 M⊕) near the habitable zone of mid-M
low-mass stars in the solar neighborhood. Achieving such
precisions on active, very low-mass stars using optical facili-
ties will be challenging, hence NIR RV techniques will play
a key role in characterizing Earth-like planets in the habitable
zone of low-mass stars. These will serve as a crucial com-
plement to transiting exoplanet studies, as the combination of
both the RV and transit methods will provide a measurement
of the mean planet density and put strong constraints on the
physical properties of future Earth-like discoveries.
