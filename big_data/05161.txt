Abstract

We prove a formula relating the Hausdorﬀ dimension of a deterministic Borel subset of R and the
Hausdorﬀ dimension of its image under a conformal map from the upper half plane to a complementary
connected component of an SLEκ curve for κ (cid:54)= 4. Our proof is based on the relationship between SLE
and Liouville quantum gravity together with the one-dimensional KPZ formula of Rhodes-Vargas (2011)
and the KPZ formula of Gwynne-Holden-Miller (2015). As an intermediate step we obtain a KPZ formula
which relates the Euclidean dimension of a subset of an SLEκ curve for κ ∈ (0, 4) to the dimension of
the same set with respect to the γ-quantum length measure on the curve induced by an independent
Gaussian free ﬁeld, γ =

The Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLEκ) is a family of conformally invariant random fractal curves in two
dimensions, originally introduced in [Sch00]. SLE curves arise as the scaling limit of a variety of models in
statistical physics; see, e.g., [LSW04, Smi10, SS05, SS09, Mil10].
There are various ways to quantify the precise manner in which the SLEκ curve is fractal. Suppose, for
concreteness, that η is a chordal SLEκ from 0 to ∞ in H with hulls (Kt) and for t > 0 let ft : H\ Kt → H be
its time t centered Loewner map (i.e. ft(η(t)) = 0, ft(∞) = ∞, and limz→∞ ft(z)/z = 1). The most basic
measure of the fractality of η is its Hausdorﬀ dimension, which was shown to be (1 + κ/8)∧ 2 in [Bef08]. One
can also consider the H¨older regularity of either η itself or the maps f
. The optimal H¨older exponent for
the SLE curve is computed in [JVL11] (see also [RS05, Lin08] for intermediate results). The optimal H¨older
exponent for f
Another way to measure the fractality of η is the multifractal spectrum. This is the function which gives,
)(cid:48)(x + iy)| =
for each s ∈ [−1, 1], the Hausdorﬀ dimension of the set of points in x ∈ R such that |(f
y−s+oy(1) as y → 0. The multifractal spectrum was predicted non-rigorously by Duplantier in [Dup00]
(see also [Dup99a, Dup99b] for earlier predictions in special cases) and computed rigorously in [GMS14].
There are a number of other quantities related to the multifractal spectrum which have been computed
either rigorously or non-rigorously. These include the winding spectrum (predicted in [DB02,DB08]), higher
multifractal spectra depending on the derivative behavior on both sides of the curve (predicted in [Dup03]),
the integral means spectrum (rigorous computations of diﬀerent versions given in [BS09a, GMS14, DNNZ12,
LY13, LY14]), the multifractal spectrum at the tip (computed in [JVL12]), and the boundary multifractal
spectrum (computed in [ABJ15]).
In this paper, we will consider a diﬀerent measure of the fractality of η, namely the manner in which
the Hausdorﬀ dimension of a subset Y ⊂ R transforms under the inverse centered Loewner map f

independently of η. We also prove a variant (Theorem 1.3) for a conformal map from H to a complementary
connected component of a whole SLEκ curve, κ ∈ (0, 4) ∪ (4, 8). Our formula appears to be closely related
to the multifractal spectrum of SLE; see Problem 1 in Section 3.
Although our main results are statements about the conformal geometry of SLE, our proofs are based on
the relationship between SLE and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG). For γ ∈ (0, 2) and a domain D ⊂ C,

where h is some variant of the Gaussian free ﬁeld [She07, SS13] (GFF) on D and dx2 + dy2 is the Euclidean
metric. The formula (1.1) does not make rigorous sense since h is only a distribution (in the sense of
Schwartz), not a pointwise-deﬁned function. However, it is shown in [DS11] that one can make rigorous
sense of the volume form associated with LQG. In particular, there exists a measure µh on D which is the
a.s. limit of regularized versions of eγh(z) dz, where dz is the Euclidean volume form. The measure µh is
called the γ-quantum area measure induced by h. There is also a γ-quantum length measure νh deﬁned on
certain curves in D which is the a.s. limit of regularized versions of e(γ/2)h(z) |dz|, where |dz| is the Euclidean
length element. It is shown in [She16] that νh can be deﬁned on SLEκ-type curves provided κ ∈ (0, 4) and

The KPZ formula [KPZ88] relates the Euclidean and quantum dimensions of a set X ⊂ D independent
from h. There are various rigorous versions of this formula using diﬀerent notions of dimension; see [Aru13,
BGRV14,BJRV13,BS09b,DMS14,DRSV14b,DS11,RV11,GHM15]. Our main result will be proven by means
of two versions of the KPZ formula, which will be used to express dimH f
(Y ) and dimH Y , respectively, in
terms of the same quantum dimension. The ﬁrst version of the KPZ formula (stated as Theorem 2.1 below)
relates the Euclidean dimension of a subset of an SLE curve to the dimension of the same set with respect
κ. This formula will

be deduced from another KPZ formula, that of [GHM15]. The other KPZ formula we will use directly is the
boundary measure KPZ formula appearing in [RV11].

and the Hausdorﬀ dimension of the subset of an SLE curve obtained by “zipping up” the set Y into the
curve by means of a conformal map.
Theorem 1.1. Let κ > 0, κ (cid:54)= 4, and let η be a chordal SLEκ from 0 to ∞ in H, parameterized by half-plane
capacity (resp. a radial SLEκ from 1 to 0 in D, parameterized by minus log conformal radius, or a whole-plane
SLEκ from 0 to ∞ parameterized by capacity). Let t > 0 and let ft be the time t centered Loewner map for

We also have a variant of Theorem 1.1 when we consider a complementary connected component of a whole
SLE curve, rather than a curve stopped at a ﬁxed time. We state the theorem for chordal SLEκ(ρL; ρR) and
whole-plane SLEκ(ρ) processes, which are constructed for ρL, ρR > −2 and ρ > −2 in [MS16a, Section 2.2]
and [MS13, Section 2.1], respectively (see also Section 1.3). See Figure 1 for an illustration.
Theorem 1.3. Let κ ∈ (0, 4) ∪ (4, 8), and suppose that we are in one of the following situations.

• D ⊂ C is a simply connected domain which is not all of C, ρL, ρR > −2, and η is a chordal SLEκ(ρL; ρR)
in D with some choice of starting point and target point and force points immediately to the left and
right of the starting point.

• D = C, ρ > −2, and η is a whole-plane SLEκ(ρ) between two points in C ∪ {∞}.

Let U be the set of connected components of D \ η. For U ∈ U, let xU (resp. yU ) be the point visited by η at
the time at which it starts (resp. ﬁnishes) tracing ∂U . Deﬁne the following subsets of U.

• U + (resp. U−) is the set of U ∈ U for which xU (cid:54)= yU and the counterclockwise (resp. clockwise) arc

of ∂U from xU to yU is traced by η.

• U 0 is the set of U ∈ U for which xU = yU .

For U ∈ U− ∪ U +, let gU : H → U be a conformal map which takes 0 to xU and ∞ to yU (chosen in some
manner which depends on η), and if U ∈ U 0 let gU : H → U be a conformal map which takes ∞ to xU = yU .
Let Y ⊂ [0,∞) be a deterministic Borel set. Then a.s.

dimH gU (aY ) = Φκ (dimH Y ) ,
dimH gU (−aY ) = Φκ (dimH Y ) ,
dimH gU (aY + b) = Φκ (dimH Y ) ,

for each U ∈ U + and Lebesgue a.e. a > 0,
for each U ∈ U− and Lebesgue a.e. a > 0,
for each U ∈ U 0 and Lebesgue a.e. (a, b) ∈ R2,

(1.5)

where Φκ is as in (1.2).

Figure 1: An illustration of the statement of Theorem 1.3 in the case of a chordal SLEκ η and κ ∈ (4, 8).
The theorem relates the Hausdorﬀ dimension of the set Y ⊂ [0,∞) and the set gU (aY + b) for almost
all a, b > 0. The set U on the left ﬁgure is contained in U 0, and the map gU : H → U is deﬁned such
that gU (∞) = xU = yU . The complementary connected component of η shown in green (resp. orange) is
contained in U + (resp. U−). The blue (resp. red) dots represent the points xU (resp. yU ) for each of the
three considered domains.

In the setting of Theorem 1.3, topological considerations imply that for U ∈ U, either the counterclockwise
or clockwise arc of ∂U from xU to yU (or both) is traced by η, so U = U + ∪ U− ∪ U 0. For U ∈ U + (resp.
U ∈ U−), the function gU maps [0,∞) (resp. (−∞, 0]) to this counterclockwise (resp. clockwise) arc. The
set U 0 is empty if κ ∈ (0, 4) and for κ > 4 consists of “bubbles” surrounded by either the left or right side
of η if κ ∈ (4, 8).
For U ∈ U +, the set of conformal maps H → U which take 0 to xU and ∞ to yU is the same as the set of
maps of the form z (cid:55)→ gU (az) for a > 0. Hence a.s. dimH g(Y ) = Φκ (dimH Y ) for “Lebesgue a.e.” conformal

problem to determine whether this relation in fact holds a.s. for every such conformal map simultaneously
(see Problem 2 in Section 3). We note, however, that (1.5) (and the analogous relation in Theorem 1.1) does
not hold a.s. for all choices of Y simultaneously. Indeed, taking Y to be one of the multifractal spectrum

sets (cid:101)Θs ⊂ R for s ∈ [−1, 1] studied in [GMS14] gives a counterexample.

Remark 1.4. Theorem 1.1 can be used to give another derivation of the double point dimension of SLEκ
for κ ∈ (4, 8). Indeed, the double points of such an SLE correspond to intersection points with the bound-
ary which are subsequently mapped into the domain by the reverse Loewner ﬂow. The dimension of the
intersection of an SLEκ for κ ∈ (4, 8) with the domain boundary was shown to be 2 − 8/κ in [AS08] and
Φκ(2 − 8/κ) = 2 − (12 − κ)(4 + κ)/(8κ), which is the dimension of the double points of SLEκ [MW14].
The cut point dimension of SLEκ for κ ∈ (4, 8) can similarly be derived using Theorem 1.3. Indeed, it is
shown in [MS16a] that the conditional law of the left boundary of a chordal version of such an SLE given
its right boundary is that of an SLE16/κ(16/κ − 4;−8/κ) process. The dimension of the intersection of an
SLE16/κ(16/κ − 4;−8/κ) with [0,∞) was shown in [MW14] to be 5 − 8/κ + κ/2 and Φκ(5 − 8/κ + κ/2) =
3 − 3κ/8, which is the dimension of the cut points of an SLEκ derived in [MW14].

1.3 SLE/LQG background

In this subsection we brieﬂy review some facts about SLE and LQG which will be needed for the proofs of
our main results. We refer to the cited papers for more details. See also [GHM15, Sections 1.2 and 1.4] for
a more detailed overview.

We ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition of chordal and radial SLEκ(ρ) for κ > 0 and a ﬁnite vector of weights
ρ = (ρ1, . . . , ρn) and force points x1, . . . , xn in the closure of the domain. Such processes were ﬁrst introduced
in [LSW03, Section 8.3]. See also [SW05] and [MS16a, Section 2.2]. As deﬁned in [MS16a, Section 2.2], the
continuation threshold for an SLEκ(ρ) is the ﬁrst time that the sum of the weights of the force points which
have been disconnected from the target point by the curve is ≤ −2. This time was deﬁned in [MS16a,
Section 2.2], and is the largest time up to which SLEκ(ρ) is deﬁned as a continuous curve. Note that
the continuation threshold may be inﬁnite. We also recall the deﬁnition of whole-plane SLEκ(ρ) for ρ >
−2 [MS13, Section 2.1].
Now ﬁx γ ∈ (0, 2). A Liouville quantum gravity surface is an equivalence class of pairs (D, h) consisting of

a domain D ⊂ C and a distribution h on D, with two such pairs (D, h) and ((cid:101)D,(cid:101)h) declared to be equivalent
(i.e. diﬀerent parameterizations of the same surface) if there is a conformal map φ : (cid:101)D → D such that

form (1.6), in the sense that it is a.s. the case that for each Borel set A ⊂ (cid:101)D, we have µh(φ(A)) = µ(cid:101)h(A)

The quantum area and length measures µh and νh of [DS11] are preserved under transformations of the

and similarly for νh; see [DS11, Proposition 2.1]. Hence these measures are well-deﬁned on the LQG surface
(D, h). One can also deﬁne quantum surfaces with k ∈ N marked points in D ∪ ∂D by requiring that the
conformal map φ takes the marked points for one surface to those for the other.

Section 4.2] for a precise deﬁnition). The circle average embedding of an α-quantum cone is the particular
choice of distribution h deﬁned in [DMS14, Deﬁnition 9]. This is a convenient choice of embedding since with
this choice the law of the ﬁeld restricted to D is equal to that of a whole-plane GFF plus a log singularity, also
restricted to D. The circle average embedding is also the one used in [GHM15, Theorem 1.1]. Similarly, an
α-quantum wedge is an inﬁnite-volume quantum surface parameterized by H, which describes the behavior
explained in [DMS14, Section 4.4], one can also deﬁne an α-quantum wedge for α ∈ (Q, Q+γ/2). In this case,
the wedge is not parameterized by H and instead consists of an inﬁnite ordered sequence of ﬁnite-volume
“beads”, each of which has the topology of the disk and has ﬁnite quantum area and boundary length.

Quantum disks are ﬁnite-volume quantum surfaces parameterized by the unit disk D (or equivalently
any simply connected domain in C), which are most often taken to have one or two marked boundary
points (which are sampled uniformly from the quantum boundary measure). One can consider quantum
disks with speciﬁed area, boundary length, or both. Quantum spheres are ﬁnite-volume quantum surfaces
parameterized by the Riemann sphere, often taken to have ﬁxed area and sometimes taken to have one, two,
or three marked points. See [DMS14, Section 5].
In this paper our main interest in the above quantum surfaces stems from their relationship with SLEκ.
If one cuts an α-quantum cone by an independent whole-plane SLEκ(ρ) curve for κ = γ2 ∈ (0, 4) and
appropriate ρ > −2 depending on α, then one obtains an α(cid:48)-quantum wedge for a certain value of α(cid:48)
depending on α [DMS14, Theorem 1.12]. Similarly, one can cut an α-quantum wedge by an independent
chordal SLEκ(ρL; ρR) curve (with force points immediately to the left side and the right side, respectively,
of the starting point of the curve) to get a pair of independent quantum wedges [DMS14, Theorem 1.9]
for certain ρL, ρR > −2. In the case when α ∈ (Q, Q + γ/2), one replaces the SLEκ(ρL; ρR) curve with a
concatenation of such curves, one in each bead.
2, 2) and one cuts an α-quantum cone by an independent SLEκ(ρ) curve for κ = 16/γ2 ∈
(4, 8) and appropriate ρ > −2, one gets three independent beaded quantum surfaces corresponding to the
complementary connected components of the curve whose boundaries are traced by the left side of the curve,
the right side of the curve, and both sides of the curve, respectively. One of these surfaces is an α(cid:48)-quantum
wedge for α(cid:48) > Q and the other two are L´evy trees of quantum disks [DMS14, Theorem 1.18]. A similar
statement holds for an α-quantum wedge cut by an independent SLEκ(ρL; ρR) for κ = 16/γ2 and appropriate
ρL, ρR > −2 [DMS14, Theorem 1.17].
For κ > 4 whole-plane space-ﬁlling SLEκ from ∞ to ∞ is a variant of SLEκ which ﬁlls all of C, introduced
in [MS13, Sections 4.3 and 1.2.3] (c.f. [DMS14, Footnote 9]). In the case when κ ≥ 8, so SLEκ is already space-
ﬁlling, whole-plane space-ﬁlling SLEκ is a two-sided version of chordal SLEκ. In the case when κ ∈ (4, 8),
whole-plane space-ﬁlling SLEκ is obtained by iteratively ﬁlling in each of the bubbles disconnected from ∞
by a two-sided variant of chordal SLEκ with a space-ﬁlling SLEκ loop (so in particular cannot by described
by the Loewner equation). It is immediate from the construction that the marginal law of the left (resp.
right) boundary of η(cid:48) stopped upon hitting a ﬁxed point z ∈ C is that of a whole-plane SLE16/κ(2 − 16/κ)
from z to ∞ (c.f. [MS13, Theorem 1.1]).
Suppose (C, h, 0,∞) is a γ-quantum cone, γ ∈ (0, 2), and η(cid:48) is an independent whole-plane space-ﬁlling
SLEκ, parameterized by quantum mass with respect to h (so that µh(η(cid:48)([s, t])) = t − s for s < t). For
t ∈ R, let Lt (resp. Rt) be the change in the quantum length of the left (resp. right) outer boundary
of η(cid:48)((−∞, t]) relative to time 0. Then Zt = (Lt, Rt) is a correlated two-dimensional Brownian motion
with correlation − cos(4π/κ) [DMS14, Theorem 1.13]. (The formula − cos(4π/κ) for the correlation of the
Brownian motion was only proved for κ ∈ (4, 8] in [DMS14]. That the same formula holds for κ > 8 was
established in [GHMS15].) Furthermore, Z a.s. determines (h, η(cid:48)) modulo rotation [DMS14, Theorem 1.14].
Many quantities associated with η(cid:48) can be described explicitly in terms of Z. For example, the curve η(cid:48)
hits the left (resp. right) outer boundary of η(cid:48)((−∞, 0]) precisely when L (resp. R) hits a running inﬁmum
relative to time 0. See [GHM15] for further examples. The above facts are collectively referred to as the
peanosphere description of (h, η(cid:48)).

2 Proofs

2.1 KPZ formula for quantum lengths along an SLE curve

In this subsection we will prove a KPZ formula for the quantum length measure along an SLEκ curve for
κ ∈ (0, 4), which is needed for our proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.3. We state the theorem at a high level of
generality: we allow for chordal, radial, and whole-plane SLEκ (possibly with force points); and quantum
lengths measured with respect to a free- or zero-boundary GFF, as well as with respect to the distributions
which parameterize the various quantum surfaces deﬁned in [DMS14, Sections 4 and 5] (which are variants
of the GFF). See Section 1.3 for a brief review of the objects involved in the theorem statement.
Theorem 2.1. Let κ ∈ (0, 4), let ρ be a ﬁnite vector of weights, and let η be a chordal or radial SLEκ(ρ)

D (with the additive constant ﬁxed in some arbitrary way) independent from η and let νh be the γ-quantum
length measure induced by h, γ =
κ. Suppose that η is parameterized by νh-length, so that νh(η([0, t])) = t
for each t > 0. Let X be a random subset of η \ ∂D which is independent from h. Then almost surely,

The same holds if we make one or both of the following changes (where Q = 2/γ + γ/2 is as in (1.6)).

• Replace η by a whole-plane SLEκ(ρ) for ρ > −2 and replace h by a whole-plane GFF.
• In the chordal or radial case, replace h by a zero-boundary GFF on D or the distribution on D which
parameterizes a quantum disk (with ﬁxed area, boundary length, or both), an α-quantum wedge for
α ≤ Q, or a single bead of an α-quantum wedge for α ∈ (Q, Q + γ/2). In the whole-plane case, replace
h by the distribution on C which parameterizes a quantum sphere or an α-quantum cone for α < Q.

Theorem 2.1 will be proven using the KPZ-type formula [GHM15, Theorem 1.1] together with [DMS14,
Theorem 1.13] and a version of Kaufman’s theorem for subordinators [HP74, Theorem 4.1]. We remark that
an analogue of Theorem 2.1 when η is a ﬂow line of h (in the sense of [MS16a,MS16b,MS16c,MS13]) instead
of an SLE curve independent from h is proven in [Aru13].

Remark 2.2. The right side of (2.1) is equal to 2Ψγ

We will ﬁrst prove Theorem 2.1 in the special case of whole-plane SLEκ(2 − κ) on an independent
γ-quantum cone. This case is particularly convenient because it exactly ﬁts into the framework of the
peanosphere construction (Section 1.3), which is also the setting of [GHM15, Theorem 1.1].
Lemma 2.3. Let κ ∈ (0, 4) and let η be a whole-plane SLEκ(2 − κ) from 0 to ∞. Let (C, h, 0,∞) be a
γ-quantum cone independent from η with the circle average embedding (i.e. h is the distribution deﬁned
in [DMS14, Deﬁnition 9]) and let νh be its γ-quantum length measure, γ =
κ. Suppose that η is parame-
terized by νh-length, so that νh(η([0, t])) = t for each t > 0. If X ⊂ η is a set which is independent from h,
then dimH X and dimH η−1(X) are a.s. related by the formula (2.1).
κ. Let η(cid:48) be a whole-plane space-ﬁlling SLE16/κ from ∞ to ∞, independent from h and
Proof. Let γ =
parameterized by quantum mass with respect to h in such a way that η(cid:48)(0) = 0. By [DMS14, Footnote
9], the right outer boundary of η(cid:48)((−∞, 0]) is the ﬂow line from 0 to ∞ of a certain whole-plane GFF, so
by [MS13, Theorem 1.1] it has the law of a whole-plane SLEκ(2 − κ) curve. Therefore we can couple η with
(η(cid:48), h) in such a way that η is a.s. equal to this right outer boundary. In this coupling η is determined by η(cid:48)
(viewed modulo parameterization) and hence is independent from h. We assume that η is parameterized by
γ-quantum length with respect to h.
For t ≥ 0, let Rt be the change in the right boundary length of η(cid:48) between time 0 and time t, as
in [DMS14, Theorem 1.13]. That theorem tells us that R has the law of a deterministic constant multiple of
a standard linear Brownian motion. For r ≥ 0, let

Sr := inf {t ≥ 0 : Rt = −r} .

Equivalently, Sr is the ﬁrst time that η(cid:48) covers up r units of quantum length along its right boundary, or,
a.s. for each ﬁxed r, the inﬁmum of the times for which η(r) is no longer on the left right boundary of η(cid:48). In
particular, since η is parameterized by quantum length we have η(cid:48)(Sr) = η(r).

The process S has the law of a stable subordinator of index 1/2 (see e.g., [Ber99, Section 2.2]). By [HP74,

Theorem 4.1], we a.s. have

Proof of Theorem 2.1. By the absolute continuity of any of the listed choices for the distribution h on
bounded domains bounded away from the domain boundary and the marked points, it suﬃces to prove the
statement of the theorem for any of the listed choices of h. For simplicity we restrict attention to the case
when h is either a whole-plane GFF (in the whole-plane case) or a zero-boundary GFF on the domain D of η
(in the chordal or radial case). By conformal invariance and the LQG coordinate change formula (see (1.6))
we only need to prove the statement for each chordal or radial SLEκ(ρ) process in a single choice of domain
D.
First consider the case where η is a radial SLEκ(2 − κ) from 1 to ∞ in C \ D, with force point located
and let τ the the smallest t ≥ 0 for which the centered Loewner map ft from the unbounded component of

at z ∈ ∂D \ {1}. Let (cid:101)η be a whole-plane SLEκ(2 − κ) from 0 to ∞ parameterized by capacity seen from ∞
C \(cid:101)η((−∞, t]) to C \ D maps the force point of (cid:101)η to z. Note that it follows from scale invariance and the
domain Markov property that τ < ∞ a.s. By the domain Markov property we can couple η with (cid:101)η in such
a way that η = fτ ((cid:101)η|[τ,∞)) a.s.
Let(cid:101)h be a whole-plane GFF independent from (cid:101)η and let h(cid:48) :=(cid:101)h ◦ f−1
property and conformal invariance of the GFF, the conditional law of h(cid:48) given(cid:101)η([−∞, τ ]) and(cid:101)h|(cid:101)η([−∞,τ ]) is
(X) is a subset of (cid:101)η which is independent from (cid:101)h. By
(X) in place of X,(cid:101)η in place
of η, and(cid:101)h in place of h. By the LQG coordinate change formula we can apply the map fτ to obtain (2.1)

that of a zero-boundary GFF h on C\ D plus a function which is harmonic on C\ D. If X ⊂ η is determined
−1
by η, viewed modulo parameterization, then f
t
Lemma 2.3 and local absolute continuity, the formula (2.1) holds a.s. with f
with h(cid:48) in place of h. Since νh and νh(cid:48) diﬀer by multiplication by a smooth function, we obtain (2.1) for X,
η, and h.
Now suppose that η is a chordal or radial SLEκ(ρ) in D started from 1, with arbitrary choice of target
point, weights, and force points located at positive distance from 1, stopped when it hits the continuation
threshold. By the Schramm-Wilson coordinate change formula [SW05, Theorem 3] we immediately reduce to
the case of radial SLEκ(ρ). Let h be a zero-boundary GFF on D independent from η. Fix some z ∈ ∂D\{1}.
Let V ⊂ D be a simply connected subdomain such that ∂V ∩ ∂D contains a neighborhood of 1 in ∂D and V
lies at positive distance from the target point and all of the force points of η and from z. Let τV be the exit
time of η from V . By the form of the Loewner driving function for general radial SLEκ(ρ), we ﬁnd that the
law of η|[0,τV ] is absolutely continuous with respect to the law of a radial SLEκ(2 − κ) in D, started from
1, targeted at a point at positive distance from V , with force point at z, stopped at the ﬁrst time it exits
V . Therefore, the statement of the theorem for η follows from the statement for radial SLEκ(2 − κ) (proven
just above) provided we require that X ⊂ η([0, τV ]).
Now consider the case where η is a chordal or radial SLEκ(ρ) in D starting from 1 with completely
arbitrary choices target point, weights, and force points (even force points precisely on either side of the
starting point), stopped when it hits the continuation threshold. Let (ft)t≥0 be the centered Loewner maps
k−1 and σ
for η. For  > 0, let τ 
k be
the minimum of −1 and the smallest t > σ
k−1 for which the driving function Wt lies at distance at least 
k be the minimum of −1 and the smallest
from the image of each of the force points of η under ft and let σ
t > τ 
k for which Wt lies within distance /2 of at least one of the images of the force points of η under ft.
Note that each τ 
k is a stopping time for η. By the domain Markov property of SLEκ(ρ), the LQG
coordinate change formula, and the preceding paragraph, we ﬁnd that the statement of the corollary holds
for η provided we require that X ⊂ η([τ 
k]) for some k ∈ N. Taking a limit as  → 0 and using countable
stability of Hausdorﬀ dimension yields the statement of the theorem in the case of general chordal or radial
SLEκ(ρ).

Finally, the case of whole-plane SLEκ(ρ) for ρ > −2 with ρ (cid:54)= 2 − κ follows from the case of radial

In the case when κ ∈ (0, 4), we assume that η is parameterized by νh-length (which is well-deﬁned
by [She16, Theorem 1.3]). In the case when κ > 4, we assume that η is parameterized by half-plane capacity
and for t > 0 we let ηR
t be the be the right outer boundary of the hull generated by η([0, t]), viewed as a
curve from η(t) to the rightmost point of η([0, t]) ∩ R. By SLE duality, ηR
for a ﬁxed capacity time t > 0 is
an SLE16/κ-type curve. More precisely, the construction in [MS13, Sections 1.2.3 and 4.3] implies that we
can ﬁnd a chordal space-ﬁlling SLEκ curve η(cid:48) which traces points in the same order as η (in the case κ ≥ 8,
we have η(cid:48) = η and, when κ ∈ (4, 8), η(cid:48) can be obtained by iteratively ﬁlling in the “bubbles” disconnected
from ∞ by η). For t > 0 let σt be the time such that η(cid:48)([0, σt]) is the hull generated by η([0, t]) and for z ∈ H
let τz be the time when η(cid:48) hits z. Also let ´ηR

we note that Φκ = Φ16/κ). The radial version follows from the same argument but with the radial reverse
SLE/GFF coupling [MS16d, Theorem 5.1] used in place of [She16, Theorem 1.2]. The whole-plane case is
immediate from the radial case since for any s ∈ R, fs(η|[s,∞)) has the law of a radial SLEκ.

We next prove Theorem 1.3. The proof is similar to that of Theorem 1.1, but since we are interested in
a complementary connected component of the whole curve (rather than the curve run up to a ﬁxed time)
we use a quantum cone or a quantum wedge instead of a free-boundary GFF. There are minor additional
complications arising from the possibility that η intersects itself.
Proof of Theorem 1.3. Suppose we are in the whole-plane case and that κ ∈ (0, 4). We note that in this
case, η intersects itself (and hence has more than one complementary connected component) if and only

Since there are only countably many possible choices of U ∈ U, combining (2.5) and (2.6) yields the statement
of the theorem in the whole-plane case when κ ∈ (0, 4).
When κ ∈ (0, 4), the statement in the chordal case is proven via the same argument, except that we start

by SLE duality [Zha08, Zha10, Dub09, MS16a, MS13], ∂U ∩ η is an SLE16/κ-type curve, so we can apply
Theorem 2.1 in essentially the same manner as in the case when κ ∈ (0, 4). See the proof of Theorem 1.1 for
a similar argument.

3 Open questions

Here we list some open problems which are related to the main results of this paper.

1. Consider the following heuristic argument for computing the multifractal spectrum of SLE (originally
obtained rigorously in [GMS14]) using Theorem 1.3. Recall that the multifractal spectrum of, say, a

whole-plane SLEκ curve η is the function ξ = ξκ : [−1, 1] → [0,∞) deﬁned by ξ(s) = dimH(cid:101)Θs, where

(cid:26)

(cid:101)Θs :=

(cid:27)

x ∈ R : lim
→0

|f(cid:48)(x + i)|

log −1 = s

(cid:16)

Y ∩(cid:83)

t∈[s−δ,s+δ](cid:101)Θt(cid:17)

for f : H → C \ η a conformal map (it is easy to see that the deﬁnition of ξ does not depend on f ).

Suppose we are given a deterministic Borel set Y ⊂ R. The points of each set (cid:101)Θs should be evenly
spread out over R, and we know how much f expands small intervals centered at points of (cid:101)Θs. So, it

should be possible to derive a formula for dimH f
in terms of dimH(Y ), ξ, and
δ for each given s ∈ [−1, 1] and δ > 0. Sending δ → 0 and maximizing over s yields a formula for
dimH f (Y ) in terms of dimH Y and ξ. On the other hand, Theorem 1.3 gives a formula for dimH f (Y )
in terms of dimH Y and κ (for a large number of possible choices of f ). Comparing these two formulas
and letting dimH Y vary should allow one to recover ξ. Can the above argument be made rigorous?
2. Does the formula of Theorem 1.3 hold a.s. for every choice of the conformal map gU : H → U simulta-
neously? The proof of the theorem shows that to obtain an aﬃrmative answer to this question it would
be enough to show that for a ﬁxed choice of set X ⊂ [0,∞), the KPZ formula of [RV11, Theorem 4.1]
(c.f. [GHM15, Remark 1.2]) holds simultaneously a.s. for the image of X under every conformal map
H → H which sends X into [0,∞). Similarly, does the statement of Theorem 1.1 hold a.s. for all times
t simultaneously?

3. None of Theorems 1.1, 1.3, or 2.1 applies in the case when κ = 4. Can these theorems be extended to

the case κ = 4, possibly using critical (γ = 2) LQG [DRSV14a, DRSV14b]?

4. Is there a version of Theorem 2.1 for SLEκ with κ ∈ (4, 8) equipped with the quantum natural time
parameterization introduced in [DMS14]? (The so-called quantum natural time is the κ ∈ (4, 8) analog
of quantum length.) Note that the κ ≥ 8 version of Theorem 2.1 is the main result of [GHM15].

5. Is there a version of Theorem 2.1 for the so-called natural parameterization of SLE [LS11,LZ13,LR12].
(Note that quantum length, quantum natural time, and quantum area are respectively the Liouville
quantum gravity analogs of the natural parameterization for κ ∈ (0, 4), κ ∈ (4, 8), and κ ≥ 8.)
