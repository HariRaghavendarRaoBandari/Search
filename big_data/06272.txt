MAXIMAL TORUS THEORY FOR COMPACT QUANTUM GROUPS

TEODOR BANICA

Abstract. Associated to any compact quantum group G ⊂ U +

N is a canonical family

of “maximal tori” for G. We present here a series of conjectures, relating the various

of group dual subgroups bΓQ ⊂ G, parametrized by unitaries Q ∈ UN , playing the role
algebraic and analytic properties of G to those of the family {bΓQ|Q ∈ UN }.

Introduction

We investigate here the notion of “maximal torus” for the compact quantum groups.
In general, the maximal torus does not really exist. Given a closed subgroup G ⊂ U +
N ,

what does exist, however, is a family of group dual subgroups bΓQ ⊂ G, parametrized by

unitaries Q ∈ UN , which altogether play the role of the maximal torus.

The construction, which goes back to [1], [6], is very simple, as follows:

C∗(ΓQ) = C(G).D(QuQ∗)ij = 0, ∀i 6= jE

Here u is the fundamental corepresentation of G, and the key observation is that the

elements gi = (QuQ∗)ii are group-like in the quotient algebra on the right.

Based on growing evidence, coming from the recent quantum group literature, we will
formulate here a series of conjectures, relating the various algebraic and analytic properties

C(G)central is left nonzero in one of the quotients C∗(ΓQ).

(1) Character conjecture: Assuming that G is connected, any nonzero element P ∈

of G to those of the family {bΓQ|Q ∈ UN }. Our main statements are as follows:
(2) Amenability conjecture: The discrete quantum group bG is amenable if and only if
(3) Growth conjecture: The discrete quantum group bG has polynomial growth if and

all the discrete groups ΓQ are amenable.

only if each ΓQ has polynomial growth.

We believe all these conjectures to be true, non-trivial, and of course, of interest.
The paper is organized as follows: 1-2 are preliminary sections, in 3-4 we comment on

the above conjectures, and in 5-6 we discuss Tannakian aspects.

1. Maximal tori

We use Woronowicz’s compact quantum group formalism in [29], [30], with the extra

axiom S2 = id. The precise deﬁnition that we will need is as follows:

Deﬁnition 1.1. Assume that A is a C∗-algebra, and u ∈ MN (A) is a unitary matrix,
such that the following formulae deﬁne morphisms of C∗-algebras:

∆(uij) =Xk

uik ⊗ ukj

,

ε(uij) = δij

, S(uij) = u∗ji

We write then A = C(G), and call G a compact matrix quantum group.

The above maps ∆, ε, S are called comultiplication, counit and antipode. The basic
examples include the compact Lie groups G ⊂ UN , their q-deformations at q = −1, and
the duals of the ﬁnitely generated discrete groups Γ =< g1, . . . , gN >. See [20], [29].

We have as well the following key construction, due to Wang [27]:

Deﬁnition 1.2. The quantum groups O+

N , U +

N constructed via

C(O+

C(U +

N ) = C∗(cid:16)(uij)i,j=1,...,N(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)u = ¯u, ut = u−1(cid:17)
N ) = C∗(cid:16)(uij)i,j=1,...,N(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)u∗ = u−1, ut = ¯u−1(cid:17)

are called free analogues of ON , UN .

Here the existence of the morphisms ∆, ε, S, as in Deﬁnition 1.1, comes from the uni-
versality property of the above algebras. Observe that by dividing by the commuta-
tor ideal, we obtain respectively the algebras C(ON ), C(UN ). Thus, we have inclusions
ON ⊂ O+

N . These inclusions are far from being isomorphisms. See [27].

N , UN ⊂ U +

The notion of diagonal subgroup goes back to [6]. The idea is very simple:

Deﬁnition 1.3. Given a closed subgroup G ⊂ U +

N , we set

C∗(Γ1) = C(G).Duij = 0, ∀i 6= jE

with u ∈ MN (C(G)) being the fundamental corepresentation.

As explained in [6], the above quotient algebra is indeed cocommutative, and its gener-
ators gi = uii are group-like. Thus, Γ1 =< g1, . . . , gN > is a usual discrete group. Observe
that C∗(Γ1) is not necessarily the full group algebra of Γ1, but rather a certain quotient
of it. For simplicity of presentation, we will use however the notation C∗(Γ1).

Observe that in the classical case, G ⊂ UN , we obtain in this way the dual of the

diagonal torus, Γ1 = \G ∩ TN , with TN ⊂ UN being the group of diagonal unitaries.

A key extension of the above construction, obtained by using a “spinning” matrix

Q ∈ UN , was proposed in [1]. The idea is once again very simple, as follows:

MAXIMAL TORUS THEORY FOR COMPACT QUANTUM GROUPS

Deﬁnition 1.4. Given a closed subgroup G ⊂ U +

N , and a matrix Q ∈ UN , we set

C∗(ΓQ) = C(G).Dvij = 0, ∀i 6= jE

where v = QuQ∗, with u ∈ MN (C(G)) being the fundamental corepresentation.

Observe that for the identity matrix Q = 1 we obtain indeed the discrete group Γ1 from
Deﬁnition 1.3. In general, we do not really have a new notion here, because ΓQ is nothing
but the group Γ1 from Deﬁnition 1.3, taken for the quantum group (G, v).

The theoretical interest in this slight generalization of Deﬁnition 1.3 comes from the

following fundamental result, due to Woronowicz [29]:

Theorem 1.5. Any group dual subgroup bΛ ⊂ G must appear as

bΛ ⊂bΓQ ⊂ G

for a certain matrix Q ∈ UN .

N come from the quotient maps C(U +

N must appear as in the statement. See [1], [29].

Proof. As explained in [29], the ﬁnite dimensional unitary corepresentations of bΛ are

completely reducible, with the irreducible corepresentations being all 1-dimensional, cor-
responding to the group elements g ∈ Γ. Thus, such a corepresentation must be of the
form v = QwQ∗, with w = diag(g1, . . . , gN ) and Q ∈ UN . We conclude that the embed-

the subgroups bΛ ⊂ G ⊂ U +
Proposition 1.6. If the elements g1, . . . , gN ∈ ΓQ are pairwise distinct, then bΓQ ⊂ G is
Proof. By rotating, we can assume Q = 1. Given a subgroup bΓ1 ⊂ bΛ ⊂ G, let us

denote by w ← v ← u the corresponding fundamental corepresentations. We have then
v = P diag(h1, . . . , hN )P ∗, for a certain P ∈ UN , where h1, . . . , hN are the generators of
Λ. In addition, the quotient map Λ → Γ1 must send hi → gσ(i), for a certain permutation
σ ∈ SN . We deduce that w = diag(g1, . . . , gN ) commutes with R = σP , which reads
Rij(gi − gj) = 0, and so Rij = 0 for i 6= j. But this gives Λ = Γ1. See [6].
(cid:3)

We have as well the following related result, from [6]:

a maximal group dual subgroup.

The considerations in [6] were motivated by the root systems for half-classical quantum
groups. The general problem here, still open, can beneﬁt from the systematic approach
to half-liberation in [8]. We will be back to these topics in section 5 below.

As for the considerations in [1], these were motivated by a key rigidity conjecture in
noncommutative geometry [16], solved in the meantime by Goswami and Joardar [17].
The main observation in [1] was the fact that a non-classical group dual cannot act on a
compact Riemannian manifold. In view of [17], this is of course obsolete.

2. Basic examples

In this section we discuss,

following [1], some basic examples of the construction

(G, Q) → ΓQ from Deﬁnition 1.4. In the classical case, the result is as follows:

Proposition 2.1. For a closed subgroup G ⊂ UN we have

where TN ⊂ UN is the group of diagonal unitary matrices.

bΓQ = G ∩ (Q∗TN Q)

Proof. This is indeed clear at Q = 1, where Γ1 appears by deﬁnition as the dual of the
compact abelian group G ∩ TN . In general, this follows by conjugating by Q.
(cid:3)

Here are as well the computations for Wang’s quantum groups in [27]:

Proposition 2.2. The construction G → ΓQ is as follows:
N we obtain ΓQ = FN , for any Q ∈ UN .
N we have ΓQ = FN / < Rij 6= 0 =⇒ gigj = 1 >, where R = QQt.

(1) For G = U +
(2) For G = O+

Proof. These results are well-known, the proof being as follows:

(1) At Q = 1 this is clear, and in the general case Q ∈ UN this follows from Γ1 = FN ,

and from the fact that C(U +

N ) is isomorphic to itself via u → QuQ∗.

(2) At Q = 1 this is clear, and we obtain the group Γ1 = Z∗N

2 . In general now, with

v = QuQ∗, and with R = QQt as in the statement, we have:

¯v = QuQ∗ = ¯Q¯uQt = ¯QuQt = ¯QQ∗vQQt = R∗vR

Thus ΓQ is presented by the relations ¯w = R∗wR, with w = diag(g1, . . . , gN ). But
(cid:3)

(wR)ij = (R ¯w)ij with reads giRij = Rijg−1

, and this gives the result.

j

Following [1], we have as well the following result:

Proposition 2.3. When Γ = bG is classical, diagonally embedded, we have:

ΓQ = Γ/ < gi = gj|∃k, Qki 6= 0, Qkj 6= 0 >

A similar result holds for the arbitrary (non-diagonal) embeddings.

Proof. Assume indeed that Γ =< g1, . . . , gN > is a discrete group, with bΓ ⊂ U +

via u = diag(g1, . . . , gN ). With v = QuQ∗, we have:

N coming

Xs

¯Qsivsk =Xst

¯QsiQst ¯Qktgt =Xt

δit ¯Qktgt = ¯Qkigi

Thus the condition vij = 0 for i 6= j gives ¯Qkivkk = ¯Qkigi, which is the same as saying

that Qki 6= 0 implies gi = vkk. But this latter equality reads gi = Pj |Qkj|2gj, and we

conclude that Qki 6= 0, Qkj 6= 0 implies gi = gj, as desired. See [1].

(cid:3)

MAXIMAL TORUS THEORY FOR COMPACT QUANTUM GROUPS

In what follows we will regard the family {ΓQ|Q ∈ UN } as a kind of “bundle” over
the group UN . Observe that, by Proposition 2.3, we cannot expect the correspondence
Q → ΓQ to have any reasonable continuity property, and so our “bundle” structure to ﬁt
into some known formalism. In addition, we have the following negative result:

Proposition 2.4. When Γ = bG is a classical group, the ﬁbers ΓQ are trivial (in the sense

that they are quotients of Z), for generic values of Q ∈ UN .

Proof. This follows indeed from Proposition 2.3. To be more precise, we obtain that ΓQ
is trivial, with probability 1, with respect to the Haar measure on UN .
(cid:3)

The above result cuts short any attempt of using probabilistic tools, in order to “aver-
age” our family of groups {ΓQ|Q ∈ UN }. Would the ﬁbers have been generically non-trival,
we could have probably used [12] in order to average the various numeric invariants of
ΓQ, in order to obtain a unique, formal “maximal torus”. But, this is not the case.

Following now [14], we have as well the following result, which can provide counterex-

amples to some other various naive conjectures which can be made:

Proposition 2.5. For the quantum group of Kac-Paljutkin, and for its generalizations
by Sekine, the family {ΓQ|Q ∈ UN } consists of abelian groups.

Proof. This follows from the results of Franz and Skalski in [14], who classiﬁed all the
group dual subgroups of these quantum groups, from [25]. See [1].
(cid:3)

Finally, we have the following result, regarding Wang’s free analogue of the symmetric
group [28], which combines various ﬁndings from [1], [7], and which is perhaps the most
illustrating, for the various phenomena that can appear:

Theorem 2.6. For the quantum permutation group G = S+

N , we have:

(1) Given Q ∈ UN , the quotient FN → ΓQ comes from the following relations:

gi = 1
gigj = 1
gigjgk = 1




if Pl Qil 6= 0
if Pl QilQjl 6= 0
if Pl QilQjlQkl 6= 0

(2) Given a decomposition N = N1 + . . . + Nk, for the matrix Q = diag(FN1, . . . , FNk),

where FN = 1√N

(ξij)ij with ξ = e2πi/N is the Fourier matrix, we obtain:

ΓQ = ZN1 ∗ . . . ∗ ZNk

(3) Given an arbitrary matrix Q ∈ UN , there exists a decomposition N = N1+. . .+Nk,

such that ΓQ appears as quotient of ZN1 ∗ . . . ∗ ZNk .

Proof. Here (1) was obtained in [1], via a computation that we will generalize later on,
and (2) was obtained as well in [1], via a direct computation. As for (3), the result here
goes back to Bichon’s work in [7], and can be obtained as well from (1,2). See [1].
(cid:3)

The above result is quite interesting for us, because it shows that the ﬁbers ΓQ not
only wildly vary with Q, but are also not subject to quotient maps between them. This
phenomenon holds of course as well for SN itself, but the extension to S+
N is of interest,
because at N ≥ 4 this quantum group is known to be of “continuous” nature.

3. The conjectures

We present now our series of conjectures, relating the various algebraic and analytic

properties of G to those of the family {bΓQ|Q ∈ UN }. As already mentioned in the intro-

duction, while the general philosophy is quite old, going back to [1], [6], the conjectures
are new, based on a quite substantial amount of recent work in the area.

Let us ﬁrst recall that, according to the Peter-Weyl type theory in [29], the characters
of ﬁnite dimensional representations of G live in a certain subalgebra C(G)central ⊂ C(G).
To be more precise, C(G)central is by deﬁnition the norm closure of the linear span of the
characters of irreducible representations, known to be linearly independent.

We recall as well that G is said to be connected if it has no ﬁnite quantum group
quotient G → F 6= {1}. This is equivalent to the fact that the coeﬃcient algebra < rij >
is inﬁnite dimensional, for any ﬁnite dimensional unitary representation r. For group

duals, G =bΓ, this is the same as asking for Γ to have no torsion. See [11].

With this convention, our ﬁrst conjecture is as follows:

Conjecture 3.1 (Characters). If G is connected, for any nonzero P ∈ C(G)central there
exists Q ∈ UN such that πQ : C(G) → C∗(ΓQ) has the property πQ(P ) 6= 0.

Observe that this conjecture holds trivially when G = bΓ is a group dual, because we
can take here Q ∈ UN to be the spinning matrix which produces the embedding bΓ ⊂ U +

coming from Theorem 1.5 above, and we have πQ = id in this case.

The conjecture holds as well in the classical group case, because we can take here

N ,

Q ∈ UN to be such that QT Q∗ ⊂ TN , where T ⊂ UN is a maximal torus for G.

Observe that in both the above cases, we have in fact a matrix Q ∈ UN such that πQ is
faithful on C(G)central. In addition, the connectedness assumption is not really needed in
the group dual case, nor for most of the known examples of compact groups. Thus, there
are several potential ways of formulating some stronger conjectures.

At the analytic level now, our ﬁrst, and main conjecture, will concern amenability. Let
us recall from [29] that associated to any compact quantum group G are in fact sev-
eral Hopf C∗-algebras, including a maximal one Cmax(G), and a minimal one Cmin(G).
The compact quantum group G is said to be coamenable is the canonical quotient map

Cmax(G) → Cmin(G) is an isomorphism. Equivalently, the discrete quantum group Γ = bG

is called amenable when the canonical quotient map C∗max(G) → C∗min(G) is an isomor-
phism. With this convention, our conjecture is as follows:

Conjecture 3.2 (Amenability). G is coamenable if and only if each ΓQ is coamenable.

MAXIMAL TORUS THEORY FOR COMPACT QUANTUM GROUPS

Observe that =⇒ is trivial, because of the quotient map C(G) → C∗(ΓQ), which can

is not coamenable, then there exists Q ∈ UN such that ΓQ is not amenable.

Regarding now ⇐=, an equivalent statement here, a bit more convenient, is that if G

be interpreted as coming from a discrete quantum group quotient map bG → ΓQ.
Observe that this latter statement holds trivially in the group dual case, G =bΓ, because

we can take here Q ∈ UN to be the spinning matrix coming from Theorem 1.5, for which
πQ = id. The statement holds as well in the classical case, G ⊂ UN , due to the trivial
fact that these latter quantum groups are all coamenable. See [29].

As already mentioned, the above conjecture is our main analytic one. We believe that
the above statement is just the “tip of the iceberg”, with many other conjectures being
behind it, some of them regarding the ﬁne analytic structure of C(G), and some other,

regarding the ﬁne probabilistic structure of the Kesten measure of bG.

Regarding now the growth, let us recall from [4] that this is constructed by using the
balls in Irr(G), with respect to the distance coming from the fundamental corepresenta-
tion u, and with each corepresentation r contributing with a dim(r)2 factor.

With this convention, we have the following conjecture:

Conjecture 3.3 (Growth). bG has polynomial growth if and only if each ΓQ has polynomial

growth.

As before, the conjecture is trivial in the group dual case. In the classical group case the
conjecture holds as well, but this is not trivial, coming from [4] in the connected simply
connected case, and from the recent paper [13] in the general case.

Once again, we believe that this conjecture is just the “tip of the iceberg”. Here is as
series of more specialized statements, regarding the cardinality | . |, the polynomial growth
exponents p(.), and the exponential growth exponents e(.):

log log |G| ≃ sup
Q∈UN

p(bG) ≈ sup
log e(bG) ≈ sup

Q∈UN

Q∈UN

log log |ΓQ|

p(ΓQ)

log e(ΓQ)

These statements are all trivial in the group dual case, with equality everywhere. In
the classical group case, the ﬁrst estimate is what seems to come out from the existent
literature, and the second estimate is non-trivial, but holds by [13]. Finally, regarding the
last estimate, this is supported by the various computations in [4].

We present here some general results, supporting the conjectures made in section 3. As

a ﬁrst statement, collecting the various observations made above, we have:

4. General results

8

TEODOR BANICA

Proposition 4.1. The 3 conjectures hold for the classical groups, and for the group duals.

Proof. This follows as explained in the previous section, the summary being;

(1) Characters: trivial for group duals, holds as well for classical groups.
(2) Amenability: trivial for both group duals, and for classical groups.
(3) Growth: trivial for group duals, nontrivial cf. [13] for classical groups.

(cid:3)

By getting back now to the precise justiﬁcations in section 3, observe that for the group
duals, the argument was basically always the same, namely that we can take Q ∈ UN to
be the spinning matrix coming from Theorem 1.5, for which πQ = id.

Our aim now is to analyse and further extend this phenomenon. The deﬁnition that

we will need, capturing the fact that “only one Q is needed”, is as follows:

Deﬁnition 4.2. A compact quantum group G ⊂ U +
L ∈ UN such that we have a quotient map ΓL → ΓQ, for any Q ∈ UN .

N is called “tame” when there exists

Observe that, by changing the fundamental corepresentation, we can always assume

that our tame quantum groups are “normalized”, with L = 1.

At the level of examples, any group dual is tame. Also, any compact connected Lie

group is tame. As a basic counterexample, SN is not tame, and nor is S+
N .
In the tame case, our conjectures have “lighter” formulations, as follows:

Proposition 4.3. When G is tame and normalized, the conjectures are as follows:

(1) Characters: π1 : C(G) → C∗(Γ1) is injective on C(G)central.
(2) Amenability: G is coamenable if and only if Γ1 is amenable.

(3) Growth: bG has polynomial growth if and only if Γ1 has polynomial growth.

Proof. This follows indeed from deﬁnitions, by using the quotient maps Γ1 → ΓQ coming
from the tameness assumption.
(cid:3)

It would be of course interesting to know more about the tame quantum groups. The

problem here is that it is very unclear where the maps ΓL → ΓQ should come from.

at N = 4, observe that Theorem 2.6 gives, with Q = diag(F2, F2), the discrete group

and the algebra C(G)central is polynomial on χ = Pi uii. In order to solve the problem
ΓQ = Z2 ∗ Z2 = D∞. Since T r(u) = T r(Q∗uQ), the image of χ =Pi uii in the quotient

C∗(ΓQ) is the variable ρ = 2 + g + h, where g, h are the generators of the two copies of
Z2. Now since this latter variable generates a polynomial algebra, we obtain the result.
Finally, at N ≥ 5 the result follows by functoriality from the result at N = 4.

Regarding now G = H +

N , here it is known from [5] that C(G)central is polynomial on the
variables χ =Pi uii and χ′ =Pi u2

[1], with Q = F2 we have ΓQ = D∞. Let us compute now the images ρ, ρ′ of the variables
χ, χ′ in the group algebra of D∞. As before, from T r(u) = T r(Q∗uQ) we obtain ρ = g +h,
where g, h are the generators of the two copies of Z2. Regarding now ρ′, let us ﬁrst recall
that the quotient map C(H +

3 = S3, the growth is exponential, and the estimate log e(bG) ≈ supQ∈UN log e(ΓQ)

(cid:3)

We can see from the above proof that the veriﬁcation of the conjectures basically

requires to know how to compute ΓQ, and to know the representation theory of G.

There are many other situations where these two technical ingredients are available, at
least to some extent. Without getting into details here, let us just mention that: (1) the
product operations ×, ˆ∗ can be investigated by using [27], (2) the free complexiﬁcation
operation can be investigated by using [22], (3) for deformations, evidence comes from [9],
[21], (4) for free wreath products, evidence comes from [18], (5) the two-parametric free
quantum groups can be studied by using [2], and (6) for the various growth conjectures,
substantial evidence comes from the computations in [4], [13].

In short, there is a lot of work to be done. In what follows we will do a part of this

work, in relation with two key constructions, coming from Tannakian philosophy.

5. Half-liberation

One interesting discovery coming from Tannakian philosophy is the fact that the com-
mutation relations ab = ba can be succesfully replaced, in relation with several quantum
group questions, with the half-commutation relations abc = cba. Diagramatically:

Deﬁnition 5.1. The half-classical orthogonal group O∗N is given by:

C(O∗N ) = C(O+

N ).Dabc = cba, ∀a, b, c ∈ {uij}E

The closed quantum subgroups G ⊂ O∗N are called half-classical.

To be more precise now, this deﬁnition is motivated by a result from [6], stating that
there are exactly 3 categories of pairings, namely those generated by ∅, /\, /\| . Equivalently,
there are exactly 3 orthogonal easy quantum groups, namely:

ON ⊂ O∗N ⊂ O+
N

We will be back to these topics in section 6 below. For the moment, we will just use

Deﬁnition 5.1 as it is, and we refer to [3], [6] for where this deﬁnition comes from.

We will prove here that the 3 conjectures hold for any half-classical quantum group. In

order to do so, we can use the modern approach from [8], which is as follows:

MAXIMAL TORUS THEORY FOR COMPACT QUANTUM GROUPS

11

Proposition 5.2. Given a conjugation-stable closed subgroup H ⊂ UN , consider the
algebra C([H]) ⊂ M2(C(H)) generated by the following variables:

uij =(cid:18) 0

¯vij

vij

0(cid:19)

Then [H] is a compact quantum group, we have [H] ⊂ O∗N , and any non-classical subgroup
G ⊂ O∗N appears in this way, with G = O∗N itself appearing from H = UN .
Proof. The 2 × 2 matrices in the statement are self-adjoint, half-commute, and the N × N
matrix u = (uij) that they form is orthogonal, so we have an embedding [H] ⊂ O∗N .
The quantum group property of [H] is also elementary to check, by using an alternative,
equivalent construction, with a quantum group embedding as follows:

C([H]) ⊂ C(H) ⋊ Z2

The surjectivity part is non-trivial, and we refer here to [8].

(cid:3)

We will need as well the following result, also from [8]:

Proposition 5.3. We have a bijection Irr([H]) ≃ Irr0(H)` Irr1(H), where
Irrk(H) =nr ∈ Irr(H)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)∃l ∈ N, r ∈ u⊗k ⊗ (u ⊗ ¯u)⊗lo
induced by the canonical identiﬁcation Irr(H ⋊ Z2) ≃ Irr(H)` Irr(H).

Proof. We have an equality of projective versions P [H] = P H, and so an inclusion
Irr0(H) = Irr(P H) ⊂ Irr([H]). The remaining irreducible representations of [H] must
come from an inclusion Irr1(H) ⊂ Irr([H]), appearing as above. See [8].
(cid:3)

Regarding now the maximal tori, the situation is very simple, as follows:

Proposition 5.4. The group dual subgroups c[Γ]Q ⊂ [H] appear via
from the group dual subgroups bΓQ ⊂ H associated to H ⊂ UN .

[Γ]Q = [ΓQ]

Proof. By using the crossed product picture, the operation H → [H] constructed in
Proposition 5.2 is functorial, and in particular we have the following diagram:

C([H]) ⊂ C(H) ⋊ Z2

↓

↓

C([ΓQ]) ⊂ C(ΓQ) ⋊ Z2

Thus we have an identiﬁcation of discrete groups [Γ]Q = [ΓQ], as claimed.

(cid:3)

Now back to our conjectures, we have the following result:

12

TEODOR BANICA

Theorem 5.5. The 3 conjectures hold for any half-classical quantum group.

Proof. We already know from Proposition 4.1 that the conjectures hold for any closed
subgroup G ⊂ ON , so we can assume that we have G ⊂ O∗N , G 6⊂ ON .

According to Proposition 5.2, we have G = [H], for a certain conjugation-stable sub-
group H ⊂ UN . By using once again Proposition 4.1, we know that the conjectures hold
for H ⊂ UN . The idea will be that of “transporting” these results, via H → [H]:

(1) Characters. Assuming that [H] ⊂ O∗N is connected, it follows from Proposition 5.3
that H ⊂ UN is connected as well. Thus, we can pick a maximal torus T = ΓQ for the
compact group H ⊂ UN , and by using the formula [Γ]Q = [ΓQ] = [T ] from Proposition
5.4, we obtain the result, via the identiﬁcation in Proposition 5.3.

(2) Amenability. There is nothing to be proved here, because O∗N is coamenable, and
so are all its quantum subgroups. Note however, in relation with the comments made in
section 3 above, that in the connected case, the Kesten measures of G, [T ] are intimately
related. For some explicit formulae here, for G = O∗N itself, see [3].

(3) Growth. Here the situation is similar, because by Proposition 5.3 above, [H] has
polynomial growth. As a comment, one can transport the results from [13], via the
identiﬁcation in Proposition 5.3, as to obtain precise exponent estimates.
(cid:3)

Summarizing, we have extended to the half-classical setting the results regarding the
compact groups G ⊂ ON . Interesting would be to have a full extension of the classical
results, with a statement covering all the closed subgroups G ⊂ UN . This looks possible,
but the general half-liberation theory here is not available yet.

6. Tannakian aspects

In this section we present a systematic Tannakian approach to our various conjectures.

Our starting point is the following result, coming from Woronowicz’s work in [30]:

Proposition 6.1. Given an inclusion G ⊂ O+
corepresentations denoted u → w, we have the following formula:

N , with the corresponding fundamental

C(G) = C(O+

N ).(cid:16)T ∈ Hom(u⊗k, u⊗l), ∀k, l ∈ N, ∀T ∈ Hom(w⊗k, w⊗l)(cid:17)

A similar result holds in the unitary case, by assuming that k, l are “colored” integers,
with the tensor powers v⊗k, v⊗l being obtained by tensoring v, ¯v.

Proof. This follows indeed from [30]. For a short, recent proof, see [19].

(cid:3)

Regarding now the tori, at this level of generality, we have the following result:

Proposition 6.2. The intertwining formula T ∈ Hom(u⊗k, u⊗l), with u = QvQ∗, where
v = diag(g1, . . . , gN ), is equivalent to the collection of conditions

one for each choice of the multi-indices i, j, where T Q = (Q∗)⊗lT Q⊗k.

(T Q)j1...jl,i1...ik 6= 0 =⇒ gi1 . . . gik = gj1 . . . gjl

MAXIMAL TORUS THEORY FOR COMPACT QUANTUM GROUPS

13

Proof. Observe ﬁrst that, by conjugating by Q, we have the following formula:

T ∈ Hom(u⊗k, u⊗l) ⇐⇒ T Q ∈ Hom(v⊗k, v⊗l)

Thus, it is enough to prove the result at Q = 1. And here, with standard multi-index

notations, including the convention gi = gi1 . . . gik, the computation goes as follows:

T ∈ Hom(u⊗k, u⊗l) ⇐⇒ T u⊗kei = u⊗lT ei, ∀i

⇐⇒ T ei ⊗ gi = u⊗lXj
Tjiej ⊗ gi =Xj
⇐⇒ Xj

Tjiej, ∀i

Tjiej ⊗ gj, ∀i

⇐⇒ Tjigi = Tjigj, ∀i, j
⇐⇒ [Tji 6= 0 =⇒ gi = gj], ∀i, j

Thus we have obtained the relation in the statement, and we are done.

(cid:3)

In principle Propositions 6.1 and 6.2 give all the needed ingredients for a Tannakian

approach to our conjectures. Obviously, there is a lot of work to be done here.

Let us discuss now the easy case, where more concrete results can be obtained. We
use the framework of [26]. Let P (k, l) be the set of partitions between an upper row of
k points, and a lower row of l points, with each leg colored black or white, and with k, l
standing for the corresponding “colored integers”. We have then:

Deﬁnition 6.3. A category of partitions is a collection of sets D = Skl D(k, l), with

D(k, l) ⊂ P (k, l), which contains the identity, and is stable under:

(1) The horizontal concatenation operation ⊗.
(2) The vertical concatenation ◦, after deleting closed strings in the middle.
(3) The upside-down turning operation ∗ (with reversing of the colors).

As explained in [19], [26], such categories produce quantum groups. To be more precise,

associated to any partition π ∈ P (k, l) is the following linear map:

Tπ(ei1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ eik ) = Xj:ker(i

j )≤π

ej1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ ejl

Here the kernel of a multi-index (i

j) = (i1...ik
sets of equal indices. Thus, the condition ker(i
must join equal indices. With this construction in hand, we have:

j1...jl ) is the partition obtained by joining the
j) ≤ π simply tells us that the strings of π

Deﬁnition 6.4. A compact quantum group G ⊂ U +

N is called easy when

for any k, l, for a certain category of partitions D ⊂ P .

Hom(u⊗k, u⊗l) = span(cid:16)Tπ(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)π ∈ D(k, l)(cid:17)

14

In other words, the easiness condition states that the Schur-Weyl dual of G comes in the
simplest possible way: from partitions. As a basic example, according to an old result of
Brauer [10], the group G = UN is easy, with D = P2 being the category of color-matching
pairings. Easy as well is U +
N , with D = NC2 ⊂ P2 being the category of noncrossing
color-matching pairings. See [3], [6], [15], [19], [24], [26].
With these conventions, we have the following result:

Theorem 6.5. In the uncolored case, the intertwining formula Tπ ∈ Hom(u⊗k, u⊗l), with
u = QvQ∗, where v = diag(g1, . . . , gN ), is equivalent to

with the generalized Kronecker symbols being given by δQ

β , with:

δQ

j1 . . . jl(cid:19) 6= 0 =⇒ gi1 . . . gik = gj1 . . . gjl
π(cid:18)i1 . . . ik
π =Qβ∈π δQ

Qsi1 . . . Qsir

¯Qsj1 . . . ¯Qsjp

δQ
1r

j1 . . . jp(cid:19) =Xs
p(cid:18)i1 . . . ir

A similar result holds is the colored case, with the convention g• = g−1.
Proof. With multi-index notations, as in the proof of Proposition 6.2, we have:

T Q
π (ei) = (Q∗)⊗lTπQ⊗kei

= Xs
= Xs
= Xstj

(Q∗)⊗lTπ(Q⊗k)sies

(Q∗)⊗l(Q⊗k)siXt
δπ(cid:18)s

t(cid:19)et
δπ(cid:18)s
t(cid:19)(Q⊗k)si((Q∗)⊗l)jtej

Thus, with full indices now, we have the following formula:

(T Q

π )j1...jl,i1...ik = Xs1...sk Xt1...tl

δπ(cid:18)s1 . . . sk

t1 . . . tl(cid:19)Qs1i1 . . . Qskik

¯Qt1j1 . . . ¯Qtljl

Since this quantity is multiplicative with respect to the blocks of π, by decomposing
(cid:3)

over these blocks, we obtain the formula in the statement.

Observe that the above result generalizes the computation in Theorem 2.6. In view of
the similarities with Proposition 2.3, one interesting question, that we would like to raise
here, is that of extending Theorem 6.5, as to cover Proposition 2.3 as well.

At a more concrete level now, the orthogonal easy quantum groups were classiﬁed by

Raum and Weber in [24]. Without getting into details here, let us mention that:

MAXIMAL TORUS THEORY FOR COMPACT QUANTUM GROUPS

(1) The classical examples are covered by Proposition 4.1. The free examples consist
N and
N , which appear as free versions of S′N = SN × Z2, BN ≃ ON−1 and of

of the quantum groups S+
B′+
N , B′′+
B′N ≃ ON−1 × Z2, taken twice, where the methods for S+
(2) Then, we have a number of half-liberations, covered by Theorem 5.5, and an
uncountable family, constructed in [23]. For this latter family we can use the

N from Theorem 4.4, and then of S′+

N apply.

N , B+

N , H +

N , O+

N , O+

we conclude that our various conjectures hold indeed.

(3) Finally, we have a last series, constructed in [24]. Here the quantum groups

diagonal group dual subgroup bΓ1, and by using the crossed product picture in [23]
are not coamenable, and nor are their diagonal group dual subgroups bΓ1, so the

amenability and growth conjectures are both satisﬁed. The remaining problem
regards the character conjecture, and we have no results here.

In the easy unitary case, where the classiﬁcation so far is only available in the classical
and free cases [26], the situation is quite unclear. Regarding amenability, an idea here
would be that of trying to relate the Kesten coamenability of G to the random walk on
the various groups ΓQ, with the restrictions on these latter random walks coming from
the formula in Theorem 6.5. However, this looks like a quite technical task.
