ABSTRACT

Context. We present the results of a survey to detect low-mass companions of UMa group members, carried out in 2003-2006 with
NACO at the ESO VLT. While many extra-solar planets and planetary candidates have been found in close orbits around stars by
the radial velocity and the transit method, direct detections at wider orbits are rare. The Ursa Major (UMa) group, a young stellar
association at an age of about 200-600 Myr and an average distance of 25 pc, has not yet been addressed as a whole although its
members represent a very interesting sample to search for and characterize sub-stellar companions by direct imaging.
Aims. Our goal was to ﬁnd or to provide detection limits on wide sub-stellar companions around nearby UMa group members using
high-resolution imaging.
Methods. We searched for faint companions around 20 UMa group members within 30 pc. The primaries were placed below a semi-
transparent coronagraph, a rather rarely used mode of NACO, to increase the dynamic range of the images. In most cases, second
epoch images of companion candidates were taken to check whether they share common proper motion with the primary.
Results. Our coronagraphic images rule out sub-stellar companions around the stars of the sample. A dynamical range of typically
13-15 mag in the Ks band was achieved at separations beyond 3" from the star. Candidates as faint as Ks ≈ 20 were securely identiﬁed
and measured. The survey is most sensitive between separations of 100 and 200 au but only on average because of the very diﬀerent
target distance. Field coverage reaches about 650 au for the most distant targets. Most of the 200 candidates are visible in two epochs.
All of those were rejected being distant background objects.

1. Introduction

By now almost 1,300 brown dwarfs have been found, classiﬁed
with spectral types L, T, and Y (Kirkpatrick 2008; Cushing et al.
2011)1. This number has been surpassed by indirect detections in
the planetary regime – by now more than 600 by radial velocity
variations and more than 1,200 by the transit method.2

While indirect methods are most sensitive to objects in very
close orbits around the targets, direct imaging detects objects in
wider orbits and thus is complementary. Ideally, direct imag-
ing is combined with simultaneous measurement of the radial

velocity variation (Guenther et al. 2005). Young sub-stellar ob-
jects still contract and are self-luminous (Burrows et al. 1997)
so that their direct detection is less diﬃcult up to ages of a
few hundred Myr (Malkov et al. 1998; Neuhäuser & Schmidt
2012). In contrast to high-resolution imaging in space (e.g.
Marengo et al. 2006), ground-based observations need to en-
compass the seeing which can be done with adaptive optics (e.g.
Neuhäuser et al. 2003; Duchêne et al. 2007). Coronagraphy with
intransparent (e.g. McCarthy & Zuckerman 2004, Chauvin et al.
2005) or semi-transparent coronagraphs (e.g. Biller et al. 2010;
Boccaletti et al. 2013, Guenther et al. 2005; Itoh et al. 2006,
2008a; Neuhäuser et al. 2007, Wahhaj et al. 2011) shade the
bright star so that the exposure time and thus the sensitivity
of the images can be increased. A number of very sophisti-
cated techniques have been developed recently (see the review
by Fischer et al. 2014).

The frequency of low-mass companions to stars gives impor-
tant clues regarding our understanding of the formation of brown
dwarfs and planets (Ida & Lin 2004; Alibert et al. 2005; Broeg
2007). At wide orbits, where direct imaging surveys are sensi-
tive, the frequency of brown dwarfs is of the order of several per-
cent for host stars with spectral types A-M and is less constrained
for giant planets (Rameau et al. 2013; Bowler et al. 2015). In
young nearby associations Neuhäuser & Guenther (2004) mea-
sure a frequency of 6 ± 4 % of sub-stellar companions which is
not very diﬀerent from the value of 1 ± 1 % obtained for isolated
late-type stars (McCarthy & Zuckerman 2004). The frequency
of brown dwarfs around Hyades members does not turn out very
diﬀerent from the latter (Guenther et al. 2005; Bouvier et al.
2008, Lodieu et al. 2014) although the Hyades are still young
with an age of ≈600 Myr. In the younger Pleiades (125 Myr),
Yamamoto et al. (2013) conﬁrmed two brown dwarf companions
in a sample of 20 stars.

Young moving groups of an age intermediate between the
Pleiades and the Hyades oﬀer interesting opportunities to study
homogeneous samples of common age and origin. No sub-
stellar companions have been found in the Her-Lyr assioci-
ation (Eisenbeiss et al. 2007, Biller et al. 2013) which has an
age of ≈250 Myr, similar to the UMa group (Eisenbeiss et al.
the UMa group
2013). Although a systematic survey of
at high resolution has been missing,
low-mass companions
have been detected: GJ 569 Ba, Bb (Martín et al. 2000;
Zapatero Osorio et al. 2004), HD 130948 B & C, (Potter et al.
2002), and χ1 Ori B (König et al. 2002)3. The only known
planet around a probable UMa group member, ǫ Eri, was found
by radial velocity variations (Hatzes et al. 2000; Benedict et al.
2006). Although there are still doubts about
its existence
(Zechmeister et al. 2013), there are even suspections of a second
planet (Quillen & Thorndike 2002; Deller & Maddison 2005).
The planet(s) of ǫ Eri have been subject to many, yet unsuccess-
ful, attempts of direct detection (Itoh et al. 2006; Janson et al.
2007; Marengo et al. 2006; Neuhäuser & Schmidt 2012, and the
present work).

The goal of the present work is to ﬁnd additional sub-stellar
companions in the UMa group by direct imaging. The search for
close and faint companions in the UMa group beneﬁts from a rel-
atively young age of 200-600 Myrs 4, the small distance of mem-
bers (≈50 pc on average; Fig. 1), and thus the availability of pre-
cise Hipparcos astrometry (Perryman et al. 1997; van Leeuwen
2007). Furthermore, the proper motion of UMa group mem-
bers is high on average (≈50 mas/yr) because of their proximity
(Fig. 1) and their peculiar space motion (Ammler 2006). Hence,
co-moving companions can be identiﬁed already after a short
epoch diﬀerence. Preliminary results of the present study have
been published earlier (Ammler-von Eiﬀ et al. 2009).

2. Coronagraphic observations and data reduction

As the deﬁnition of the UMa group and the list of members is
controversial, we compiled the targets in the following way to

3 It is worth noting that Bannister & Jameson (2007) identiﬁed one T
dwarf and three L dwarfs in the UMa group using the moving cluster
method.
4 The Ursa Major (UMa) has been studied extensively under vari-
ous aspects (e.g. Eggen 1994; Montes et al. 2001; King et al. 2003;
Fuhrmann 2004; Ammler 2006) but the precise age and the list of
members are still a matter of debate. Age estimates range from 200
to 600 Myrs (König et al. 2002; King et al. 2003; Fuhrmann 2004;
King & Schuler 2005; Brandt & Huang 2015).

Fig. 1. Left: distribution of distance and proper motion. The major con-
centration of the UMa group is the UMa open cluster in the Big Dipper
constellation at distances of about 25 pc. All known members and can-
didates (see references in the text) are included in the histogram (solid
line; distances mostly from Montes et al. 2001 and van Leeuwen 2007).
We add the distribution of the southern stars within 30 pc addressed in
the present work (hatched; distances from van Leeuwen 2007). Right:
an image of the coronagraphic mask with the four coronagraphs (black
ﬁlled circles) taken with the S27 camera. Each of the coronagraphs has
an angular diameter of 0.′′7. We placed the star below the lower left
(south-eastern) coronagraph, so that a ﬁeld with a radius of ≈9" is com-
pletely covered outside the coronagraph (hatched circle). Incomplete
coverage is achieved up to separations of ≈25" (arrow).

get a meaningful number of reliable UMa group members closer
than 30 pc and observable with NACO at the ESO VLT:

– stars found by Montes et al. (2001) to fulﬁl at least one of

Eggen’s kinematic criteria (Eggen 1995).

– certain or probable members compiled by King et al. (2003)
based on photometric, kinematic, and spectroscopic criteria.
– HD 135599 which is an UMa group member according to

Fuhrmann (2004).

One system, GJ 569 (=HIP 72944), we did not observe since
it has been extensively studied before (e.g. Simon et al. 2006).
Some objects were excluded because of known bright secon-
daries in the ﬁeld of view (HD 24916, HD 29875, HD 98712, and
HD 134083). HIP 104383 A is a close binary, too, but fully ﬁts
below the coronagraph so that we did observe it (Fig. D.1), i.e.
20 targets in total (Tables A.1 and A.2).

The targets have been observed with NACO, the adap-
tive optics imager at the Nasmyth platform of the ESO VLT
UT4 (Yepun)5. The stars themselves were used as adaptive op-
tics reference stars for the visual wavefront sensor of NAOS
(VIS). First epoch images were taken in 2003/2004 (programmes
072.C-0485, 073.C-0225) and second epoch imaging followed
in 2005/2006 (programmes 076.C-777, 077.C-0268) for those
stars with faint companion candidates identiﬁed.

The semi-transparent coronagraph is a rarely used NACO
mode. It has a diameter of 0.′′7 and dims the incoming stellar
light by about 6 magnitudes in the K band (see Fig. 1). Hence,
it blocks most light of the star but still allows one to do precise
astrometry with the stellar point spread function (PSF).

The observations have been obtained in the Ks band
(Persson et al. 1998; Tokunaga et al. 2002) further reducing the
brightness diﬀerence of stars and any low-mass companions. The
sensitivity of the observations has been further improved by not
using the S13 camera with the smallest pixel scale but instead
observing with the S27 camera (27.15 mas/pix, FOV 28"x28").

5 NACO consists of the adaptive optics system NAOS (Lenzen et al.
2003) and the camera CONICA (Rousset et al. 2003). The instrument
was decommissioned in August 2013 and recommissioned on UT1 in
January 2015.

Fig. 2. Left: based on Hipparcos data (cf. Tables E.2, A.1, and A.2), this
example of HD 22049 shows how the relative motion of non-moving
background stars in right ascension (solid lines) and declination (dashed
lines) will diﬀer from a comoving companion (respective horizontal
lines). The lines encompass the Hipparcos uncertainty, scaled by a fac-
tor of 100 for visibility. Possible orbital motion of a hypothetical com-
panion has been neglected. The vertical dotted lines highlight the dates
of the 1st and 2nd epoch exposures, respectively. Obviously, the two can-
didates found are background objects (circles for right ascension and
squares for declination, resp.; see Table D.2 and Fig. C.1). Right: dy-
namic range curves for a 10 σ detection as a function of angular sepa-
ration for all exposures of the survey.

This way, a larger ﬁeld is covered (Fig. 1) and more light is col-
lected in a single pixel. The astrometric precision using the S27
camera is suﬃcient since the average proper motion of the UMa
group of 150 mas (Fig. 1) per year corresponds to 5.5 pixels on
the detector.

The data reduction follows the usual steps of sky subtraction,
ﬂat-ﬁeld correction, bad pixel correction, shift and add6. The sky
has been subtracted using jittered exposures of nearby sky posi-
tions free of bright stars. The ﬂat-ﬁeld correction is based on
coronagraphic night-time ﬂat-ﬁeld exposures to correct for the
variable transmittance of the coronagraphic substrate and stan-
dard day-time exposures to correct for pixel-to-pixel variations
of the detector below the coronagraph used. Bad pixel frames
have been taken from standard calibrations or derived individu-
ally with ESO tools and standard twilight ﬂat-ﬁeld exposures.

3. Identiﬁcation and characterisation of candidates

The stellar PSF has been subtracted in a box of 500x500 pixels
centred on the star to facilitate the visual identiﬁcation of faint
companion candidates. The PSF has been derived by calculat-
ing the average of a set of rotated frames (in steps of 2◦) and
using sigma-clipping to get rid of bright features, in particular
the diﬀraction spikes. A smoothed image has been subtracted to
further facilitate detection (Figs C.1-C.5)7.

We noticed that artefacts due to dust particles on the coro-
nagraphic substrate can be mistaken for companion candidates.
The ﬂat-ﬁeld correction fails in removing those since occasional
displacements of the coronagraphic substrate can occur between
calibration and target exposures. We removed those artefacts
from the list of companion candidates guided by a visual cross-
match of the scientiﬁc exposures with the ﬂat-ﬁeld exposures. In
the most extreme cases (exposures of HD 11171 and HD 22049),
several tens of artefacts had to be removed.

6 using own scripts and tools provided by ESO, including ESO-eclipse
v5.0.0, the jitter recipe (Devillard 1997, 2011), and esorex using the
recipe naco_img_twﬂat to derive bad pixel frames.
7 Smoothing has been done by the application of a Gaussian ﬁlter
(FILTER/GAUSS in ESO MIDAS version 13SEP; Banse et al. 1983;
Warmels 1992) using all adjacent pixels within a radius of 18 pixels
weighted by a Gaussian with a width of σ = 3 pixels.

A wide comoving companion will not change its position
relative to the star while a distant and thus non-moving back-
ground object will reﬂect the stellar parallactic and proper mo-
tion (Fig. 2). Our assessment of astrometric measurement uncer-
tainties is based on Chauvin et al. (2010) who give a long-term
average of the S27 pixel scale of 27.012 ± 0.004 mas/pix and
of the detector position angle (true North) of −0.◦04 ± 0.◦14. In
the present work, we corrected the position angles of all candi-
dates for the mean deviation of −0.◦04 from the true North. From
the measurements obtained by Chauvin et al. (2010), we expect
uncertainties of 0.016 mas/pix on separation and 0.◦15 on posi-
tion angle. We neglected the errors in ﬁtting Gaussian proﬁles to
measure the positions of the stars and the candidates. It is as pre-
cise as a few milliarcseconds and of the order of the Hipparcos
errors (Table E.2).

The instrumental magnitudes of the target stars and the can-
didates have all been measured in apertures of 13 pixels across
which is more than double the typical FWHM of the PSF. Then,
the Ks band magnitude of the candidates has been derived from
the measured ﬂux ratios taking into account the brightness of the
target star (Table A.2) and the attenuation of the coronagraph.
While the brightness of the star has been measured in the reduced
frames, the brightness of the candidates has been measured in the
PSF-subtracted frames constructed in the way described above.
To calibrate the transmission of the coronagraph, a standard
star (HD 1274) was taken during the programme 384.C-0245A,
once outside and once below the coronagraph, and reduced in
the same way as the exposures of the science targets. The ﬂux
values have been integrated within apertures of 19 pixels radius
which ﬁts well inside the coronagraph. Relating the measure-
ments inside and outside the coronagraph gives a transmission
of 0.47 ± 0.03 % in the Ks band which translates to a dimming
of 5.83 ± 0.06 mag. The error bar accounts for uncertainties in-
volved in the aperture photometry but not for other systematics
like cross-talk, light-leaks, temporal variation of the PSF, im-
proper/variable placement of the star below the coronagraph, or
variable residual absorption by the transparent substrate which
carries the coronagraphs. The new measurement gives a dim-
ming weaker by half a magnitude than the value given in the
NACO manual (Ks = 6.3 ± 0.1 mag). The latter measurement
was done in a way similar to the present work but using frames
reduced in a diﬀerent way and using peak counts instead of aper-
ture photometry (ESO, priv. comm.). A conservative estimate of
6.1 ± 0.3 has been adopted in the present work since the discrep-
ancy cannot be explained with the data available.

For each one of the companion candidates, the average mag-
nitude of two epochs has been adopted and the uncertainty is
given by half their diﬀerence plus the square-added error bar
of 0.3 mag of the transmissivity of the coronagraph. For single-
epoch images, the transmissivity is the only well-known domi-
nant source of error.

4. Assessment of ﬁeld coverage and detection

limits

We could not take advantage of the full ﬁeld of view of the
NACO mode applied (28”x28”) since the corners are aﬀected
by obstructions. Furthermore, the coronagraphs themselves are
insensitive patches in the ﬁeld of view.

The ﬁeld of view is covered completely between angular
separations of 0.′′35 (coronagraphic radius) and 9.′′0 which cor-
respond to diﬀerent linear scales depending on the distance of
the star. The parallaxes of the sample stars vary from 37 mas

Article number, page 3 of 25

A&Aproofs: manuscript no. non_detect_v6.3.1_arXiv

(HIP 104383) to 311 mas (HD 22049) so that the ﬁeld of view
covers very diﬀerent parts of the stellar environments, e.g. the
closest view in the case of ǫ Eri (=HD 22049; 1.1 − 29 au) and
the farthest view for HIP 104383 (9.2−237 AU) (Table B.1). The
expected widest bound orbit of low-mass companions has been
estimated based on the linear law given in Close et al. 2003 given
the central mass of the target systems.

Although the ﬁeld of view is complete only up to separations
of ∼9”, it samples separations of up to ∼25” corresponding to as
much as ∼650 au in the case of HD 125451 and HIP 104383. Still
the ﬁeld of view never reaches the widest possible bound orbit in
the present sample. We note, however, that inclination is a free
parameter in this whole consideration and that measured separa-
tions are projected separations. Stars with exoplanets are known
for which very wide (up to one third of a parsec) companions
with common proper motion have been detected (Mugrauer et al.
2014).

To understand the detection limits in the wings of the PSF,
we built noise maps from the reduced and PSF-subtracted im-
ages. We measured the standard deviation at each pixel using 7x7
adjacent pixels. This value has been multiplied by the square root
of the number of pixels in an aperture of 13 pixels across in or-
der to compare to the photometric ﬂux measurements described
above.

Based on the noise analysis, the limiting magnitudes have
been derived relative to the magnitude of the primary star in the
same way as by Brandeker et al. (2006). We found that a source
can be detected at a given location if the ﬂux measured is larger
than a detection limit of 5 − 10 σ of the local noise level and
adopted the conservative and common value of 10σ. The limits
derived have been corrected for the coronagraphic attenuation
of 6.1mag inferred above. For each exposure, the right panel of
Fig. 2 shows the average value of pixels at same angular distance.
When it comes to the determination of the mass of a com-
panion that is still detectable, uncertain age is the largest con-
tribution to the error budget. Using the stellar Ks band magni-
tude and the measured dynamic range, we calculated the Ks band
magnitude of faint objects which could still have been detected
at a given separation. The magnitudes have been interpolated
in evolutionary models to obtain a mass estimate. We used the
COND03 models (Baraﬀe et al. 2003) for eﬀective temperatures
lower than 1,300 K8 and DUSTY00 (Chabrier et al. 2000) mod-
els for temperatures higher than 1,300 K. For ages of 100 Myr,
500 Myr, and 1 Gyr, this temperature corresponds to a mass of
10, 31, and 42 MJup, respectively, and is accessible to the present
survey. In this range of mass, the diﬀerence in K band magnitude
between 100 Myr and 1 Gyr varies from 4 at the high-mass end
to 8 at the low-mass end. Even if we avoid interpolating the true
age range of the UMa group in the evolutionary models, we can
assess that the age uncertainty of the UMa group implies an error
of several K band magnitudes which is the dominant source of
error in the present study.

Fig. 3. Left: Ks magnitude distribution of candidates. Based on Ta-
ble D.2. Errors in magnitude have not been considered. Right: resid-
ual motion of candidates. For all candidates detected in two epochs, the
ﬁgure shows the residual shifts in right ascension and declination over
the time elapsed between the epochs (Table D.2) after correcting for the
proper and parallactic motion of the central stars (Table E.2). The sym-
bols discern the candidates according to their central stars. Error bars
have been omitted for clarity.

(&17 mag for a 10 σ detection). Typically, the dynamic range
for a 10 σ detection limit ranges between ∆Ks = 13 and 15 at
a separation beyond 3" (Figs. 1, E.1, E.2, and E.3). Given the
K band magnitude of the central star, this corresponds to about
12−20 MJup provided an age of 500 Myr (Figs. E.4 and E.5). Ob-
jects with 12 MJup and younger than 1 Gyr could have been de-
tected at separations of less than 10 au in the case of HIP 57548
with the deepest exposure of the present work, and objects with
20 MJup closer than 3 au (Table E.1).

More than 200 candidates have been identiﬁed (Figs. C.1-
C.5, Table D.2). While in some ﬁelds, not a single object has
been detected around the star (HD 11171, HD 26923, HD 38393,
HD 63433, HIP 57548, HD 95650, HD 125451, HD 139006, and
HD 217813), some 160 have been found around HD 165185
which is located in the galactic plane. A number of additional
candidates have been found close to HD 11131, HD 22049,
HD 26913, HD 41593, HD 60491, HD 61606 A, HD 135599,
HD 147584, HD 175742, and HIP 104383 A9.

The relative shift of a companion w.r.t. the star has been mea-
sured when a second epoch was available (Table D.2). All those
cases are non-moving background stars when comparing to the
predicted shift due to the stellar parallactic and proper motion
(Table E.2 and Fig. 3)10. The deviation from these expectations
is less than 0.′′1 in all cases and of the order of the astrometric
error bars (Table D.2). This shows that the true astrometric un-
certainties agree with the assessments by Chauvin et al. (2010)
implemented here (Sect. 3).

The detection limits can be compared to the brightness of
faint background objects detected in the ﬁeld of view. The uncer-
tainties of the photometric measurements are below 1 mag in al-
most all cases. Usually, they are close to 0.5 mag and increasing
towards the detection limit while the photometric measurements
deviate by less than a magnitude from epoch to epoch. Enhanced
error bars can be ascribed to smearing, noise, ﬂux missed by the

5. Results and Discussion

The noise level is observed to decrease strongly with increas-
ing separation from the primary star (Fig. 2). The longest on-
target exposure time was spent on the brightest target, HD 22049,
resulting in the highest dynamic range of the present work

8 According to Baraﬀe et al. (2003), the COND03 models are more ap-
propriate below 1300 K to predict infrared colours, for methane dwarfs
and extrasolar giant planets at large orbital separation. The diﬀerence
between the Ks and the K band has been neglected in the present study.

9 HIP 104383 A is a special case since it appears as a visual binary
below the coronagraph (Fig. D.1). According to Balega et al. (2004),
it is a binary with a separation of 0.′′3 and a magnitude diﬀerence of
1.67 in the R′ band. In the Ks band we measured a magnitude diﬀerence
of 0.45. The astrometric measurements presented here have been done
w.r.t. the brighter component while the co-added signal has been used
for photometric measurements.
10 The parallactic motion has been calculated assuming a value of the
obliquity of the ecliptic plane of 23.◦4 and expressing the solar longitude
by L = 279.◦697 + 36, 000.◦770 T with the time T given by Julian cen-
turies since 1900, January 0, 12 h (Kovalevsky 1995). The eccentricity
of Earth’s orbit has been neglected.

Notes. For each target with previous imaging, the candidates recovered
are listed and the corresponding previous astrometric and photometric
measurements are given together with the reference ID assigned in the
previous work. Relative positions in right ascension and declination are
given for Macintosh et al. (2003) (1) and Janson et al. (2013) (4) while
total separation and position angle are given for Itoh et al. (2008b) (2)
and Metchev & Hillenbrand (2009) (3).

aperture photometry at the edges of the frame, or background
features like diﬀraction spikes, ghosts, and reﬂections (indicated
in Table D.2).

The faintest object identiﬁed (HD 165185, ID0101) advo-
cates an empirical detection limit of Ks≈22 for HD 165185.
However, the aperture photometry of this object is aﬀected by
insuﬃcient background correction so that it must be somewhat
brighter (Fig. C.3). Moreover, the lower envelope to the distribu-
tion of most candidates (Fig. E.2) is a bit higher as is also indi-
cated by the brightness distribution of all candidates (cf. Fig. 3).
It covers magnitudes in the range Ks = 13 − 23 with a sin-
gle brighter object next to HD 11131. As can be expected for
a distribution of ﬁeld stars, there are a few bright objects and a
larger number of faint objects. The number of objects decreases
rapidly at a brightness level fainter than Ks = 20 indicating that
the census is complete down to this value. Since the distribution
is almost entirely constituted of objects next to HD 165185, this
completeness limit is certainly valid for this subset.

We compared our candidates with previous work for tar-
gets in common with other surveys which have not necessar-
ily been dedicated to the UMa group (Macintosh et al. 2003;
Itoh et al. 2008b; Metchev & Hillenbrand 2009).We recovered
all of the previously known candidates (Table 1) at the posi-
tions expected as far as they are covered by our ﬁeld of view.
Photometric measurements agree well within the error bars as
long as they have been measured in the same or a similar pho-
tometric band. The single exception is ID 4 next to HD 175742
(Metchev & Hillenbrand 2009, object 1). Most certainly, the dif-
ference of one Ks magnitude can be explained by the location of
ID 4 in the PSF of HD 175742 where the photometric measure-
ment is very sensitive to imperfections of the PSF subtraction.
The same object was found by Janson et al. (2013) but no pho-
tometric measurement is given there. The southern component
of HD 165185 listed by Mason et al. (2014) is out of the ﬁeld of
view of the present work but displayed in Table B.1.

The deepest exposure has been chosen for each target to de-
rive a survey upper limit on the frequency of stars with a com-
panion of given mass and age. This has been done in a basic way
similar to Lafrenière et al. (2007) without assuming any prior
knowledge on the mass-period distribution of companions.

Fig. 4. Mean survey detection probability for companions of 12, 20,
and 35 MJup as a function of separation and for diﬀerent age of 100 Myr,
500 Myr, and 1 Gyr as indicated in the legend. The solid line gives the
limiting case of a detection probability of 1 in each frame.

For this purpose, maps of 10 σ detection probability have
been derived from the maps of limiting magnitude presented
in Sect. 4 by comparing them to the signal of a 12, 20, and
35 MJup companion at diﬀerent ages of 100 Myr, 500 Myr, and
1 Gyr (using the evolutionary models described in Sect. 4)11. The
mean survey detection probability has been assessed by center-
ing, rescaling, and averaging those probability maps (Fig. 4).
In the limiting case, where the detection probability equals 1
throughout each frame, the average detection probability is only
limited by the respective ﬁeld of view and approaches zero at
separations beyond ∼500 au which are not covered by any ex-
posure of the survey. The age range considered has a stronger
eﬀect than the mass range. On average, the survey is most sensi-
tive at separations between 100 and 200 au since the distance of
the targets and thus the ﬁeld of view covered is very diﬀerent.

We derived the upper limit on the frequency of stars
with a companion where the mean 10 σ detection probabil-
ity is high. We followed the Bayesian approach described by
Lafrenière et al. (2007) using the Poisson approximation and a
conﬁdence level of 95 %. In the most sensitive range between
100 and 200 au, we can place an upper limit of ∼25 % on the
frequency of UMa group members with low-mass companions
more massive than 35 MJup if the age of the UMa group is close
to 500 Myr or younger. The limit is never below 15 %, deﬁned
by the number of stars, the conﬁdence level, and the case of a
detection probability of one everywhere (solid line in Fig. 4).

When interpreting the outcome of the present study one has
to be aware of speciﬁc formation environments represented by
the signiﬁcant fraction of targets with stellar companions (cf.
Tables A.2 and B.1). In addition we note that the known com-
panions of GJ 569 have not been considered for the frequency
estimate since they are closer to the star than the ﬁeld covered
by the present work and we did not account for the companions
of HD 130948 since they have masses close to the Deuterium
burning limit of 12 − 13 MJup which we are not sensitive to on
average. Although the results are not at variance with previous
work, it is obvious that the study of the UMa group would beneﬁt
from a larger sample size. So far, northern UMa group members
have not been studied systematically. Those actually comprise
the largest part of the UMa group. Although its densest part on
the northern hemisphere is within 30 pc, the group extends far
beyond.

11 The probability has been computed that a signal exceeds the 10 σ
detection threshold in the presence of noise, assuming a normal distri-
bution.

in the image. North is at the top and East is to the left. The PSF of the central star has been removed in a rectangular area centred on the star and a
smoothed image has been subtracted. The residual speckle pattern and the diﬀraction spikes of the mount of the secondary mirror remain visible
(several of those due to the addition of several exposures). In addition, there are reﬂections, ghosts, a vignetted region to the lower left, and the
shadows of the other three coronagraphs.

Notes. UMa membership information, proper motion (van Leeuwen 2007), and number of epochs of NACO observations obtained for the present
work. We reiterate the assignments by Montes et al. (2001) and King et al. (2003) concerning the match of Eggen’s criteria or, respectively, the
decision on kinematic, photometric, and ﬁnal membership (’Y’ = yes; ’N’ = no). Uncertainty is expressed by ’?’ and we refer the reader to
King et al. (2003) for more information. Some of the stars were not observed (zero NACO epochs taken) as is explained in the text and omitted
here.

Notes. All parallaxes are HIPPARCOS parallaxes (van Leeuwen 2007). Ks band magnitudes were taken from 2MASS (Skrutskie et al. 2006) and
are combined magnitudes for tight binaries. For spectroscopic binaries, the spectral type is displayed for both components.

Notes. (2, 3) Range of separations which are completely covered around the coronograph (from inner radius, i.e. outer bound of the coronagraph
of 0.′′35 to the outer radius of 9′′ shown in Fig. 1). – (4) maximum (incomplete) ﬁeld of view (25′′) – (5-8) separation of up to two known
nearby visual companions, reference, and WDS catalogue entry. – (9, 10) Mass of the central star/binary and reference – (11) Separation of
the approximate widest expected bound orbit of very low-mass companions according to the approximation by Close et al. (2003) for masses
greater than 0.185 M⊙. Very close (spectroscopic) components are not listed but accounted for in the central mass. Masses have been derived
separately for the binary components of HIP 104383 (0.6 M⊙ and 0.5 M⊙, respectively) and then added up. HD 147584 is a spectroscopic binary
with components of 1.12 M⊙ and 0.09 − 0.45 M⊙ (Skuljan et al. 2004, an average of 0.27 M⊙ has been adopted for the secondary). HD 175742 is a
single-lined spectroscopic binary with a primary mass of 0.75 M⊙ and a minimum mass of the secondary of 0.35 M⊙ (Tokovinin et al. 2006). The
maximum expected orbital separation is thus a lower limit in this particular case.

Notes. A list of unique sequential identiﬁers (preﬁx ’ID’) has been assigned to the candidates (1) (cf. Figs. C.1-C.5). For each candidate, the
separation from the central star in right ascension and declination is given for the ﬁrst epoch (2, 3) and the second epoch when present (4, 5).
Finally, apparent Ks magnitude is given for all candidates (6) and - when two epochs are available - the change of separation (7,8). The change
in separation reﬂects the stellar parallactic and proper motion since all candidates are background stars (see text and Table E.2). Large error bars
in the magnitude measurement are ascribed to diﬀerent causes. Those are indicated by letters to the column for error bars ≥ 0.8: (a) aﬀected by
background features (like diﬀraction spikes, ghosts, reﬂections) (b) smeared in ﬁrst epoch (c) aperture photometry misses ﬂux at edge of frame
(d) measurement aﬀected by noise in ﬁrst epoch.

Fig. D.1. The visual binary HIP 104383 A below the semi-transparent coronagraphic mask. The binary has already been characterised (Balega et al.
2004). The full frame exposing companion candidates is shown in Fig. C.4. The magnitudes of the binary components diﬀer by 0.45 mag in the Ks
band.

Fig. E.1. Dynamic range curves are shown for stars with candidates and observations in two epochs: HD 22049, HD 26913, HD 41593, HD
60491, HD 61606, and HD 135599. The lines show the 10 σ detection limits for the 1st and 2nd epoch as is indicated in the legend. The adoption
of a 5 σ limit to describe the visual detection of candidates would lower the curves by 2.5 log2 = 0.75 mag. Furthermore, the curves can vary by
0.3 mag due to the uncertainty of the transmission of the coronagraph. Filled circles indicate candidates found in the 1st epoch, open circles those
in the 2nd epoch, and ﬁlled squares those seen in both epochs.

Notes. (1) Name of the target star. – (2) Epoch of exposure (average if several visits have been co-added, see below). – (3) On-target exposure
time (total exposure time on target if several visits have been co-added). – (4-12) lower limit on the separation of detectable objects for masses
of 12, 20, and 35 MJup and ages of 100 Myr, 500 Myr, and 1 Gyr, respectively. The relation of masses and magnitudes has been interpolated in the
DUSTY00 and COND03 grids. Several targets have been observed repeatedly: (a) 2, 3, and 5 Sep 2004 (b) 4 and 22 Nov 2003 and 4 Jan 2004 (c) 22
Nov 2003 and 11 Jan 2004 (d) 22 Nov 2003, 10 and 15 Jan 2004 (e) 4 and 22 Jul 2004 (f) 4 Jul and 9 Sep 2004 (g) 6 and 7 Oct 2003.
