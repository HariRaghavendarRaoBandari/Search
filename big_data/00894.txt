EXTREMAL RESULTS FOR RANDOM DISCRETE STRUCTURES

MATHIAS SCHACHT

Abstract. We study thresholds for extremal properties of random discrete structures.

We determine the threshold for Szemerédi’s theorem on arithmetic progressions in random

subsets of the integers and its multidimensional extensions and we determine the threshold

for Turán-type problems for random graphs and hypergraphs. In particular, we verify a

conjecture of Kohayakawa, Łuczak, and Rödl for Turán-type problems in random graphs.

Similar results were obtained by Conlon and Gowers.

§1. Introduction

Extremal problems are widely studied in discrete mathematics. Given a ﬁnite set Γ and

a family F of subsets of Γ an extremal result asserts that any suﬃciently large (or dense)

subset G Ď Γ must contain an element from F . Often all elements of F have the same

size, i.e., F Ď`Γ

of Γ.

k˘ for some integer k, where`Γ

k˘ denotes the family of all k-element subsets

For example, if Γn “ rns “ t1, . . . , nu and Fn consists of all k-element subsets of rns
which form an arithmetic progression, then Szemerédi’s celebrated theorem [40] asserts

that every subset Y Ď rns with |Y | “ Ωpnq contains an arithmetic progression of length k.

A well known result from graph theory, which ﬁts this framework, is Turán’s theorem [41]
and its generalization due to Erdős and Stone [12] (see also [10]). Here Γn “ EpKnq is the
edge set of the complete graph with n vertices and Fn consists of the edge sets of copies
of some ﬁxed graph F (say with k edges) in Kn. Here the Erdős-Stone theorem implies
that every subgraph H Ď Kn which contains at least

edges must contain a copy of F , where χpF q denotes the chromatic number of F (see,

e.g., [2, 3, 5, 7]). The connection with the chromatic number was explicitly stated in the

work of Erdős and Simonovits [10].

We are interested in “random versions” of such extremal results. We study the binomial
model of random substructures. For a ﬁnite set Γn and a probability p P r0, 1s we denote
by Γn,p the random subset where every x P Γn is included in Γn,p independently with
probability p. In other words, Γn,p is the ﬁnite probability space on the power set of Γn
in which every elementary event tGu for G Ď Γn occurs with probability

P pG “ Γn,pq “ p|G|p1 ´ pq|Γn|´|G| .

For example, if Γn is the edge set of the complete graph on n vertices, then Γn,p denotes
the usual binomial random graph Gpn, pq (see, e.g., [4, 25]).

The deterministic extremal results mentioned earlier can be viewed as statements which

hold with probability 1 for p “ 1 and it is natural to investigate the asymptotic of the

smallest probabilities for which those results hold. In the context of Szemerédi’s theorem
for every k ě 3 and ε ą 0 we are interested in the smallest sequence p “ ppnqnPN of
probabilities such that the binomial random subset rnspn has asymptotically almost surely
(a.a.s., i.e. with probability tending to 1 as n Ñ 8) the following property: Every subset
Y Ď rnspn with |Y | ě ε|rnspn| contains an arithmetic progression of length k. Similarly, in
the context of the Erdős-Stone theorem, for every graph F and ε ą 0 we are interested in
the asymptotic of the smallest sequence p “ ppnqnPN such that the random graph Gpn, pnq
a.a.s. satisﬁes: every H Ď Gpn, pq with

epHq ěˆ1 ´

χpF q ´ 1

` ε˙ epGpn, pnqq ,

contains a copy of F .

We determine the asymptotic growth of the smallest such sequence p of probabilities

for those and some related extremal properties including multidimensional versions of

Szemerédi’s theorem (Theorem 2.3), solutions of density regular systems of equations

(Theorem 2.4), an extremal version for solutions of the Schur equation (Theorem 2.5),

and extremal problems for hypergraphs (Theorem 2.7). In other words, we determine the

threshold for those properties. Similar results were obtained by Conlon and Gowers [6].

The new results will follow from a general result (see Theorem 3.3), which allows us to

transfer certain extremal results from the classical deterministic setting to the probabilistic

setting. In Section 4 we deduce the results stated in the next section from Theorem 3.3.

§2. New results

2.1. Szemerédi’s theorem and its multidimensional extension. We study extremal

properties of random subsets of the ﬁrst n positive integers. One of the best known

extremal-type results for the integers is Szemerédi’s theorem. In 1975 Szemerédi solved

EXTREMAL RESULTS FOR RANDOM DISCRETE STRUCTURES

a longstanding conjecture of Erdős and Turán [13] by showing that every subset of the

integers of upper positive density contains an arithmetic progression of any ﬁnite length.

For a set X Ď rns we write

X Ñε rks

(1)

for the statement that every subsets Y Ď X with |Y | ě ε|X| contains an arithmetic

progression of length k. With this notation at hand, we can state (the ﬁnite version of)
Szemerédi’s theorem as follows: for every integer k ě 3 and ε ą 0 there exists n0 such
that for every n ě n0 we have rns Ñε rks.

For ﬁxed k ě 3 and ε ą 0 we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of the threshold

sequence of probabilities p “ ppnq such that there exist constants 0 ă c ă C for which

lim

%

0,

if qn ď cpn for all n P N,

if qn ě Cpn for all n P N.

(2)

Remark 2.1. We note that the family tX Ď rns : X Ñε rksu is not closed under supersets.
In other words, the property is “X Ñε rks” is not a monotone property. However, similar
arguments as presented in [25, Proposition 8.6] show that the property “X Ñε rks” and
the other properties considered in this section have a threshold as displayed in (2).

It is easy to see that if the expected number of arithmetic progressions of length k
in rnsqn is asymptotically smaller than the expected number of elements in rnsqn, then
there exists a subset of size p1 ´ op1qq|rnsqn|, which contains no arithmetic progressions of
length k at all. In other word, if

nn2 ! qnn
qk

ðñ

qn ! n´1{pk´1q

(3)

then P prnsqn Ñε rksq Ñ 0 for every ε ă 1. Consequently, n´1{pk´1q is a lower bound on
the threshold for Szemerédi’s theorem for arithmetic progressions of length k. For k “ 3

Kohayakawa, Łuczak, and Rödl [28] established a matching upper bound. Our ﬁrst result

generalizes this for arbitrary k ě 3.

Theorem 2.2. For every integer k ě 3 and every ε P p0, 1q there exist constants C ą c ą 0
such that for any sequence of probabilities q “ pqnqnPN we have

if qn ď cn´1{pk´1q for all n P N,

if qn ě Cn´1{pk´1q for all n P N.

We remark that the 0-statement in Theorem 2.2 (and, similarly, the 0-statements of

the other results of this section) follows from standard probabilistic arguments. The 1-

statement of Theorem 2.2 follows from our main result, Theorem 3.3.

MATHIAS SCHACHT

A multidimensional version of Szeméredi’s theorem was obtained by Furstenberg and
Katznelson [18]. Those authors showed that for every integer ℓ, every ﬁnite subset F Ă Nℓ
and every ε ą 0 there exists some integer n0 such that for n ě n0 every Y Ď rnsℓ with
|Y | ě εnℓ contains a homothetic copy of F , i.e., there exist some y0 P Nℓ and λ ą 0 such
that y0 ` λF “ ty0 ` λf : f P F u Ď Y . Clearly, the case ℓ “ 1 and F “ rks resembles
Szemerédi’s theorem. Generalizing the notation introduced in (1), for sets X, F Ď Nℓ and
for ε ą 0 we write X Ñε F , if every subset Y Ď X with |Y | ě ε|X| contains a homothetic
copy of F .

A simple heuristic, similar to the one in the context of Szeméredi’s theorem, suggests
that n´1{p|F |´1q is a lower bound on the threshold for the Furstenberg-Katznelson theorem
p where elements of rnsℓ are
for a conﬁguration F Ď Nℓ in the binomial random subset rnsℓ
included with probability p. Our next result shows that, in fact, this gives the correct

asymptotic for the threshold.

Theorem 2.3. For every integer ℓ ě 1, every ﬁnite set F Ď Nℓ with |F | ě 3, and
every constant ε P p0, 1q there exist C ą c ą 0 such that for any sequence of probabilities
q “ pqnqnPN we have

if qn ď cn´1{p|F |´1q for all n P N,

if qn ě Cn´1{p|F |´1q for all n P N.

2.2. Density regular matrices. Another extension of Szemerédi’s theorem leads to the

notion of density regular matrices. Arithmetic progressions of length k can be viewed as

the set of distinct-valued solutions of the following homogeneous system of k ´ 2 linear

equations

x1 ´ 2x2 ` x3 “ 0 ,
x2 ´ 2x3 ` x4 “ 0 ,
...
...
xk´2 ´ 2xk´1 ` xk “ 0 .

...

...

More generally, for an ℓ ˆ k integer matrix A let SpAq Ď Rk be the set of solutions of the
homogeneous system of linear equations given by A. Let S0pAq Ď SpAq be those solutions
px1, . . . , xkq with all xi being distinct. We say A is irredundant if S0pAq ‰ ∅. Moreover,
an irredundant ℓ ˆ k integer matrix A is density regular, if for every ε ą 0 there exists
an n0 such that for all n ě n0 and every Y Ď rns with |Y | ě εn we have Y k X S0pAq ‰ ∅.

is density regular for any k ě 3.

Density regular matrices are a subclass of so-called partition regular matrices. This

class was studied and characterized by Rado [34] and, for example, it follows from this

characterization that k ě ℓ ` 2 (see [22] for details). In [14] Frankl, Graham, and Rödl

characterized irredundant, density regular matrices, being those partition regular matri-

ces A for which p1, 1, . . . , 1q P SpAq.

Similar as in the context of Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.3 the following notation will

be useful. For an irredundant, density regular, ℓ ˆ k integer matrix A, ε ą 0, and X Ď rns
we write X Ñε A if for every Y Ď X with |Y | ě ε|X| we have Y k X S0pAq ‰ ∅.
The following parameter in connection with Ramsey properties of random subsets of the

integers with respect to irredundant, partition regular matrices was introduced by Rödl

and Ruciński [36].

Let A be an ℓ ˆ k integer matrix and let the columns be indexed by rks. For a parti-
tion W Y¨ W Ď rks of the columns of A, we denote by AW the matrix obtained from A
by restricting to the columns indexed by W . Let rankpAW q be the rank of AW , where
rankpAW q “ 0 for W “ ∅. We set

mpAq “ max

W Y¨ W “rks

|W |ě2

|W | ´ 1

|W | ´ 1 ` rankpAW q ´ rankpAq

.

(5)

It was shown in [36, Proposition 2.2 (ii )] that for irredundant, partition regular matrices A

the denominator of (5) is always at least 1. For example, for A given in (4) we have

mpAq “ k ´ 1.

It follows from the 0-statement of Theorem 1.1 in [36] that for any irredundant, density

regular, ℓ ˆ k integer matrix A of rank ℓ and every 1{2 ą ε ą 0 there exist a c ą 0 such
that for every sequence of probabilities q “ pqnq with qn ď cn´1{mpAq we have

lim
nÑ8

P prnsqn Ñε Aq “ 0 .

(6)

We shall deduce a corresponding upper bound from Theorem 3.3 and obtain the following

result.

Theorem 2.4. For every irredundant, density regular, ℓ ˆ k integer matrix A with rank ℓ,

and every ε P p0, 1{2q there exist constants C ą c ą 0 such that for any sequence of
probabilities q “ pqnqnPN we have

P prnsqn Ñε Aq “$&
%

0,

1,

if qn ď cn´1{mpAq for all n P N,

if qn ě Cn´1{mpAq for all n P N.

Note that we restrict ε ă 1{2 here. With this restriction the 0-statement will follow

from a result of Rödl and Ruciński from [36]. The proof of the 1-statement presented in

Section 4.2 actually works for all ε P p0, 1q.

2.3. An extremal problem related to Schur’s equation. In 1916 Schur [38] showed

that every partition of the positive integers into ﬁnitely many classes contains a class which
contains a solution of the single, homogeneous equation x1 ` x2 ´ x3 “ 0. Clearly, the

corresponding matrix ´1 1 ´1¯ is not density regular, since the set of all odd integers

contains no solution. However, it is not hard to show that every subset Y Ď rns with

|Y | ě p1{2 ` op1qqn contains such a solution. Similarly, as above for ε ą 0 and X Ď rns

we write

if every subset Y Ď X with |Y | ě p1{2 ` εq|X| contains a distinct-valued solution, i.e.,

X Ñ1{2`ε ´1 1 ´1¯
Y 3 X S0´´1 1 ´1¯¯ ‰ ∅ .

We are interested in the threshold for the extremal problem of Schur’s equation, i.e.,

for the property X Ñ1{2`ε ´1 1 ´1¯.

the expected number of solutions of the Schur equation in random subsets of the integers
suggests that n´1{2 is the threshold for this property. Moreover, for Schur’s theorem in
random subsets of the integers the threshold turned out to be n´1{2 as shown in [16, 21].
We show that the threshold of the extremal version of Schur’s equation is the same.

In this context the simple heuristic based on

Theorem 2.5. For every ε P p0, 1{2q there exist constants C ą c ą 0 such that for any
sequence of probabilities q “ pqnqnPN we have

2.4. Extremal problems for hypergraphs. The last result we present here deals with

extremal problems for hypergraphs. An ℓ-uniform hypergraph H is a pair pV, Eq, where

the vertex set V is some ﬁnite set and the edge set E Ď `V

element subsets of V . As usual we call 2-uniform hypergraphs simply graphs. For some

ℓ˘ is a subfamily of the ℓ-

EXTREMAL RESULTS FOR RANDOM DISCRETE STRUCTURES

hypergraph H we denote by V pHq and EpHq its vertex set and its edge set and we denote
by vpHq and epHq the cardinalities of those sets. For an integer n we denote by K pℓq
n the
complete ℓ-uniform hypergraph on n vertices, i.e., vpK pℓq
ℓ-uniform hypergraph H 1 is a sub-hypergraph of H, if V pH 1q Ď V pHq and EpH 1q Ď EpHq
and we write H 1 Ď H to denote that. For a subset U Ď V pHq we denote by EpUq the
edges of H contained in U and we set epUq “ |EpUq|. Moreover, we write HrUs for the

n q “ `n

n q “ n and epK pℓq

ℓ˘. An

sub-hypergraph induced on U, i.e., HrUs “ pU, EpUqq.

For two ℓ-uniform hypergraphs F and H we say H contains a copy of F , if there exists

an injective map ϕ : V pF q Ñ V pHq such that ϕpeq P EpHq for every e P EpF q. If H

contains no copy of F , then we say H is F -free. We denote by expH, F q the maximum

number of edges of an F -free sub-hypergraph of H, i.e.,

expH, F q “ maxtepH 1q : H 1 Ď H and H 1 is F -freeu .

Mantel [33], Erdős [8], and Turán [41] were the ﬁrst to study this function for graphs.
In particular, Turán determined expKn, Kkq for all integers n and k. This line of research
was continued by Erdős and Stone [12] and Erdős and Simonovits [10] and those authors

showed that for every graph F with chromatic number χpF q ě 3 we have

expKn, F q “ˆ1 ´

(7)

where χpF q is minimum number r such that there exists a partition V1 Y¨ . . . Y¨ Vr “ V pF q
such that EpViq “ ∅ for every i P rrs. Moreover, it follows from the result of Kövari, Sós,
and Turán [31] (see also [12]) that

expKn, F q “ opn2q

For an ℓ-uniform hypergraph F we deﬁne the Turán density

For a graph F the Turán density πpF q is determined due to (7) and (8). For hyper-

graphs (8) was extended by Erdős [9] to ℓ-partite, ℓ-uniform hypergraphs. Here an ℓ-

uniform hypergraph F is ℓ-partite if its vertex set can be partitioned into ℓ classes, such

that every edge intersects every partition class in precisely one vertex. Erdős showed that

πpF q “ 0 for every ℓ-partite, ℓ-uniform hypergraph F . For other ℓ-uniform hypergraphs
only a few results are known and, for example, determining πpK p3q
4 q is one of the best
known open problems in the area. However, one can show that πpF q indeed exists for

every hypergraph F (see, e.g. [26]).

We study the random variable expGpℓqpn, qq, F q for ﬁxed ℓ-uniform hypergraphs F ,
n with edges

where Gpℓqpn, qq denotes the binomial random ℓ-uniform sub-hypergraph of K pℓq
of K pℓq

n included independently with probability q. It is easy to show that

expH, F q ě πpF qepHq

for all ℓ-uniform hypergraphs H and F (see, e.g. [25, Proposition 8.4] for a proof for

graphs). We are interested in the threshold for the property that a.a.s.

expGpℓqpn, qq, F q ď pπpF q ` op1qqepGpℓqpn, qqq .

(9)

Results of that sort appeared in the work of Babai, Simonovits, and Spencer [1] who

showed that (9) holds random graphs when F is a clique and q “ 1{2. Moreover, it
follows from an earlier result of Frankl and Rödl [15] that the same holds for F “ K3 as
long as q " n´1{2. The systematic study for graphs was initiated by Kohayakawa and his
coauthors. In particular, Kohayakawa, Łuczak, and Rödl formulated a conjecture for the

threshold of Turán properties for random graphs (see Conjecture 2.6 below).

For an ℓ-uniform hypergraph F with epF q ě 1 we set

if vpF 1q “ ℓ .

(10)

It follows from the deﬁnition of mpF q, that if q “ Ωpn´1{mpF qq then a.a.s. the number of
copies of every sub-hypergraph F 1 Ď F in the random hypergraph Gpℓqpn, qq has at least
the same order of magnitude, as the number of edges of Gpℓqpn, qq. Recall that a similar
heuristic gave rise to the thresholds in the theorem above.

Conjecture 2.6 ([29, Conjecture 1 (i )]). For every graph F with at least one edge and
every ε ą 0 there exists C ą 0 such that for every sequence of probabilities q “ pqnqnPN
with qn ě Cn´1{mpF q we have

lim
nÑ8

P pexpGpn, qnq, F q ď pπpF q ` εqepGpn, qnqqq “ 1 .

Conjecture 2.6 was veriﬁed for a few special cases. As already mentioned for F “ K3
the conjecture follow from a result in [15]. For F being a clique with 4, 5, or 6 vertices the

conjecture was veriﬁed by Kohayakawa, Łuczak, and Rödl [29], Gerke, Schickinger, and

Steger [20] and Gerke [19]. Moreover, the conjecture is known to be true when F is a cycle

due to the work of Füredi [17] (for the cycle of length four) and Haxell, Kohayakawa, and

Łuczak [23, 24] (see also [27, 32]) and the conjecture is known to be true for trees. The

best current bounds on q for which (9) holds for F being a clique and for arbitrary F were

obtained by Szabó and Vu [39] and Kohayakawa, Rödl, and Schacht [30].

EXTREMAL RESULTS FOR RANDOM DISCRETE STRUCTURES

We verify this conjecture for all graphs F and the natural analogue of this conjecture

for hypergraphs. (For ℓ-partite, ℓ-uniform hypergraphs such a conjecture was made in [37,

Conjecture 15].)

Theorem 2.7. For every ℓ-uniform hypergraph F with at least one vertex contained in at

least two edges and every ε P p0, 1 ´ πpF qq there exist constants C ą c ą 0 such that for

In Section 4 we will deduce the 1-statements of Theorems 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.7 from

the main result, Theorem 3.3, which we present in the next section. The proofs of the

0-statements will be more elementary and will be also given in Section 4.

§3. Main technical result

The main result will be phrased in the language of hypergraphs. We will study sequences
of hypergraphs H “ pHn “ pVn, EnqqnPN. In the context of Theorem 2.2 one may think
of Vn “ rns and En being the arithmetic progressions of length k.
In the context of
Theorems 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 the corresponding hypergraphs the reader should have in mind
are deﬁned in a very similar way. For Theorem 2.7 one should think of Vn “ EpK pℓq
n q being
the edge set of the complete hypergraph K pℓq
n and edges of En correspond to copies of F
in K pℓq
n .

In order to transfer an extremal result from the classical, deterministic setting to the

probabilistic setting we will require that a stronger quantitative version of the extremal

result holds (see Deﬁnition 3.1 below). Roughly speaking, we will require that a suﬃciently

dense sub-structure not only contains one copy of the special conﬁguration (not only

one arithmetic progression or not only one copy of F ), but instead the number of those

conﬁgurations should be of the same order as the total number of those conﬁgurations in

the given underlying ground set.

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let H “ pHnqnPN be a sequence of k-uniform hypergraphs and α ě 0.
We say H is α-dense if the following is true.

For every ε ą 0 there exist ζ ą 0 and n0 such that for every n ě n0 and every U Ď V pHnq

with |U| ě pα ` εq|V pHnq| we have

|EpHnrUsq| ě ζ|EpHnq|.

10

MATHIAS SCHACHT

The second condition in Theorem 3.3 imposes a lower bound on the smallest probabil-

ity for which we can transfer the extremal result to the probabilistic setting (see Deﬁni-

tion 3.2). For a k-uniform hypergraph H “ pV, Eq, i P rk ´ 1s, v P V , and U Ď V we
denote by degipv, Uq the number of edges of H containing v and having at least i vertices
in U r tvu. More precisely,

degipv, Uq “ |te P E : |e X pU r tvuq| ě i and v P eu| .

(11)

For q P p0, 1q we let µipH, qq denote the expected value of the sum over all such degrees
squared with U “ Vq being the binomial random subset of V

µipH, qq “ E«ÿvPV

deg2

i pv, Vqqﬀ .

Deﬁnition 3.2. Let K ě 1, let H “ pHnqnPN be a sequence of k-uniform hypergraphs,
and let p “ ppnqnPN P p0, 1qN be a sequence of probabilities. We say H is pK, pq-bounded
if the following is true.

For every i P rk ´ 1s there exists n0 such that for every n ě n0 and q ě pn we have

µipHn, qq ď Kq2i |EpHnq|2
|V pHnq|

.

(12)

With those deﬁnitions at hand, we can state the main result.

Theorem 3.3. Let H “ pHn “ pVn, EnqqnPN be a sequence of k-uniform hypergraphs, let
p “ ppnqnPN P p0, 1qN be a sequence of probabilities satisfying pk
n|En| Ñ 8 as n Ñ 8, and
let α ě 0 and K ě 1. If H is α-dense and pK, pq-bounded, then the following holds.

For every δ ą 0 and pωnqnPN with ωn Ñ 8 as n Ñ 8 there exists C ě 1 such that for
every 1{ωn ą qn ě Cpn the following holds a.a.s. for Vn,qn. For every subset W Ď Vn,qn
with |W | ě pα ` δq|Vn,qn| we have EpHnrW sq ‰ ∅.

The proof of Theorem 3.3 is based on induction on k and for the induction we will

strengthen the statement (see Lemma 3.4 below).

For a k-uniform hypergraph H “ pV, Eq subsets W Ď U Ď V , and i P t0, 1, . . . , ku we

consider those edges of HrUs which have at least i vertices in W and we denote this family

Theorem 3.5 (Chernoﬀ’s inequality). Let X Ď Y be ﬁnite sets and p P p0, 1s. For every

We also use an approximate concentration result for pK, pq-bounded hypergraphs. The

proof of Lemma 3.4 we need an exponential upper tail bound and, unfortunately, it is

pK, pq-boundedness only bounds the expected value of the quantityřv deg2

known that such bounds usually not exist. However, it was shown by Rödl and Ruciński

in [35] that at the cost of deleting a few elements such bound can be obtained. We will

again apply this idea in the proof of Lemma 3.4.

Proposition 3.6 (Upper tail [35, Lemma 4]). Let H “ pHn “ pVn, EnqqnPN be a sequence
of k-uniform hypergraphs, let p “ ppnqnPN P p0, 1qN be a sequence of probabilities, and let
K ě 1. If H is pK, pq-bounded, then the following holds.

For every i P rk ´ 1s and every η ą 0 there exist b ą 0 and n0 such that for every

3.2. Proof of Lemma 3.4. Let H “ pHn “ pVn, EnqqnPN be a sequence of k-uniform
hypergraphs, let p “ ppnqnPN P p0, 1qN be a sequence of probabilities, and let α ě 0 and
K ě 1 such that H is α-dense and pK, pq-bounded. We prove Lemma 3.4 by induction

on i.

Induction start (i “ 1). For δ ą 0 and pωnqnPN (which plays no role for the induction
start) we appeal to the α-denseness of H and let ζ and n1 be the constants given by this
property for ε “ δ{8. We set

Let β, γ P p0, 1s satisfy βγ ě α ` δ, let n ě n0 be suﬃciently large, q ě pn, and let U Ď Vn
with |U| ě β|Vn| be given. We consider the set Y Ď U deﬁned by

Y “"u P U :

In other words, Y is the set of vertices in U with low degree in HnrUs. Due to the

It follows from Chernoﬀ’s inequality that with probability at least

This concludes the proof of the induction start.

Induction step (i ÝÑ i ` 1). Let i ě 1, δ ą 0, and pωnqnPN with ωn Ñ 8 as n Ñ 8
be given. We will expose the random set Uq in several rounds. The number of “main”
rounds R will depend on the constant ξpi, δ{8q, which is given by the induction assumption.

More precisely, let

ξ1 “ ξpi, δ{8q ,

b1 “ bpi, δ{8q , C 1 “ Cpi, δ{8q ,

and n1 “ n0pi, δ{8q

be given by the induction assumption applied with δ1 “ δ{8. We set

qR Y ¨ ¨ ¨ Y U R

Overview. Roughly, speaking our argument is as follows. We will expose Uq in R
main rounds of the same weight, i.e., we will chose qR in such a way that p1 ´ qq “
p1 ´ qRqR and we let Uq “ U 1
qR. Since, every subset W , which we have
to consider, contains at least γ ě α ` δ proportion of the elements of Uq there must
be at least δR{4 rounds such that |U s
qR X W | ě pα ` δ{2q|UqR|. For those rounds we
will appeal to the induction assumption, which combined with Proposition 3.6, implies
that U contains at least Ωppξ1q2|Vn|q elements u P U with the property that every such u
completes “many” elements in Ei
qRq. Moreover,
in each of these “substantial” rounds pξ1q2|Vn|{p4k`1k2Kq new “rich” elements u will be
created. Consequently, after at most δR{4 ´ 1 of these substantial rounds all but, say,
at most pα ` δ{8q|Vn| ă γ|Vn| elements of U are rich and in the ﬁnal substantial round
W X UqR must contain many rich u P Uand therefore create many elements from Ei`1
U pW q.
However, the error probabilities in the later rounds will have to beat the number of

qRq to elements in Ei`1

U pW X U s

U pW X U s

choices for the elements of W in the earlier rounds. For that we will split the earlier main

rounds into several subrounds. This does not aﬀect the argument indicated above, since
our bound on the number of “rich” elements will be independent of qR. We now continue
with the details of this proof.

Details of the induction step. As discussed above we generate the random set Uq in
several rounds. We will have R main rounds and for that we choose qR such that

1 ´ q “ p1 ´ qRqR .

For s P rRs we will further split the sth main round into BR´s subrounds. For s P rRs we
set

Proof of Claim 2. Let s P S, W ps ´ 1q Ď Ups ´ 1q be given. Note that this also deﬁnes

§4. Proof of the new results

In this section we prove Theorems 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.7. While the involved 0-

statements will follow from standard probabilistic arguments, the 1-statement of those

results will follow from Theorem 3.3.

4.1. Proof of Theorems 2.2 and 2.3. Clearly Theorem 2.2 follows from Theorem 2.3

applied with ℓ “ 1 and F “ rks and it suﬃces to verify Theorem 2.3.

The 0-statement of Theorem 2.3. We start with the 0-statement of the theorem. Let
F Ď Nℓ be a ﬁnite subset with |F | ě 3 and ε ą 0 be given and set

c “ˆ1 ´ 2ε

2 ˙1{p|F |´1q

.

We distinguish diﬀerent cases depending on the sequence q “ pqnq.

Case 1 (qn ! n´pℓ`1q{|F |). In this case the expected number of homothetic copies of F
in rnsℓ
qn contains no
homothetic copy of F , which yields the claim in that range.

qn tends to 0. Hence, we infer from Markov’s inequality that a.a.s. rnsℓ

qn is asymptotically smaller than the expected number of elements in rnsℓ

Case 2 (n´ℓ ! qn ! n´1{p|F |´1q). In this range the expected number of homothetic copies
of F in rnsℓ
qn.
Moreover, it follows from Chernoﬀ’s inequality that a.a.s. |rnsℓ
qn| is very close to its ex-
pectation. Consequently, it follows from Markov’s inequality that a.a.s. the number of
homothetic copies of F in rnsℓ
qn|q. Therefore, by removing one element from
every homothetic copy of F in |rnsℓ
qn|,
which contains no homothetic copy of F at all, which yields the 0-statement in this case.

qn is op|rnsℓ

qn| a.a.s. we obtain a subset Y of size |Y | ě ε|rnsℓ

Note that due to |F | ě 3 the ranges considered in Cases 1 and 2 overlap. Similarly, the

range considered in the case below overlaps with the one from Case 2.

Case 3 (n´pℓ`1q{|F | ! qn ď cn´1{p|F |´1q). Again appealing to Chernoﬀ’s inequality applied
to the size of rnsℓ
qn we infer that it suﬃces to show that a.a.s. the number of homothetic
qn is at most p1 ´ 2εqqnnℓ.

(cid:3)

The 1-statement of Theorem 2.3. We now turn to the 1-statement of Theorem 2.3. We
ﬁrst note that if qn “ Ωp1q, then the theorem follows directly from Chernoﬀ’s inequality
combined with the original result of Furstenberg and Katznelson. Hence we can assume
w.l.o.g. qn “ op1q.

Let F Ď Nℓ with k “ |F | ě 3 and ε P p0, 1q. We shall apply Theorem 3.3. For that
we consider the following sequence of k-uniform hypergraphs H “ pHn “ pVn, EnqqnPN.
Let Vn “ rnsℓ and let every homothetic copy of F form an edge in En.
In particular,
|En| “ Θpnℓ`1q. We set pn “ n´1{pk´1q, p “ ppnqnPN and α “ 0. Clearly, for those
deﬁnitions the conclusion of Theorem 3.3 yields the 1-statement of Theorem 2.3. In order

to apply Theorem 3.3 we have to verify the following three conditions

n|En| Ñ 8 as n Ñ 8,

(a ) pk
(b ) H is α-dense, and

(c ) H is pK, pq-bounded for some K ě 1.

By deﬁnition of pn and Hn we have

which yields (a ), as ℓ ě 1 and k ě 3.

pk

n|En| “ Ω`n´k{pk´1qnℓ`1˘ “ Ω`nℓ´1{pk´1q˘ ,

Condition (b ) holds, due to work of Furstenberg and Katznelson [18]. In fact, it follows
from the result in [18], that for every conﬁguration F Ď Nℓ and every ε ą 0 there exist
ζ ą 0 and n0 such that for every n ě n0 every subset U Ď rnsℓ with |U| ě εnℓ contains at
least ζnℓ`1 homothetic copies of F . In other words, H is 0-dense.

Hence, it is only left to verify condition (c ). We have to show that for every i P rk ´ 1s

and q ě pn “ n´1{pk´1q we have

It follows from the deﬁnition of degi in (11) that µipHn, qq is the expected number of
pairs pF1, F2q of homothetic copies of F which share at least one point v and at least i
points diﬀerent from v of each copy are contained in rnsℓ
q. The expected number of such

pairs pF1, F2q which share exactly one point can be bounded by O`q2inℓ`2˘. Since for

every ﬁxed homothetic copy F1 there exist only constantly many (independent of n) other
copies F2, which share two points with F1, the expected number of such pairs pF1, F2q
with |F1 X F2| ě 2 is bounded by

since q ě Cpn ě Cn´1{pk´1q ě Cn´1{i. Consequently, (33) holds, which concludes the
proof of Theorem 2.3.
(cid:3)

O`qinℓ`1˘ “ O`q2inℓ`2˘ ,

4.2. Proof of Theorem 2.4. The proof of the 0-statement follows directly from the

0-statement of Theorem 1.1 in [36]. Those authors showed that for every irredundant,

density regular ℓ ˆ k matrix with rank ℓ there exists a constant c ą 0 such that for
qn ď cn´mpAq a.a.s. rnsqn can be partitioned into two classes such that none of them
contains a distinct-valued solution of the homogeneous system given by A. Clearly, this

implies the 0-statement of Theorems 2.4 for every ε P p0, 1{2q.

The 1-statement of Theorem 2.4. First we note that if qn “ Ωp1q, then the statement
follows directly from Chernoﬀ’s inequality combined with the deﬁnition of irredundant,

density regular matrix.

Let A be an irredundant, density regular ℓˆk integer matrix of rank ℓ and ε ą 0 For the

application of Theorem 3.3 we consider the following sequence of k-uniform hypergraphs
H “ pHn “ pVn, EnqqnPN. Let Vn “ rns and for every distinct-valued solution px1, . . . , xkq
let tx1, . . . , xku be an edge of En. Moreover we set pn “ n´1{mpAq, p “ ppnqnPN and α “ 0.
The 1-statement of Theorem 2.4 then follows from the conclusion of Theorem 3.3 and

we have to verify the same three conditions (a )-(c ) as in the proof of the 1-statement of

Theorem 2.3.

It was shown in [36, Proposition 2.2 (ii )] that mpAq ě k ´ 1 and due to Rado’s char-

acterization of partition regular matrices (which contains the class of all density regular
matrices) we have k ´ ℓ ě 2, which yields |En| “ Ωpn2q. Therefore, we have

and, hence, condition (a ) is satisﬁed.

Moreover, based on the Furstenberg-Katznelson theorem from [18] it was shown by

Frankl, Graham, and Rödl in [14, Theorem 2], that the sequence of hypergraphs H deﬁned

above is 0-dense, i.e., condition (b ) is fulﬁlled.

Set W1 “ ti1, . . . , iwu and W2 “ tj1, . . . , jwu.

For ﬁxed sets W1, W2 Ď rks we are going to describe all p2k ´ wq-tuples X Y Y satis-
fying (ii ) and (35). To this end consider the 2ℓ ˆ p2k ´ wq matrix B, which arises from
two copies A1 and A2 of A with permuted columns. We set A1 “ pAW 1 | AW1q and
A2 “ pAW2 | AW 2q where for every α “ 1, . . . , w the column of AW1 which is indexed by iα
aligns with that column of AW2 which is indexed by jα. Then let

Without loss of generality we may assume that rankpAW 1q ě rankpAW 2q and, therefore,

rankpBq ě rankpAq ` rankpAW 1q .

Clearly, the number of p2k ´ wq-tuples X Y Y satisfying (ii ) and (35) equals the number
of solutions of the homogeneous system given by B, which is Opn2k´w´rankpBqq. Since A
is an irredundant, partition regular matrix, it follows from [36, Proposition 2.2 (i )] that

quently, any matrix B1 obtained from B by removing one of the middle columns (i.e., one
of the w columns of B which consist of a column of AW1 and a column of AW2) satisﬁes

rankpB1q ě rankpAq ` rankpAW 1q “ ℓ ` rankpAW 1q .

Therefore, it follows from (36) that the number of such p2k ´ wq-tuples that also satisfy

4.3. Proof of Theorem 2.5. The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 2.3 and we

only sketch the main ideas.

The 0-statement of Theorem 2.5. We recall that for the statement X Ñ1{2`ε ´1 1 ´1¯

we only consider distinct-valued of the Schur equation and we call such a solutions Schur-

triples. The expected number of Schur-triples contained in rnsqn is bounded by q3
Consequently, the 0-statement follows from Markov’s inequality if qn ! n´2{3.
In the
middle range n´1 ! qn ! n´1{2 it follows, on the one hand, from Chernoﬀ’s inequality
that a.a.s. |rnsqn| ě qnn{2. On the other hand, due to Markov’s inequality a.a.s. the
number of Schur-triples in rnsqn is opqnnq and, hence, the statement holds in this range
of qn. Finally, if n´2{3 ! qn ď cn´1{2 for suﬃciently small c ą 0, then using Chebyshev’s
inequality one obtains the upper bound of

p1 ´ p1{2 ` εqqqnn{2

on the number of Schur-triples in rnsqn, which holds a.a.s. Consequently,
in view of
Chernoﬀ’s inequality, a.a.s. the random set rnsqn contains a subset of size p1{2 ` εq|rnsqn|,
which contains no Schur-triple.
(cid:3)

The 1-statement of Theorem 2.5. Here the we consider a sequence of 3-uniform hyper-
graphs, where Vn “ rns and En corresponds to all Schur-triples in rns and we set pn “ n´1{2
and α “ 1{2. For given ε P p0, 1{2q we want to appeal to Theorem 3.3 and for that we
assume qn “ op1q. Again the 1-statement of Theorem 2.5 follows from Theorem 3.3 and
we have to verify the three conditions (a )-(c ) as in the proof of the 1-statement of Theo-

rem 2.3.

Condition (a ) follows from the deﬁnition of pn and condition (c ) follows from similar

considerations as in the proof of Theorem 2.3 for ℓ “ 1 and k “ 3.

In order to verify condition (b ) we have to show that for every ε ą 0 there exist ζ ą 0
and n0 such that for n ě n0 every subset A Ď rns with |A| ě p1{2 ` εqn contains at
least ζn2 Schur-triples.

So let A Ď rns satisfy |A| ě p1{2 ` εqn and set A1 “ A X t1, . . . , p1 ´ εqnu (ignoring

ﬂoors and ceilings). It follows that for every z P A r A1 there are at least

pairs x ď y with x, y P A such that x ` y “ z. Hence, if |A r A1| ě 3ε2n{2, then A
contains at least 3ε3n2{4 ´ n Schur-triples and the claim follows.

On the other hand, if |A r A1| ă 3ε2n{2, then we have

|A1| ěˆ1

In other words, we obtained a density increment of ε{2 on the interval p1 ´ εqn and the

conclusion follows from iterating the above argument.

This concludes the proof of condition (b ) and, therefore, Theorem 3.3 yields the proof
of the 1-statement of Theorem 2.5 for sequences q satisfying qn “ op1q. The remaining
case, when qn “ Ωp1q then follows by similar arguments as given in [25, Proposition 8.6]
and we omit the details.

(cid:3)

4.4. Proof of Theorem 2.7.

The 0-statement of Theorem 2.7. Let F be an ℓ-uniform hypergraph with at least one

vertex of degree 2 and ε P p0, 1 ´ πpF qq. We set

c “

1 ´ πpF q ´ ε

.

For the proof of the 0-statement we consider diﬀerent ranges of q “ pqnqnPN depending
on the density of the densest sub-hypergraph of F and depending on mpF q. Let F 1 be the
densest sub-hypergraph of F with epF 1q ě 1, i.e., F 1 maximizes epF 1q{vpF 1q. Moreover,
let F 2 be one of those sub-hypergraphs for which

dpF 2q “ mpF q

(see (10) for the deﬁnition of those parameters). Note that epF 2q ě 2, since F contains a
vertex of degree at least two. We consider the following three ranges for q.

Case 1 (qn ! n´vpF 1q{epF 1q). In this range the expected number of copies of F 1 in Gpℓqpn, qnq
tends to 0 and, therefore, the statement follows from Markov’s inequality.

Case 2 (n´ℓ ! qn ! n´1{mpF q). It follows from the deﬁnition of mpF q, that in this range
the expected number of copies of F 2 in Gpℓqpn, qnq is asymptotically smaller than the
expected number of of edges of Gpℓqpn, qnq. Therefore, applying Markov’s inequality to
the number of copies of F 2 and Chernoﬀ’s inequality to the number of edges Gpℓqpn, qnq
we obtain that a.a.s. the number of copies of F 2 satisﬁes opepGpℓqpn, qnqqq. Hence, a.a.s.
we can obtain an F 2-free, and consequently, an F 2-free sub-hypergraph of Gpℓqpn, qnq by
removing only opepGpℓqpn, qnqqq edges, which yields the statement for this range of qn.

28

MATHIAS SCHACHT

We note that n´ℓ ! n´vpF 1q{epF 1q since F contains a vertex of degree 2. In other words,
the interval considered in Case 2 overlaps with the interval from Case 1. Similarly, the

range considered in the case below overlaps with the one from Case 2.

Case 3 (n´vpF 1q{epF 1q ! qn ď cn´1{mpF q). Applying again Chernoﬀ’s inequality to the
random variable epGpℓqpn, qnqq we see that it suﬃces to show that a.a.s. the number of
copies of F 2 is at most p1 ´ pπpF q ` εqqqnnℓ{2.

Let ZF 2 be the random variable denoting the number of copies of F 2 in Gpℓqpn, qnq.

The 1-statement of Theorem 2.7. Let F be an ℓ-uniform hypergraph with at least one

vertex. For an application of Theorem 3.3 we consider the sequence of k-uniform hyper-
graphs H “ pHn “ pVn, EnqqnPN where Vn “ EpK pℓq
n q and edges of En correspond to copies
of F in Kn. Moreover, we set pn “ n´1{mpF q and α “ πpF q. Clearly, for this set up the
conclusion of Theorem 3.3 yields the 1-statement of Theorem 2.7 for sequences q with
qn “ op1q. In order to apply Theorem 3.3 we have to verify the three conditions (a )-(c )
stated in the proof of the 1-statement of Theorem 2.3.

Condition (a ) follows from the deﬁnitions of pn and En combined.

In fact, since F
contains a vertex of degree at least 2 we have mpF q ě 1{pℓ ´ 1q and pn|En| “ Ωpnq. Such
a result was obtained by Erdős and Simonovits [11, Theorem 1] and, hence, it is left to
