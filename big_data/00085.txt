THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE NUMBER OF PARTS OF m-ARY

PARTITIONS MODULO m.

TOM EDGAR

Abstract. We investigate the number of parts modulo m of m-ary partitions of a positive
integer n. We prove that the number of parts is equidistributed modulo m on a special subset
of m-ary partitions. As consequences, we explain when the number of parts is equidistributed
modulo m on the entire set of partitions, and we provide an alternate proof of a recent result
of Andrews, Fraenkel, and Sellers about the number of m-ary partitions modulo m.

1. Preliminaries and Statement of the Main Result

Throughout this note, we let N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} represent the set of natural numbers. For
any m ≥ 2, every natural number n has a unique base-m representation of the form n =
n0 + n1m + · · ·+ nkmk with nk 6= 0. We express this more compactly as n = (n0, n1, . . . , nk)m
and use the convention that ni = 0 if i > k.

For m ≥ 2, we say a partition of n ∈ N is an m-ary partition if each part is a power of
m. We let bm(n) represent the number of m-ary partitions of n. For instance, the 2-ary
partitions of 8 are

8, 4 + 4, 4 + 2 + 2, 4 + 2 + 1 + 1, 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, 2 + 2 + 2 + 2, 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1,

2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1,

so that b2(8) = 10.

In a recent issue of The American Mathematical Monthly, Andrews, Fraenkel, and Sellers
(see [3]) provided the following beautiful characterization of the number of m-ary partitions
mod m relying only on the base-m representation of a number.

Theorem 1.1 (Andrews, Fraenkel, Sellers). If m ≥ 2 and n = (n0, n1, . . . , nk)m then

k

bm(mn) =

(ni + 1)

(mod m).

Their elegant proof follows from clever manipulation of power series and the generating
function for m-ary partitions. Their result allows for a uniform proof of many known con-
gruence properties of m-ary partitions originally conjectured by Churchhouse and proved by
Rødseth, Andrews and Gupta (see [6], [10], [1], [9], and [8]).

Theorem 1.1 implies that

for some q ∈ N. Our primary result (Theorem 1.2) provides a combinatorial interpretation
for the value of q. Furthermore, as a corollary to our main result, we obtain a new proof of
Theorem 1.1 that does not rely on generating functions.

We note that the product in Theorem 1.1, Qk

i=0(ni + 1), arises in various other places;
for instance, when m is prime, this number counts the nonzero entries in row n of Pascal’s
Triangle mod m (see [7]). This product can also be interpreted in terms of a partial order
on the Natural numbers arising from base-m representations. In particular, for ﬁxed m ≥ 2,
we let ≪m represent the digital dominance order deﬁned by a ≪m b if ai ≤ bi for all i, where
a = (a0, a1, . . . , ak)m and b = (b0, b1, . . . , bl)m (see [4] or [5]). Then, for n = (n0, n1, . . . , nk)m,
the product Qk
i=0(ni + 1) counts the number of integers dominated by n (see [4]). We will
use the interpretation of the product in terms of the m-dominance order in what follows.

Now, let n be a positive integer with mk ≤ n < mk+1, then every m-ary partition is of the

form

ℓk · mk + ℓk−1 · mk−1 + · · · ℓ1 · m + ℓ0

with ℓi ≥ 0 for all i. We will denote such a partition by [ℓ0, ℓ1, . . . , ℓk−1, ℓk]m. We mention
here that the base-m representation of n yields an m-ary partition

Finally, We deﬁne a function nops from m-ary partitions of n to N by

(n0, n1, . . . , nk)m 7→ [n0, n1, . . . , nk]m.

nops([ℓ0, ℓ1, . . . , ℓk−1, ℓk]m) =

k

X

i=0

ℓi;

this represents the number of parts of the partition.

Now,

let n = (n0, n1, . . . , nk)m. We call an m-ary partition, ℓ, of n simple if ℓ =
[ℓ0, ℓ1, . . . , ℓk]m with ℓi ≤ ni for all i ≥ 1. Thus, simple partitions are obtained by re-
placing powers of m in the m-ary representation with the appropriate number of 1’s. Let
Pm(n) be the set of m-ary partitions of n, Sm(n) be the set of simple m-ary partitions of n,
and Nm(n) = Pm(n) \ Sm(n) be the set of non-simple m-ary partitions of n. Restricting the
function nops to Nm(n), we get the following result.

Theorem 1.2. Let m ≥ 2 and n ∈ N. Then the nops function is equidistributed modulo m
on the set Nm(n).

As a corollary, we obtain the following.

Corollary 1.3. Let bm(n) be the number of m-ary partitions of n = (n0, n1, . . . , nk)m, then

k

bm(n) ≡

(mod m).

We note that the previous corollary is stated slightly diﬀerently than Theorem 1.1, which is
given only for bm(mn); however, due to the fact that bm(mn + r) = bm(mn) when 0 < r < m
(as stated in [3]), the two forms are equivalent.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the details necessary to prove
In addition, we use
Theorem 1.2. We prove the theorem and its corollary in Section 3.
Theorem 1.2 to describe when nops is equidistributed mod m on the entire set of m-ary
partitions, Pm(n). Section 4 contains a detailed example illustrating the results in Sections
2 and 3. Finally, in Section 5 we describe some possible extensions.

2. Technical details

In this section, we provide a systematic way to partition Nm(n), which will be used to
prove Theorem 1.2. We have included a detailed example of this method of partitioning in
Section 4.

Let m ≥ 2 and n ∈ N be ﬁxed with n = (n0, n1, . . . , nk)m. We ﬁrst deﬁne a function

fm,n : Nm(n) → N by

fm,n([ℓ0, ℓ1, . . . , ℓk]m) = (b0, b1, b2, . . . , bk)m,

where bi = min(ni, ℓi) for all i; we note that b0 = n0 since ℓ0 ≡ n0 (mod m). The following
lemma follows by construction.

Lemma 2.1. For any non-simple partition ℓ ∈ Nm(n), then we have fm,n(ℓ) ≪m n.

Now, we use fm,n to deﬁne a relation on Nm(n) by ρ ∼ γ if fm,n(ρ) = fm,n(γ).

Lemma 2.2. The relation ∼ is an equivalence relation, and so

{f −1

m,n(b) | b ∈ N and b ≪m n and f −1

m,n(b) 6= ∅}

forms a partition of Nm(n).

Proof. Any function yields such an equivalence relation.

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.3. Let ℓ be a non-simple m-ary partition of n. Then ℓ can be component-wise
decomposed as

ℓ = [ℓ0, ℓ1, . . . , ℓk]m = [r0, r1, . . . , rk]m + [b0, b1, b2, . . . , bk]m

where b = (b0, b1, b2, . . . , bk)m = fm,n(ℓ) and ri ≥ 0 for all i. Moreover, it follows that ri > 0
only if ni = bi.

Proof. Since ri = ℓi − min(ℓi, ni), it is clear that ri ≥ 0. Now if ri > 0, then min(ℓi, ni) 6= ℓi
so that bi = ni as required.
(cid:3)

Lemma 2.4. Let ℓ be a non-simple m-ary partition of n = (n0, n1, . . . , nk)m with ℓ ∈ f −1
where b = (b0, b1, ..., bk)m. Suppose that ℓ is of the form

m,n(b)

ℓ = [ℓ0, b1, b2, . . . , bj−1, ℓj, ℓj+1, . . . , ℓk]m

with ℓj > nj = bj. Then, there is a unique pair (r, h) with r ≥ 1 and 0 ≤ h < mj such that
ℓj ≤ nj +mr, there is an m-ary partition of the form [h, b1, b2, . . . , bj−1, bj +mr, ℓj+1, . . . , ℓk]m,
and there is no m-ary partition of the form [h′, b1, b2, . . . , bj−1, g, ℓj+1, . . . , ℓk]m with g >
bj + mr.

Proof. Let s = ℓj − bj = ℓj − nj > 0. According to the division algorithm, there is a unique
h satisfying ℓ0 = t · mj + h where 0 ≤ h < mj. Then, clearly

[h, b1, b2, . . . , bj−1, bj + s + t, ℓj+1, . . . , ℓk]m

is an m-ary partition of n. We then note that

[h′, 0, 0, . . . , 0, bj + s + t, ℓj+1, . . . , ℓk]m

is an m-ary partition of n where h′ := h + Pj−1

i=1 bi = Pj−1

i=0 ni < mj. This implies that

[0, 0, 0, . . . , 0, bj + s + t, ℓj+1, . . . , ℓk]m

3

is an m-ary partition of n′ = (0, 0, . . . , 0, nj, nj+1, . . . , nk)m. However, since nj = bj and
s + t > 0, then 0 < s + t = Pk
i=j+1(ni − ℓi) · mi−j. Thus, s + t = mr for some r ≥ 1 as
required. Finally, we see that bj + mr is the largest number of parts of the form mj we can
have without reducing some ℓi with i > j.

(cid:3)

Corollary 2.5. Let ℓ be a non-simple m-ary partition of n = (n0, n1, . . . , nk)m with ℓ ∈
f −1
m,n(b) where b = (b0, b1, ..., bk)m. Suppose that ℓ is of the form

ℓ = [ℓ0, b1, b2, . . . , bj−1, ℓj, ℓj+1, . . . , ℓk]m

with ℓj > nj = bj. Then there is an m-ary partition of the form [v, b1, b2, . . . , bj−1, u, ℓj+1, . . . , ℓk]m
for all bj < u ≤ bj + mr where r is given by Lemma 2.4.

Proof. Let bj < u ≤ bj +mr and consider the partition of the form ρ = [h, b1, b2, . . . , bj−1, bj +
mr, ℓj+1, . . . , ℓk]m guaranteed by Lemma 2.4. We then ﬁnd y such that bj + mr = u + y where
y ≥ 0. Then we construct an m-ary partition from ρ by converting y parts of the form mj
to y · mj parts of the form m0, obtaining the partition

[h + y · mj, b1, b2, . . . , bj−1, u, ℓj+1, . . . , ℓk]m

as required.

(cid:3)

Now, ﬁx b ≪m n with f −1

m,n(b) 6= ∅. For each 1 ≤ z ≤ k, we deﬁne

B(z) := {ρ ∈ f −1

m,n(b) | min{i ≥ 1 | ρi 6= bi} = z}.

Again, the following lemma is clear by construction.

Lemma 2.6. Let b ≪m n with f −1
forms a partition of f −1

m,n(b).

m,n(b) 6= ∅. The the collection of sets {B(z) | B(z) 6= ∅}

As our ﬁnal step, we ﬁx z with 1 ≤ z ≤ k such that B(z) 6= ∅. Now, we deﬁne a relation

on B(z) as follows. We say ρ ≃b,z γ if γi = ρi for all i > z.

Lemma 2.7. The relation ≃b,z on B(z) is an equivalence relation and so provides a partition
of B(z).

Proof. This is again clear by construction.

(cid:3)

Proposition 2.8. Let n ∈ N, b ∈ N with b ≪m n and 1 ≤ z ≤ k such that f −1
m,n(b) 6= ∅ and
B(z) 6= ∅. Then the nops function is equidistributed modulo m on each equivalence class of
≃b,z.

Proof. Suppose the C is an equivalence class of ≃b,z. Then by construction, there exists
ℓz+1, ℓz+2, . . . , ℓk such that every partition in C is of the form

[h, b1, b2, . . . , bz−1, h′, ℓz+1, ℓz+2, . . . , ℓk]m

for some h and h′ with h′ > bz. Now according to Lemma 2.5 and Corollary 2.5, there exists
some r ≥ 1 such that

C = {[h, b1, b2, . . . , bz−1, u, ℓz+1, ℓz+2, . . . , ℓk]m | h ∈ N and bj < u ≤ bj + mr}.

Thus |C| = mr. Now, for each 1 ≤ w ≤ m we deﬁne

Cw = {[hj, b1, b2, . . . , bj + w + jm, ℓz+1, ℓz+2, . . . , ℓk]m | 1 ≤ j ≤ (r − 1)},

4

and we note that |Cw| = r−1 for all w and the set {Cw} forms a partition of C. Moreover, for
each w, nops(γ) ≡ nops(ρ) (mod m) for all γ, ρ ∈ Cw, and nops(ρ) ≡ nops(γ) + 1 (mod m)
whenever γ ∈ Cw and ρ ∈ Cw+1.
(cid:3)

3. Proof of Theorem 1.2 and Consequences

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Let b ≪n n with f −1
m,n(b) 6= ∅. Then, let 1 ≤ z ≤ k with B(z) be
non-empty. By Proposition 2.8 and Lemma 2.7 , the nops function is equidistributed mod
m on B(z). Likewise, by Lemma 2.6, the nops function is equidistributed mod m on f −1
m,n(b).
Finally, Lemma 2.2 implies that the nops function is equidistributed mod m on Nm(n). (cid:3)

Let n = (n0, n1, . . . , nk)m. Then, according to Theorem 1.2, Nm(n) = m · q where q is the
number of non-simple m-ary partitions with with number of parts divisible by m. However,
it is clear that there is a bijection between simple m-ary partitions of n and the integers
equivalent to n mod m that are m-dominated by n:

[ℓ0, b1, b2, . . . , bk]m ←→ (n0, b1, b2, . . . , bk)m.

As previously mentioned, there are Qk
i=1(ni + 1) integers equivalent to n mod m that are
m-dominated by n (see [4] and use the fact that b is equivalent n mod m if and only if
b0 = n0). Thus, we see that

bm(n) = |Nm(n)| + |Sm(n)| = m · q +

k

Y

i=1

(ni + 1)

so that Corollary 1.3 holds.

Understanding the nops function on Nm(n) allows us to characterize when the nops func-

tion is equidistributed mod m on the entire set of m-ary partitions, Pm(n).

Corollary 3.1. The nops function is equidistributed modulo m on Pm(n) if and only if nops
is equidistributed modulo m on the simple m-ary partitions, Sm(n).

Proof. This follows from Theorem 1.2 since Pm(n) is the disjoint union of Nm(n) and Sm(n).
(cid:3)

Theorem 3.2. Let m ≥ 2 and let n = (n0, n1, . . . , nk)m be the base-m representation of
n. Then the nops function is equidistributed modulo m on Pm(n) if and only if the set
{n1, n2, . . . , nk} contains m − 1.

Proof. First, suppose that ni = m − 1 for some i ≥ 1. Due to Corollary 3.1, we need to show
that the nops function is equidistributed on Sm(n). Now, for each w ∈ {0, 1, . . . , m − 1}, let

Aw = {ℓ ∈ Sm(n) | ℓi = w}.

Then, it is clear that {Aw | w ∈ {0, 1, . . . , m−1} forms a set partition of Sm(n). Furthermore,
since all the m-ary partitions in Aw are simple, there is a bijection gw,w′ : Aw → Aw′ given
by

gw,w′((ℓ0, ℓ1, . . . , w, . . . , ℓk)) := (ℓ0 + (w − w′) · mi, ℓ1, . . . , w′, . . . , ℓk)

so that |Aw| = |Aw′| for all w, w′ ∈ {0, 1, . . . , m − 1}. Finally, let ℓ ∈ A0. Then for each
w ∈ {0, 1, . . . , m−1} we have nops(g0,w(ℓ)) ≡ nops(ℓ)+w (mod m). Thus the nops function
is equidistributed mod m on Sm(n).

Conversely, suppose that m−1 6∈ {n1, . . . , nk}. First, assume that the only nonzero base-m
digits are n0 and nk so that by assumption nk ≤ m − 2. Then, there are only nk + 1 ≤ m − 1

5

simple partitions, and so the nops function cannot be equidistributed mod m on Sm(n).
Next, assume that 0 < nj ≤ m − 2 for some 1 ≤ j < k. Similar to the previous paragraph,
for each w ∈ {0, 1, . . . , nj}, let

Aw = {ℓ ∈ Sm(n) | ℓj = w}.

As before, |Aw| = |Aw′| for all w, w′ ∈ {0, 1, . . . , nj} and for each ℓ ∈ A0 and each w ∈
{0, 1, . . . , nj} we have nops(g0,w(ℓ)) ≡ nops(ℓ) + w (mod m). Since nj ≤ m − 2, then the
nops function will be equidistributed mod m on Sm(n) if and only if the nops function
is equidistributed mod m on A0. However, we see that there is a bijection h : A0 →
Sm(n − nj · mj) given by

h((ℓ0, ℓ1, . . . , 0, . . . , ℓk)) := (ℓ0 − nj · mj, ℓ1, . . . , 0, . . . , ℓk).

Moreover, we note that nops(h(ℓ)) ≡ nops(ℓ) (mod m) so that nops is equidistributed mod
m on A0 if and only if nops is equidistributed mod m on Sm(n − nj · mj), which implies
that nops is equidistributed mod m on Sm(n) if and only if nops is equidistributed mod
m on Sm(n − nj · mj). Since the digit sets of n and n − nj · mj are identical except in
position j, we can use this argument to deduce that nops is equidistributed mod m on
i=1 ni · mi(cid:17). However,
i=1 ni · mi = (n0, 0, . . . , 0, nk) and nk ≤ m − 2; in this case, we have already shown
(cid:3)

Sm(n) if and only if nops is equidistributed mod m on Sm (cid:16)n − Pk−1
n − Pk−1
that nops is not equidistributed mod m Sm (cid:16)n − Pk−1

i=1 ni · mi(cid:17). The result follows.

4. Detailed Example

We illustrate the results of the previous two sections with an example. Let m = 3 and
consider n = 60 = (0, 2, 0, 2)3. Then the total number of 3-ary partitions of 60 is 117, i.e.
b3(60) = 117. Of these 117, there are 9 simple partitions listed in the box below.

S3(60)

[0, 2, 0, 2], [3, 1, 0, 2], [6, 0, 0, 2], [27, 2, 0, 1], [30, 1, 0, 1], [33, 0, 0, 1], [54, 2, 0, 0],
[57, 1, 0, 0], [60, 0, 0, 0]

In the next two pages, we list the remaining 108 non-simple partitions, those in N3(60),

using the results in Section 2. The numbers 3-dominated by 60 are

0, 3, 6, 27, 30, 33, 54, 57, 60.

Let f represent f3,60. It turns out that f −1(54), f −1(57), and f −1(60) are all empty. There
are 6 partitions in f −1(0) and f −1(3); there are 69 partitions in f −1(6); there are 3 partitions
in f −1(27) and f −1(30); and there are 21 partitions in f −1(33). All of the nonempty inverse
images are listed below; the subsets correspond to the nonempty sets B(z) for 1 ≤ z ≤ 3 and
then the subsets of B(z) correspond to the partition given by ≃b,z guaranteed by Lemma
2.7. The most representative example is that of f −1(6) as it contains both B(1) and B(2)
(B(3) = ∅) and B(1) is further partitioned into six equivalence classes for ≃6,1.

We can then check that each the cardinality of the equivalence classes of ≃b,z is a multiple
of 3 and the nops function is equidistributed mod 3 on these smallest parts (see the proof of
Theorem 1.2) thus showing that the nops function is equidistributed on N3(60).

5. Extensions

In this section, we brieﬂy discuss a possible way to extend our results to other congruence

relations. We note that the set of non-simple m-ary partitions Nm(n) can be deﬁned as

Nm(n) = {ℓ ∈ Pm(n) | ℓj > nj for some j ≥ 1}

where n = (n0, . . . , nk)m is the base-m representation of n. Consider the following general-
izations. For any c ≥ 1, we let

Nm,c = {ℓ ∈ Pm(n) | ℓj > nj, ℓj+1 = nj+1, . . . , ℓj+c = nj+c for some j ≥ 1},

where we note that Nm(n) can be interpreted as Nm,0. Then, we can prove a result analogous
to Lemma 2.4 that shows |Nm,c| ≡ 0 (mod mc+1). Therefore, if we can determine the size of
the set

Sm,c(n) := Pm(n) \ Nm,c(n)

using only knowledge of n (possibly the base-m representation of n), then we will obtain
interesting congruence properties for bm(n) mod mc+1 for any c.
