We study parafermion chains with Zk symmetry subject to a periodic binary drive. We focus
on the case k = 3. We ﬁnd that the chains support diﬀerent Floquet edge modes at nontrivial
quasienergies, distinct from those for the static system. We map out the corresponding phase
diagram by a combination of analytics and numerics, and provide the location of 2π/3 modes in
parameter space. We also show that the modes are robust to weak disorder. While the previously
studied Z2-invariant Majorana systems posesses a transparent weakly interacting case where the
existence of a π-Majorana mode is manifest, our intrinsically strongly interacting generalization
demonstrates that the existence of such a limit is not necessary.

INTRODUCTION

The advent of experimental systems exhibiting long
quantum mechanical coherence times has generated
much interest in the question of how macroscopically
observable behavior emerges from the underlying many-
body time evolution. In particular, the possibility of driv-
ing coherent many-body systems out of equilibrium has
opened a new window on the fundamental question of
how to describe systems for which the concepts of equi-
librium thermodynamics are a priori inapplicable [1, 2].
For periodically driven systems, there has been consid-
erable progress in understanding how the roles of equi-
libration, thermalization and ordering, need to be mod-
iﬁed in order to generalize the notions from thermody-
namic equilibrium to this out of equilibrium situation. [3–
7] While the notion of temperature is lost in the absence
of a time-translation invariant Hamiltonian, three dis-
tinct thermodynamic ensembles have been identiﬁed: a
generic Floquet-ETH ensemble, corresponding to an ‘inﬁ-
nite temperature’ ensemble of the undriven Hamiltonian;
a periodic Gibbs ensemble generalising the concept of the
generalised Gibbs ensemble of integrable undriven sys-
tems; and ﬁnally, a Floquet-MBL ensemble, where ergod-
icity breaking due to many-body localisation occurs [8, 9]
While the Floquet-ETH ensemble does not support
any notion of ordering on account of its entirely feature-
less ‘inﬁnite temperature’ correlations, a recently pro-
posed notion of ordering in the presence of MBL does
generalise to the Floquet-MBL regime, namely that of
eigenstate ordering [10, 11]. The notion of eigenstate or-
der appeals to the idea of symmetry-breaking manifesting
itself in thermodynamic-limit degeneracies of eigenstates.
Partners in such quasi-degenerate multiplets of many-
body eigenstates can exhibit ﬁnite expectation value of
an Edwards-Anderson-like order parameter, or indeed
topological forms of order, not only in the ground state
but also in the excited state spectrum.

The generalisation of this set of ideas to the Floquet
realm proceeds via the recognition that Floquet systems
also support the notion of eigenstates with a quasi-energy
(deﬁned modulo the energy corresponding to the driving
frequency, ω)[12]; this is provided by the eigensystem of

the stroboscopic time evolution operator over a driving
period T = 2π/ω. Besides extending the notion of eigen-
state order to the Floquet realm, this has allowed the
deﬁnition of new types of order, distinguishable only in
the time-dependence of the order parameter, which have
no correspondence in the undriven setting [12].

Investigations of this new type of order, e.g. from the
point of view of its universal properties [13], is only at its
beginning. Here, we present an analysis of a driven Zn
symmetric clock model and its edge mode properties [14–
19]. We focus on the Z3-symmetric clock-model, which
is equivalent to a Z3 parafermion chain under a Jordan
Wigner transformation.

The motivation for this is threefold. Firstly, it is to
provide further examples of the new Floquet ordering
phenomena beyond the very simplest and so far only
studied case of π Floquet-Ising order[12, 13, 20–22], in
order to assist and test more general schemes for clas-
sifying Floquet-MBL ordering physics. Secondly, unlike
the driven Ising models previously studied, this model
has no non-interacting limit. This poses both questions
of principle, about the role presence or absence of such
a limit plays, and raises the question in practice how to
locate novel ordered phases and illuminate their proper-
ties in the absence of the non-interacting solution as a
guide. Thirdly, the model we consider is of autonomous
interest as an implementation of an anyonic chain, with
the aim of realizing platforms for topological quantum
computation–edge modes of parafermionic chains provide
a starting point for achieving approximations to general
qubit rotations. In light of the previous studies indicating
presence of edge modes in a driven Majorana chain, it is
natural to consider the edge properties of a periodically
driven parafermionic chain.

We ﬁnd that there does indeed exist rich edge mode

previously studied Z2 case of a driven Majorana chain,
in which the algebra of the edge operator Ψ2 = 1 forces
its quasi-energy to be 0 or π, a parafermionic edge mode
satisfying Ψ3 = 1 can have an energy of 0 or ± 2π
3 . The
presence of a ± 2π
3 mode implies that Ψ and Ψ2 add 2π/3
and −2π/3 (equivalent to 4π/3) to the quasi-energy of a
state, and Ψ3 acts trivially on any state. The presence of
a zero mode implies Ψ, Ψ2 map states to new ones with

the same quasienergy. A general Zn symmetric system
can instead have modes of quasienergies 2π/k where k
is any factor of n. For the case of n = 3, we determine
the locations of the parameter regimes supporting these
0 and ± 2π
3 modes, provide diagnostics conﬁrming their
presence and explore the phase diagram using the spec-
tral function of the edge clock-operators in a ﬁnite sized
open chain numerically. We also address their robustness
by considering the evolution of the diagnostics when dis-
order is added.
In Sec. II, we de-
scribe the periodically driven Zn symmetric system. The
protocol proposed is a generalization of the binary drive
protocol previously shown to result in zero and π Ma-
jorana edge modes in a transverse ﬁeld Ising model.[20–
22] We speciﬁcally focus on the Z3 case, describing the
model in the static and the driven case. In Sec-III, using
general arguments, we show that the periodically driven
system can have edge modes of quasi-energy 0 or ± 2π
3 in
contrast to the static system which only displays zero-
energy modes. We deduce the parameter regimes where
the 0 and ± 2π
3 edge modes are expected. In Secs. IV we
introduce the spectral function of an edge operator and
use it to numerically map out a phase diagram.

II. PERIODICALLY DRIVEN Zn CHAIN

The periodically driven Zn clock chain can be de-
scribed in terms of clock operators σi associated with
each lattice point of an open chain of length L. The
clock at each site i is associated with an n-dimensional
Hilbert space, spanned by the n orthonormal eigenvec-
tors |s(cid:105), s = 0, 2, . . . , n − 1 of σ with eigenvalues ωs,

(cid:3) is the nth root of 1. An op-

where ω = exp(cid:2) 2πı

erator τ at each site shifts these eigenstates through
τ |s(cid:105) = |s + 1 (mod n)(cid:105). The operators at diﬀerent sites
commute, while at a given site they satisfy the following
algebra

n

σn = τ n = 1; σ† = σn−1; τ† = τ n−1; στ = ωτ σ.

The driven system that we study represents a binary
drive in which the system evolves with a Hamiltonian HJ
that stabilizes an ordered phase, and a Hamiltonian Hh
which stabilizes a disordered phase for the ﬁrst and sec-
ond halves of each time period. The state of the system
|ϕr(cid:105) at time t = rT evolves as |ϕr+1(cid:105) = U |ϕr(cid:105) where U
is given by

U (J, h) = exp [−ıHh] exp [−ıHJ ] .

energy 0, π, or both, are present.

The coupling constants Jm, hm ∈ C satisfy Jm = ¯Jn−m
and hm = ¯hn−m, which enforces Hermiticity of the
Hamiltonians.

The eigenstates of the unitary operator U are known
as Floquet states, and their eigenvalues exp(in) yield
quasi-energies n deﬁned modulo 2π. Since U commutes
with the Zn charge operator

Qn =

(4)

the Floquet eigenstates are associated with a Zn charge
which takes values from {ωs}s=1→n

The simplest case, namely that of the Z2 symmet-
ric system [20, 22], can be mapped, after a non-local
Jordan Wigner transformation, to a system of Majo-
rana fermions on a chain.
In the language of the Ma-
jorana fermionic variables, the two Hamiltonians men-
tioned above stabilize phases with alternate dimerization
patterns. The quadratic nature of the fermionic system
allows a decomposition of the system into a set of non-
interacting single-particle modes each carrying a ﬁxed
quasi-energy. A key feature of the model is the presence
of modes localized at the edge of the system, and which
can carry a quasi-energy of exactly 0 or π. The phase
diagram of the system (Fig-1) [12] has a detailed under-
standing based on a transfer matrix approach that relies
critically on the non-interacting nature of the system [13].

In this work, we aim to understand case of the more
general Zn symmetric system. The key diﬀerence from
the Z2 case is the strongly interacting nature preventing
a decomposition into independent modes. We focus on
the Z3 system beginning with a summary of the results
known in the static system.

A. Z3 symmetric clock model

In addition to having a larger parameter space, the Z3
symmetric system is qualitatively diﬀerent from the Z2
case due the absence of a non-interacting limit with in-
dependent modes. The presence of an independent edge
mode in such a system is therefore not a priori a simple
extension of the Z2 case. The properties of the static
system will be shown in the latter sections to have bear-
ings for domains in parameter space supporting the edge
modes for the driven case.

1. Static system

The static chiral Z3 clock model is described by a Z3
invariant nearest neighbor interaction Hamiltonian act-
ing on a clock-chain [14, 16, 17]

where σi and τi act on the clock at the site i of an open
chain of length L, and J, h ∈ C. The above Hamiltonian
commutes with the Z3 charge operator Q ≡ Q3 (Eq-4).
All eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are three-fold degen-
J | in a ﬁnite system, it
erate at h = 0. For small ﬁnite | h
was argued in Ref-15 that the three lowest energy eigen-
states have an energy splitting that exponentially de-
cays with system size,[23] whereas higher energy triplets
are expected to have energy splittings that decay with
a power law. However, for arg(J) outside a small ﬁnite
neighborhood of 0 (mod π/3), frustration in domain wall
tunneling results in a regime of small | h
all energy eigenstate triplets have energy splittings that
exponentially decay with the system size. The most ro-
bust degeneracies occur at arg(J) = π

These degeneracies disappear for | h

The clock-model can equivalently be described [24, 25]
in a language where the local variables are parafermions
χ and ψ, which are related to the above clock variables
through a Jordan-Wigner transformation [26]

At h = 0, there are two parafermionic operators
ΨLeft = χ1 and ΨRight = ψL which commute with the
Hamiltonian Eq-9. These operators cyclically change the
Z3 charge of the states due to the commutation relation
ΨQ = ωQΨ. As a result, Ψs are associated with zero-
energy parafermionic edge modes.

Perturbative arguments presented in Ref-14, and nu-
merical results in Ref-15, suggest that regimes with
an exponential decay with system size of the energy-
splittings coincide with regimes with parafermionic zero-
modes localized at the edge.
In particular for arg(J)
away from 0 (mod π/3) , we expect a ﬁnite range of
|h/J| in which a zero energy parafermionic mode is lo-
calized at the edge. Since degeneracies are most robust
at arg(J) = π
3 ), we expect the zero-mode to be
strongly localized at the edge in this case.

2. Periodically driven Z3 system

The periodically driven Z3 model corresponds to the
n = 3 version of the driven Zn model described in Eq-
3. Since Hermiticity requires that hm=1 = ¯hm=2 and
Jm=1 = ¯Jm=2, the unitary operator U depends only on
two complex parameters which we shall denote by h and
J. Speciﬁcally,

where the operators σ and τ satisfy the n = 3 version of
the operator algebra in Eq-1. In the following sections,
we argue that the system supports 0 and ±2π/3 quasi-
energy parafermion edge modes. From simple algebraic
properties of the unitary operator, we infer the relative
location of the regions supporting the edge modes of 0
and ±2π/3 modes. The assumptions and the inferences
are validated by numerical studies of ﬁnite systems pre-
sented in the latter sections.

In this section, we present general arguments predict-
ing the qualitative structure of the edge modes in the
model described in Eq-10, for a cross-section of parame-
ter space deﬁned by varying h for a ﬁxed J.

First we make the notion of the edge mode precise
in the language of a many body system. The periodic
system described by U carries a mode Ψ of quasienergy

changes its quasienergy to 2πp/n + E:

where we have used U (0, z) = Qp
ΨJ,hU (J, h), and QnΨ = ωΨQn.

n, U (J, h)ΨJ,h =
Since the result is true for any eigenstate |φ(cid:105), we have
the result that the zero mode ΨJ,h of U (J, h) is a mode
of quasienergy 2πp/n of U (J, h + z).

The operator ΨJ,h adds quasienergies in steps of 2π/k
where k is the denominator of p
n in its reduced form.
In particular, for n prime, for any p (cid:54)= 0, the edge mode
adds quasienergies in steps of 2π/n. For the case of p = 0,
ΨJ,h is a zero mode of U (J, h + z).

B. Algebraic determination of edge-mode location

for the Z3 chain

We now focus on the speciﬁc case of n = 3. Occurrence
of a mode of quasienergy 4π/3 is equivalent to occurrence
of one with quasienergy 2π/3 as this is simply a relabeling
Ψ with Ψ2. In order to understand the locations in the
parameter space of the 2π/3 modes and zero modes, we
look for the solutions of the equation U (0, z) ∝ Qp

p = 1, 2 and p = 0 respectively ie

In summary, the arguments presented in this section
imply that, since h = 0 has an exact zero mode, the
points h = z0 and h = z (Eq-14 and Eq-15), have ex-
act zero and 2π/3 modes respectively. Additionally, if
there is a domain around h = 0 that supports a zero

 if Ψ maps any eigenstate of U to a new normalizable
state and satisﬁes U Ψ = e−ıΨU . The mode is localized
at the edge if the diﬀerence between the states |φ(cid:105) and
Ψ|φ(cid:105) decays exponentially with the distance from the
edge for any |φ(cid:105). A measure of the diﬀerence can be
chosen to be the norm of the diﬀerence in the reduced
density matrices away from the edge.

A. Existence of non-trivial edge modes for general

Zn

The Zn-symmetric system U (J, h = 0) (Eq-3) has two
zero mode localized at the edges: Ψ0,Left = σ1 and
Ψ0,Right ∝ σz
L. From the commutation relations satis-
ﬁed by Ψ, it can be seen that they cyclically change the
Zn charge Qn, ensuring that the action on the states are
non-trivial.

One of our central results is the connection between
the existence of a zero quasienergy mode and that of
modes with non-trivial quasi-energy if the parameters are
shifted by an amount z. This connection is established,
and z determined, as follows.

Assuming a zero quasienergy edge mode ΨJ,h (ie
ΨJ,hU (J, h) = U (J, h)ΨJ,h) which cyclically changes Qn
(ie QnΨ = ωΨQn, ω being nth root of unity) persists
in a ﬁnite neighbourhood of h = 0, consider the sys-
tem described by U (J, h + z), where z is a solution to
U (0, z) ∝ Qp
n, for a some speciﬁc integer 0 ≤ p < n.
Let |φ(cid:105) be an eigenstate of the system U (J, h + z) with
quasienergy E. Action of the edge mode ΨJ,h on |φ(cid:105)

mode, there are domains around h = z and h = z0, which
also support zero or 2π/3 modes. All such domains have
identical shape in the parameter space, since they can be
translated to each other by z and z0.

In order to make further progress in understanding the
phase diagram of the driven parafermion chain, as well
as validate the assumptions made above, we rely on com-
putational results described in the remaining sections.

panels show the complex h plane in the parameter space de-
ﬁned by J = ı, showing the solutions of z (empty circles)

Our numerical studies focus on the following questions

S1(En, η) =

1. Does a zero mode exist in a ﬁnite region in the

parameter space around h = 0 ?

2. How does the size of the above region depend on
arg(J)? Based on the results in the static case,[15]
we expect no such region for arg(J) = 0 (mod π
3 ),
and a robust zero-mode localization for arg(J) =
π
6 (mod π

3 ).

3. How does the phase diagram in the complex h plane

depend on |J| ?

4. Are the edge modes robust in the presence of dis-

order ?

We infer the answers to the above questions as far as
possible using small ﬁnite size systems by analyzing the
spectral function of the clock-operator σ1, which we de-
scribe in the following subsection.

for any state |En(cid:105) in the spectrum, |E(cid:105) being the eigen-
vectors (illustrated in system-A of Fig-3).

At ﬁnite h, if there is a zero energy edge mode, then
a similar sharp peak should be visible in the spectral
function S1(En, η) but with σ1 replaced by ΨJ,h. Since
an exact expression for ΨJ,h is not available, we continue
to use the spectral function S1(En, η) as deﬁned in Eq-
16 to probe the edge mode even at ﬁnite |h|. As |h| is
increased, the spectral peak reduces in size since σ1 now
deviates from the edge mode ΨJ,h. However if ΨJ,h is
still localized close to the edge, this |h|-dependence of S1
should be independent of system size. In contrast, once
the localization length is of the order of the available
system size, we expect strong system size dependence in
S1(h), due to the lifting of the degeneracies, which should
presage an absence of the edge mode. Thus system size
dependence of spectral function indicates a mode that

smallest when arg(J) = π/6 (mod π/3) and 0 (mod π/3) respectively. Fig-6 shows the relative locations of these planes in a

a 2π/3-mode, σ1 could in general be a linear combination
of Ψ and Ψ† which scatters a state at En to a linear
combination of the ones at En ± 2π

Fig-4 illustrates the dependence of O0 and O2π/3 as h is
increased away from 0 along paths in two diﬀerent planes
(depicted in the inset) deﬁned by J = ı (left, middle
panels) and J = 1 (right panel).
The rapid decay of O0 with |h|, along with the strong
system size dependence in the J = 1 case (right panel), is
indicative of an absence of a localized edge-mode in the
thermodynamic limit. By contrast, there are locations
(middle panel) where both order parameters appear well-
converged and nonzero, indicating coexistence of both
zero and 2π/3 edge modes.

B. Phase Diagram

In this section, we present the results from numerically
scanning through various cross-sections of the parameter
space. The contour plots of O presented here should be
interpreted as phase diagrams, in the sense that regions
of well-converged and typically not too small O repre-
sent phases with an edge mode, while other regions do
not exhibit one. Precise location of the transition lines
between these regions are not reliably pinned down due
to the small sizes accessible to our numerics.

For diﬀerent constant J cross sections that we have
studied, the phase diagram has the structure displayed
in Fig-2. There is a parameter domain supporting a zero
and a 2π/3 edge mode surrounding the set of points z0
(Eq-14) and z (Eq-15) respectively (unﬁlled and ﬁlled
circles in Fig-2).

system sizes.
In order to numerically probe the presence of a zero
mode, we consider the eigenstate order parameters O0
and O 2π
, which describe an ordering in the many-body
spectra, and which are deﬁned as follows. O0 is the total
spectral weight in a window of size q = 0.05 in η, aver-

show that the domains increase in size as |J| increases from 0. For larger |J|, the domain size varies periodically.

C. Eﬀect of disorder

Upon changing J, the domains supporting an edge-
mode change in size but are always centered around z
and z0, as can be seen from Fig-5 and Fig-7. All such
domains in a complex h-plane expand and shrink syn-
chronously as J is tuned. This is consistent with results
in Sec-III, which suggests that the domains in a single
h-plane are images of each other under translations by
z and z0. The size of the domains increase as |J| is in-
creased from 0 (Fig-8). The domains are largest and
smallest for arg(J) = π/6 (mod π/3) and 0 (mod π/3)
respectively (Fig-6), similar to what was found in the
static case (Sec-II A 1).

In order to probe the robustness of the edge-mode in
the presence of disorder, we studied systems with disor-
der in the transverse ﬁeld ie

L(cid:88)

Hh =

hiτi + h.c.

(20)

i=1

Disorder was introduced in the magnitude of the trans-
verse ﬁeld ie hi = (|h|mean +δhi) exp(ı arg(hmean)), where
δhi is picked from a uniform distribution over [−w, w], w
parametrising the strength of the disorder. Fig-9 shows
O0, averaged over 100 disorder realizations. x-axis corre-
sponds to a line parametrized by Im(hmean) between the
center of a domain (J, h) = (ı, 0) to (ı, ıπ/
3). For the

√

case considered here, the peak in the spectral function,
appears to persist to ﬁnite disroder strength, indicating
robustness of the edge mode to this form of disorder.
Since results in Sec-III imply that O0(J,{hi}) =
O 2π
(J,{hi + z}) = O0(J,{hi + z0}), z, z0 translate the
domains supporting edge modes in a disorder averaged
system into each other. The results shown here are thus
representative of every domain for a given J.

V. CONCLUSION

In summary, we have analyzed a strongly-interacting,
periodically-driven parafermion chain. We have shown
numerically that there exist domains in parameter space
that support zero energy edge modes. From the alge-
braic properties of the edge mode together with numeri-
cal methods, we have shown that the system can support
2π/3 energy edge modes for n = 3 and identiﬁed the qual-
itative structure of the of the phase diagram in the four
dimensional parameter space. The arguments provided
here generalize to the case of Zn symmetric chains, which
can in general support quasienergy 2π
k (k being a factor
of n) modes in various parts of the phase diagram. We
derive the equations governing the location of the edge
modes in the appendix.

These chains thus provide a second,

intrinsically
strongly interacting, example of non-trivial Floquet edge
modes beyond the previously known Z2 with their π-
Majorana modes transparently arising in a weakly inter-
acting limit absent for the parafermions. Besides pro-
viding a concrete generalisation of Floquet edge mode
physics, it can also be seen as making connection between
the known and special Z2 case and more abstract clas-
siﬁcation schemes [28–30] . An interesting result found
in the previously-studied Z2 chains is a disorder-induced
stabilization of a spin glass Edwards-Anderson order in
higher energy eigenstates.[10, 12] It would be of interest
to explore this physics in the clock-chain as well; however,
for the system sizes currently easily accessible a reliable
ﬁnite size scaling analysis of such an order parameter is
not straightforward.

Appendix A: Solutions to z

In order to locate the domains supporting edge modes,
as described in Sec-III, we seek the solutions to z of
U (0, z) ∝ Qp

and Q3 (Eq-4), we get

τ p. Since τ† = τ 2, both sides can be simultaneously
diagonalized, to obtain

that this is satisﬁed if and only if exp(cid:2)ı(zτ + ¯zτ†)(cid:3) ∝

The general Zn model described by Eq-3 has complex
parameters Jm and hm for 1 ≤ m ≤ n − 1, satisfying
Jm = ¯Jn−m and hm = ¯hn−m. The condition governing
the location (cid:126)zp (a vector representing {hm}m=1→n−1 and
satisfying [zp]m = [zp]n−m) of 2πp/n modes (0 ≤ p < n)
are the n − 1 equations

with ω = exp[2πı/n]. Upon taking logarithms, these
form a set of linear equations, with an n− 1 dimensional
lattice of solutions. For each p, given one solution, a
whole lattice of solutions can be obtained by translating
any one solution by (cid:126)z0.
The edge mode Ψ of Zn generate a cyclic group of or-
der n, and the quasienergies added by these operators
form a group homomorphic to it. For 0 ≤ p, p(cid:48) < n,
the quasienergies added by the edge operators at (cid:126)zp, (cid:126)zp(cid:48)
are isomorphic if g.c.d(n, p) = g.c.d(n, p(cid:48)).
In particu-
lar for prime n, edge mode quasienergies at (cid:126)zp form a
cyclic group of order n for any p (cid:54)= 0, and therefore have

quasienergy 2π/n. For n = 6, (cid:126)z1 and (cid:126)z5 have edge mode
quasienergies forming a cyclic group of order 6, generated

by 2π/6; (cid:126)z2 and (cid:126)z4 have edge modes quasienergies of or-
der 3 generated by 2π/3; (cid:126)z3 has an edge mode quasiener-
gies of order 2 resulting in π modes.
