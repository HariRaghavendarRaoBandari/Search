Estimating space-time parameters with a quantum probe in a lossy environment

(Dated: March 8, 2016)

We study the problem of estimating the Schwarzschild radius of a massive body using Gaussian
quantum probe states. Previous calculations assumed that the probe state remained pure after
propagating a large distance.
In a realistic scenario, there would be inevitable losses. Here we
introduce a practical approach to calculate the Quantum Fisher Informations (QFIs) for a quantum
probe that has passed through a lossy channel. Whilst for many situations loss means coherent states
are optimal, we identify certain situations for which squeezed states have an advantage. We also
study the eﬀect of the frequency proﬁle of the wavepacket propagating from Alice to Bob. There
exists an optimal operating point for a chosen mode proﬁle.
In particular, employing a smooth
rectangular frequency proﬁle signiﬁcantly improves the error bound on the Schwarzschild radius
compared to a Gaussian frequency proﬁle.

INTRODUCTION

region of the parameter space was explored.

The precision with which physical parameters can be
estimated is limited by the level of ﬂuctuations or noise
in the measurement device.
In general, quantum me-
chanics introduces irreducible levels of noise onto mea-
surement results, and hence quantum mechanics places
limits on the ultimate precision of parameter estimation.
The study of these limits and the development of proto-
cols for reaching them is called quantum metrology [1].
In optics, the use of semi-classical probe states such as
coherent states, where the quantum noise can be inter-
preted as photon shot-noise, leads to a standard quan-
tum limit. To surpass this limit requires the use of non-
classical states displaying squeezing or entanglement [2].
Most quantum metrology assumes non-relativistic
quantum mechanics. However, many applications of
quantum metrology relate to relativistic phenomena such
as gravitational waves [3] and the estimation of gravi-
tational ﬁelds and accelerations [4]. More rigorous ap-
proaches to such problems, that will become important
as precision grows, use relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory
to describe the quantum interactions in spacetime [5]. A
number of authors have begun exploring such approaches
[6–8].

Recently Bruschi et al [10] showed that techniques
for optimally estimating the transmission parameter of
a quantum channel [9] can be adapted to the relativis-
tic problem of estimating the Schwarzschild radius of a
massive body. Their protocol involves coherently com-
paring a quantum optical probe state prepared at one
height in the metric with a second, locally identical probe
state, prepared at a diﬀerent height. They investigated
the use of optical probes prepared in coherent states and
squeezed states and found that using squeezed vacuum
states was optimal. However, the calculations of Ref.[10]
assumed that losses could be neglected, even though the
probe states potentially needed to be propagated over
large distances in the protocol. In addition, only Gaus-
sian temporal wave-packets were considered and a limited

In this paper we analyse a more realistic version of the
Bruschi et al protocol that includes the inevitable losses
that would occur in such a scheme in practice and opti-
mises the parameters with respect to height, bandwidth,
mode-shape and operating point. We ﬁnd that squeez-
ing is not always optimal but can enhance precision under
certain conditions. In our analysis we introduce a diﬀer-
ent approach to obtaining the Fisher information for this
protocol which turns out to be much easier to generalize
to more realistic scenarios.

The paper is arranged in the following way.

In the
next section we review the basic principles of estimating
the transmission parameters of a quantum channel using
a quantum probe, describing our approach to obtaining
the relevant quantum Fisher informations and calculat-
ing results for mixed probe states. In section III we re-
view how this approach can be adapted to estimating
parameters associated with space-time curvature, in par-
ticular the Schwarzschild radius, rs, of a massive body.
In section IV we apply our formalism to this problem and
derive expressions for the relative errors in estimating rs
in a number of idealised scenarios. We make more realis-
tic assumptions in section V, for example incorporating
loss as a function of transmission distance and consid-
ering bright coherent beams with added squeezing. We
conclude and discuss in section V.

II. TRANSMISSION OF A QUANTUM

CHANNEL

The goal of any quantum estimation is to determine a
probe state and probability operator-value measurement
(POVM) represented by the estimator ˆΘ and to deter-
mine the value of Θ from the set of N measured out-
comes [9]. We consider an unbiased estimator such that
for N → ∞, the expectation value E[ ˆΘ] returns Θ and
all errors disappear. The bound for the variance of an
unbiased estimator is set by the Cramer-Rao inequality

Where F (Θ) is the Fisher information of a measure-
ment. The Fisher information coincides with the second
moment of the classical logarithmic derivative of the like-
lihood function. For N number of measurements of iden-
tically prepared quantum states, the total Fisher infor-
mation is the sum of all individual Fisher informations.
Therefore, this implies that the variance of a parameter
scales as
N F (Θ) . The Fisher information F (Θ) is fur-
ther bounded by the Quantum Fisher information H(Θ)
which signiﬁes the most precise measurement allowed by
quantum mechanics. Similarly, the QFI is additive and
for N measurements we have the bound:

The general problem we wish to address in this section
is to determine the Cramer-Rao bound for the beamsplit-
ter parameter Θ if the probe states initially evolve under
a lossy quantum channel given by a known transmission
t. We represent the situation diagrammatically in Fig. 1.
It is always possible to decompose the lossy channels into
orthogonal modes. We begin by introducing an auxiliary
mode and treating the loss and parameter estimator as
two beamsplitters with transmissions t and Θ.

We consider the beamsplitter transformations,

Where ˆain is Alice’s input mode and ˆb is the mode
Bob receives. The auxiliary modes are ˆcout and ˆdout.
Our goal is to determine an appropriate probe state for
ˆain that maximises the QFI under the evolution of the
lossy quantum channel. The QFI can be written as the
symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) deﬁned as a Her-
mitian operator that has the form [9]:

dˆρΘ
dΘ

=

2

[ˆρΘ ˆΛ(Θ) + ˆΛ(Θ)ˆρΘ]

(5)

Where ˆΛ(Θ) is an optimal system observable with an
expectation value T r[ˆΛ(Θ)ˆρΘ] = 0, and ρΘ is the density
operator describing the output state of the probe.
In
order to determine the QFI, we can evaluate the operator
Λ(Θ) and thus H(Θ) = T r[ˆΛ2(Θ)ˆρΘ] as done in Ref [9].
However, we consider a more practical and succinct
approach to determine the QFI that is useful if the addi-
tional known loss parameter t is introduced and the probe
state is Gaussian. We assume that t is completely char-
acterised beforehand. The representation of this lossy
quantum channel in Fig. 1 consists of a two beamsplitter
setup with t and Θ corresponding to the transmissions. A
pure Gaussian probe state passes through a lossy channel
of transmission t represented by the probe state evolving
under the unitary beamsplitter operator UBSt. The sub-
sequent ‘lossy probe state’ will be used to measure the
beamsplitter parameter Θ of the unitary operator UBSΘ.
To determine the QFI, we begin from the geometry of
two density matrices. The Bures distance is the minimal
distance between puriﬁcations of two density matrices ρ
and σ:

dB(ρ, σ) = [2(1 −(cid:112)F(ρ, σ)]

Where F(ρ, σ) is the quantum ﬁdelity:

(cid:113)√

F = (T r(

(7)

The quantum ﬁdelity or Uhlmann’s transition proba-
bility is a well known quantiﬁcation [11] for the similarity
of quantum states. The Bures distance can be related to
the quantum Fisher information via:

8(1 −(cid:112)F(ρΘ, ρΘ+dΘ))

H(Θ) = lim
dΘ→0

dΘ2

(8)

For pure states, the ﬁdelity reduces to the overlap
of the initial and ﬁnal states F = |(cid:104)ψ|ψ(cid:48)(cid:105)|2. For a
general Gaussian state of any mixedness, the ﬁdelity
can be expressed in terms of the quadrature variances
V + = (cid:104)∆X(φ)2(cid:105) and V − = (cid:104)∆P (φ)2(cid:105), where X = a + a†
and P = −i(a− a†). The variances V ± are directly mea-
surable values. We wish to determine the ﬁnal quadra-
ture variances of the evolved state V ±
for a parameter

value Θ, and the variance V ±
2 for an inﬁnitesimal change
Θ+dΘ. The ﬁdelity can be expressed in the form [11–13]:

F = F(φs)D(x)

(9)

φs is the angle between the two states. We assume that
for the rest of this paper that this is unchanged φs = 0.
F at φs = 0 can be expressed in terms of the quadrature
variances V1 and V2:

We make use of the deﬁnition in equation 8 and the bi-
1 − x ≈ 1− x/2. Finally,

We note that for room temperature T = 300 K and

number occupation ˜nT h is negligible. Thus, the QFI can
be approximated to that of an attenuated coherent state:

In addition, if the two states are separated by xr + ixi

in phase space, a factor D(x) is introduced:

B. Squeezed Coherent probe state

A. Coherent probe state with thermal noise

We can use these expressions to determine the QFI for
a coherent probe state with a mixed thermal state in the
auxiliary mode ˆc. The variances of the quadratures are
obtained from the Heisenberg picture. The variances add
as follows (cid:104)(∆Xout)2(cid:105) = t2 (cid:104)(∆Xin)2(cid:105) + (1− t2)(cid:104)(∆Xc)2(cid:105)
and (cid:104)(∆Xb)2(cid:105) = Θ2 (cid:104)(∆Xout)2(cid:105) + (1 − Θ2)(cid:104)(∆Xd)2(cid:105). A
thermal state has variance (cid:104)(∆Xc)2(cid:105) = 2˜nT h + 1 and
(cid:104)(∆Xd)2(cid:105) = 1 is the vacuum state. Hence

1 = 2˜nT hΘ2(1 − t2) + 1
V +

(12)

Where ˜nT h is the Planck thermal distribution function.
Thus for a slight variation in the parameter Θ + dΘ, the
variance is:

1 + 4˜nT hΘdΘ(1 − t2) + 2˜nT hdΘ2(1 − t2) (13)

1 = V +

1 = V1 and V −

(15)

We now consider a squeezed coherent probe state. We
assume the auxiliary vacuum states in either beamsplit-
ters have variance ∆Xc = ∆Xd = 1. A squeezed coherent
state can have a quadrature variance that is better than
the shot noise (cid:104)(∆Xin)2(cid:105) = e−2r and (cid:104)(∆Pin)2(cid:105) = e2r.
The level of squeezing is determined by the parameter r
where we have assumed the maximum squeezing without
loss of generality is in the X quadrature. We note that
the squeezing parameter r, the magnitude |α| and the
angle θ of the coherent state are the only relevant param-
eters Thus, the variances of the evolved state are V +
1 =
1 = Θ2t2(e2r − 1) + 1. Since we
Θ2t2(e−2r − 1) + 1 and V −
are estimating how well a change in Θ can be detected,
the second state is the same state with an inﬁnitesimal
shift in the parameter Θ + dΘ. In phase space, the sep-
aration is given by xr + ixi = dΘt(cos(θ) + i sin(θ))|α|.
We approximate the ﬁdelity expression to second order
in dΘ and disregarded any higher orders.

The ﬁdelity for the squeezed coherent state is:

to use a large fraction of squeezed photons. The parameter

for each t. The parameter is Θ = 1 − x ≈ 1 − 1.0 × 10−3

We restrict the pure Gaussian probe state to ﬁnite en-

optimize H(Θ) over the squeezed fraction y = sinh2 r/˜n.
We note that the squeezing parameter r and the ampli-
tude α are the only relevant parameters.

An estimate for Θ is needed because H(Θ) explicitly
depends on the parameter we are estimating. We will

maximum information if Θ is near unity. For the ideal
case where t = 1, the Quantum Fisher Information im-
proves with more squeezing for a low number of pho-
tons as seen in ﬁgure 2. For ˜n ≥ 100, a large fraction
of squeezed photons becomes less advantageous and it
would be ineﬃcient to squeeze all photons.

For less than ideal transmission, there is a tendency
for the maximum QFI to occur for small fractions of
squeezing.
In ﬁgures 3, 4 and 5, the Quantum Fisher
Information is shown for three mean photon numbers
˜n = 1, 10 and 100 and transmission coeﬃcient t ranging
from t = 0 to t = 1.00. For a small number of photons
˜n = 1 to ˜n = 10 and low transmission, the squeezing
does not aﬀect the information. For high transmission,
the maximum information occurs for a large fraction of
squeezed photons. However, for increasing number of
photons ˜n ≥ 100 (see Fig. 5), this maximum is attained
for a smaller fraction of squeezing until squeezing be-
comes irrelevant and fully coherent photons are the most
advantageous for all levels of loss. Furthermore, for very
lossy transmission, we observed that the maximum QFI
occurs for a ﬁnite fraction of squeezed photons. Nonethe-
less, fully coherent probe states diﬀer negligibly from the
maximum QFI of these lossy channels.

Now that we’ve fully characterized the QFI of a lossy
quantum channel, we can apply the results to the mea-
surement of space-time parameters.

III. ESTIMATING SPACE-TIME PARAMETERS

In this section, we will use the previously outlined
model to estimate the space-time curvature using a lossy
quantum channel. The probe state sent by Alice from
Earth’s surface will experience attenuation both due to
scattering by the atmosphere but also from diﬀraction
of the beam as it propagates to Bob. We will begin by
presenting an approximate model for wave packets prop-
agating in Earth’s space-time as derived in Ref [10].

Earth’s space-time can be approximated to be a non-
rotating spherical body in the (1 + 1)- dimensional
Schwarzschild metric if we assume Bob is geostationary.
Therefore, the angular momentum is negligible because
Alice and Bob are radially aligned. Disregarding the
angular coordinates, the reduced Schwarzschild line el-
ement is ds2 = gµνdxµdxν = −f (r)dt2 + 1
f (r) dr2 where
f (r) = 1 − rs/r and rs = 2GM
is Earth’s Schwarzschild
radius [18, 19]. An observer at radius r = r0 in this met-

ric will measure the proper time τ = (cid:82) ds = (cid:112)f (r0)t

c2

where t is the proper time as measured by an observer at
inﬁnite distance r = ∞.

The electromagnetic ﬁeld of a photon can be described
by a bosonic massless scalar ﬁeld and Klein-Gordon
equation (cid:3)Φ = 0 where the d’Alambertian is given by
√−g∂µ [24]. Using the Eddington-Finkelstein co-
1√−g ∂µ
ordinates as done in Ref [10], the solutions of this equa-

tion are given by outgoing u = ct − (r + rs log | r
and v = ct + (r + rs log | r

low geodesics [18, 19]. It it straightforward to show that
the ﬁeld operator Φ is expressed as the combination of
bosonic annihilation and creation operators of these out-
going and ingoing waves:

formally equivalent to a beamsplitter with transmission
parameter Θ. To implement this scheme, Bob would
have to employ a mode selective beamsplitter transfor-
mation that extracts the desired mode [25]. In Appendix
A, we outline a method for a mode splitter using linear
optics such that the commutation relation [a, a(cid:48)†] = Θ
holds, and Bob eﬀectively implements a beamsplitter
with transmission Θ.

Thus the eﬀective beamsplitter ratio is characterised
by the overlap of the frequency distributions sent by Alice
and received by Bob. Or equivalently, the commutation
relation of the annihilation and creation operators is no
longer normalized.

Since the source is not monochromatic, we need a

with a spread of σ [26]. We derive a general expression
for the overlap between Alice’s transformed wavepacket
and Bob’s arbitrary choice of the Gaussian shape. For
the latter, we denote Bob’s detector centre frequency as
bω0 and the frequency spread cσ0. By using equations 21
and 22, the overlap Θ for this case is given by:

disregard the height corrections due to the geodesic in
Schwarzcshild space-time since these are on the order of

Since Θ is equivalent to the beamsplitter transmission
parameter, we can use the Quantum Fisher Information
found in equation 19 to determine the Cramer-Rao bound
and in particular we can incorporate the loss of the probe
beam. However, to estimate the Schwarzschild parame-
ter rs, we must determine the corresponding Quantum
Fisher informations. From the deﬁnition of ﬁdelity, this
only requires the application of the chain rule such that

Let us explore some properties of this equation. From
Eq. 27 and the Quantum Fisher information of a co-
herent state H(Θ) = |tα|2, we can see that as t → 1
and Θ → 1 which corresponds to  → δ + ∆2
, the
variance diverges and it is impossible to measure the
Schwarzschild radius rs with coherent states around the
point Θ = 1. However, if the probe energy is completely
squeezed, then the denominator reduces to:

It is evident that coherent states do not contribute
to the error bound if Θ = 1 and Bob matches up his
wavepacket with the one he receives δ = . Squeezing is
absolutely necessary to detect the small deviation from
Θ = 1. As seen in Fig. 6, if the overlap is Θ = 1 − 3 ×
10−10, the error of rs is far too large for lossy channels.
The only exception is when t = 1 which depends strongly
on the amount of squeezing.

However,

if Bob’s detector is using Alice’s original
wavepacket  = 0 then the error bound for coherent states
is sensible:

(30)

And no squeezing is necessary. Furthermore, we deter-
mine the optimal  for which the coherent state is most
advantageous. We simply minimize 27 with respect to 
to obtain opt = δ − 2σ
2 . The rs lower error
ω0
bound for t = 1 is thus:

and xopt = 1

As seen in Fig. 7, the lossy channels now have reason-
able error bounds. Finally, we can determine the optimal
 for a given squeezing fraction and transmission as seen
in Fig. 8. In ﬁgure 8, ∆rs
is plotted against the fraction
rs
of squeezed photons for ˜n = 2 average photons of the
initial probe state. For low transmission t, the minimum
error occurs for a small fraction of squeezing that is less
than 10%. Therefore, it is more advantageous to use co-
herent photons for heavily attenuated signals. However,
for almost perfect transmission, it is considerably more
advantageous to squeeze 100% of the photons.

In contrast to Ref.

In ﬁgures 6 to 15 we adopt parameters similar to Ref.
[10]. We assume that Alice is on the surface of Earth
rA = 6.37 × 106m and Bob is in geostationary orbit
rB = 42.0 × 106 m. With these parameters, we obtain
δ = 6.0 × 10−10.
[10], we relate
the number of measurements N per second to the fre-
quency width σ = 2 kHz. We assume that the length
of the pulse is ∆t = 1/σ = 0.5 ms and thus within
one second, we can have up to 103 measurements. For
minimal correlation between pulses, we assume that one
pulse has 50 milliseconds of space, and as a rule of thumb
N = σ/10 = 2 × 102 measurements. Counterintuitively,
by making the width of σ smaller and thus the number
of measurements smaller, we ﬁnd rs is more precise.

It is apparent that the overlap between Alice’s and
Bob’s Gaussian wavepackets is very near unity. However,

it is known that Gaussian wave-packets are the best at
maintaining their overlap given a displacement [27]. This
means they are least optimal for our purposes. We re-
quire a frequency proﬁle that is more sensitive. Hence,
we consider a rectangular frequency proﬁle. In the time-
domain, this would correspond to a sinc(kt) function.

For a normalised rectangular function of width σ0
and height 1/

the overlap with the transformed rectangular function in
Bob’s reference frame. From equation 21, Bob measures

have lower frequency and smaller overall width but larger
height. Thus, making use of equation 22, the overlap is:

This indicates that the bound can approach 0 up to an

For example, if Bob’s detector guesses the correct distri-
bution within (δ − )ω = 1 Hz then a perfect channel
would have 10−6 precision. As seen in Fig. 10, squeezing
is clearly advantageous. In comparison to the best Gaus-
sian precision, the rectangular frequency proﬁle does 2
orders of magnitude better.

There is no deﬁnite form of this integral. However,
we can make some approximations since a = 1 − δ and
b = 1 −  where δ and  are very small. We also can sup-
pose that the bounds of the integral are very close to the
central frequency ω0 with the bounds extending over a
region of σ across the central frequency. For the choice of
∆ = 0.1 and ∆ = 0.01, the overlap of the latter is approx-
imately rectangular as seen in Fig. 12. Furthermore, the
overlap as a function of δ is continuous at the point δ = 
and the derivative with respect to rs exists in contrast to
the ideal rectangular frequency proﬁle. Approaching δ−
from below has the same minimum as approaching from
above (as seen in Fig. 14) since the frequency proﬁle is
symmetric. For the larger ∆ = 0.1, the same behaviour
occurs but the relative error of rs is larger than for the
case of ∆ = 0.01.

In Fig. 15, we present the Schwarzschild radius lower
error bound optimized for each squeezing fraction y and
transmission parameter t. Using the Θ in Fig. 13 we

respect to the shot noise quadrature variance. Squeezing has
little eﬀect on the lossy channels. (Parameters: (δ−opt)ω0 =
2σ Hz and all other parameters the same as Fig. 12)

B. Large coherent pulses with small squeezing

For large scale interferometers such as GEO and
the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observa-
tory (LIGO),
it has been shown that large coherent
sources of light with additional squeezing can signiﬁ-
cantly improve the detector sensitivity [30].

For the Gaussian frequency proﬁle, operating at the
optimal point xopt = 1/2 requires large coherent states
rather than squeezed states. As seen in Fig. 16, the
addition of squeezing does not signiﬁcantly improve the
precision.

Conversely, for the rectangular frequency distribution,
squeezing signiﬁcantly improves the precision. As seen
in Fig. 17, for good transmission coeﬃcients, squeezing
increases the precision up to a factor 10 for 17.4 dB of
squeezing. Current state-of-art technologies have been
able to achieve squeezing of up to 12.7 dB [31]. In both
cases, the error improves with additional coherent pho-
tons.

FIG. 17: As in Fig. 16 but for ∆ = 0.01 rectangular fre-
quency proﬁle at the optimal operating point Θ = 0.999 with
˜n = 1000. For almost no loss, squeezing improves the error
bound up to a factor of 5 × 10−1 for 17.4 dB of squeezing.

with additional squeezing of 10 dB (dashed lines). With
10 dB of squeezing, if Bob’s distance is exactly at the
Rayleigh length, the error is of the same order as the
minima at L ≈ 105 m. Nonetheless, the best situation
is when zR = 103 m corresponding to a beam width of
w0 = 1.4 cm which has a minimum error of 10−1 between
L = 104 m and L = 106 m. Squeezing has no eﬀect on
this minimum because the signal is heavily attenuated at
Bob’s location. For the Gaussian frequency proﬁle, the
best relative error is rather poor. We now present the
tanh rectangular frequency proﬁle as an alternative to
this resource intensive scheme.

Now consider the red curves in Fig. 18, which report
the relative error for the same parameters using a rectan-
gular frequency proﬁle with ∆ = 0.001. We immediately
note for the squeezed coherent probe state that there
are no minima at any location. The minimum occurs at
the Rayleigh lengths (where t = 1) with an impressive
1 order of magnitude improvement in precision over the
Gaussian frequency proﬁle. Thus, it is now possible to
measure the Schwarzschild radius with excellent preci-
sion with Bob at the Rayleigh lengths L = zR = 100 m
and L = zR = 1000 m to achieve 10−1 and 10−2 relative
error respectively. We note that squeezing has a signif-
icant eﬀect at the Rayleigh length because Θ ≈ 1 since
L is small and the transmission coeﬃcient is t = 1. In
this regime, squeezing becomes important. We observe
that the precision increases up to a factor of 5× 10−1 for
both Rayleigh lengths with the added 10 dB of squeez-
ing. However, for fully coherent photons, the minima
are recovered and occur at approximately L = 105 m.
Therefore, a ∆ = 0.001 rectangular frequency proﬁle
works well for short distances and are always up to 10
times more precise than Gaussian proﬁles of the same
frequency spread.

D. Measurement basis of rs

In our derivation, the Bures distance deﬁnition of the
QFI assumes a Gaussian measurement basis. To deter-
mine the measurement basis, we refer back to the def-
inition of the QFI used by Ref [9]. The eigenspace of
ˆΛ(Θ) represents the optimal measurement for which the
Fisher information is maximised. We note that the mea-
surement strategy in Ref [15] takes this into account and
a one-step adaptive strategy is proposed.
In the ﬁrst
step, one makes a fraction of the total measurements N ξ
where 1/2 < ξ < 1 and provides an estimate for the pa-
rameter Θ0. Consequently, the eigenspace ˆΛ(Θ0) can be
built from the knowledge of Θ0 and used to make a better
estimate on the remaining measurements.

In Ref [9], it has been proven that the optimal measure-
ment for the beamsplitter parameter using a pure Gaus-
sian probe state is of the form D(α)S(r)S†(η)D(β)|n(cid:105).

ent photons with no squeezing, and the dashed lines have an

ω0 = 700 THz and hence δ = 6.0 × 10−10)

C. Optimal position of Bob

Up to this point we have assumed that Bob is located
in a geo-stationary orbit and that diﬀerent levels of loss
can be achieved. We consider a more realistic scenario
in which the loss is a function of how high Bob is and
investigate the position of Bob for which the relative
Schwarzschild radius error is minimal. We model the
attenuation with distance of the Gaussian beam using
the characteristic Rayleigh length deﬁned by zR = πw2
where w0 is the width of the beam and λ is the centre
wavelength [32]. The initial position of Bob corresponds
to the position of the Rayleigh length and we assume that
the detector has a width
2w0 which captures all the in-
tensity. Therefore, the transmission coeﬃcient t = 1 at
this point. Away from the Rayleigh length, the transmis-
sion decreases with distance L as:

surement bases for the beamsplitter parameter using a
lossy probe state are Gaussian operations and photon
counting [9].

VI. CONCLUSION

We have studied the optimal estimation of the beam-
splitter parameter using a Gaussian quantum probe that
is mixed due to loss. We determined the relevant Quan-
tum Fisher informations using the deﬁnition of the Bu-
res distance and an expression for the ﬁdelity in terms of
the quadrature variances. Using this convenient expres-
sion, we’ve considered a squeezed coherent probe state
prepared by Alice. We have optimized the QFI with re-
spect to the squeezing fraction and found that for very
lossy probe states or low beamsplitter transmission, co-
herent states are more favourable. However, for low loss
and high beamsplitter transmission, squeezing the pho-
tons is more advantageous. We’ve applied these results to
a situation where loss is inevitable. In particular we’ve
studied the use of a lossy probe state to estimate the
Schwarzschild radius rs of Earth. We’ve shown that the

frequency proﬁle of the modes sent by Alice is important.
By identifying the optimal point that Bob can choose to
achieve the best precision, we determined that an approx-
imate rectangular frequency proﬁle achieves error bounds
an order of magnitude better than a Gaussian. We also
considered more realistic scenarios in which the transmis-
sion coeﬃcient depends on the distance from the source
and found that approximate rectangular mode shapes are
better overall.

The current analysis is restricted to Gaussian states.
Other non-classical probe states such as NOON and en-
tangled coherent states (ECS) may enhance the precision
even further. Also, the current analysis assumes a spe-
ciﬁc protocol for estimating rs. A comparison with other
strategies would be interesting.

Appendix A: Mode Splitter

Consider that we have an input mode that can be writ-

ten:

√

a(cid:48) =

√

1 −  a(cid:48)(cid:48)

 a +

(A1)
For our purposes the mode a(cid:48) can be considered the mode
that Alice sent, as it appears when it reaches Bob, whilst
a is the mode that Bob expects. The mode a(cid:48)(cid:48) is the
unmatched part which has the property [a, a(cid:48)(cid:48)†] = 0. Now
Bob applies a mode sensitive beamsplitter described by
the unitary:

U = exp iθ(ab† + ba†)

(A2)

This looks like a normal beamsplitter but it isn’t because
it only acts speciﬁcally on the modes a and b (where the
vacuum mode entering the other beamsplitter port can
be assumed to be in the mode b without loss of general-
ity). The transfer functions for the modes through the
beamsplitter can be written, for the transmitted beam:

η a +(cid:112)1 − η b) +

√

√

√
(

1 −  a(cid:48)(cid:48)

(A3)

a(cid:48)
T =
√

where

η b
√
 a(cid:48) +
1 −  a − √
√

√

η = cos θ. For the reﬂected beam:
a(cid:48)

R = (cid:112)1 − η a − √
= (cid:112)1 − η(

1 −  v(cid:48)) − √

√

η b

(A4)

where in the second line we have introduced a vacuum
mode deﬁned as v(cid:48) =
 a(cid:48)(cid:48). Notice if we set
θ = π/2 and hence η = 0 we get the transformation we
desire, i.e. a(cid:48)

1 −  v(cid:48) where

 = [a, a(cid:48)†].

 a(cid:48) +

√

√

R =

One way to implement the mode-sensitive beamsplitter

of Eq. 2 is described in Ref [25].
