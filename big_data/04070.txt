A SUPER-EDDINGTON, COMPTON-THICK WIND IN GRO J1655–40?

Draft version March 15, 2016

ABSTRACT

During its 2005 outburst, GRO J1655-40 was observed at high spectral resolution with the Chandra
HETGS, revealing a spectrum rich with blueshifted absorption lines indicative of an accretion disk
wind – apparently too hot, too dense, and too close to the black hole to be driven by radiation pres-
sure or thermal pressure (Miller et al.). But this exotic wind represents just one piece of the puzzle
in this outburst, as its presence coincides with an extremely soft and curved X-ray continuum spec-
trum, remarkable X-ray variability (Uttley & Klein-Wolt), and a bright, unexpected optical/infrared
blackbody component that varies on the orbital period. Focusing on the X-ray continuum and the
optical/infrared/UV spectral energy distribution, we argue that the unusual features of this “hyper-
soft state” are natural consequences of a super-Eddington Compton-thick wind from the disk: the
optical/infrared blackbody represents the cool photosphere of a dense, extended outﬂow, while the
X-ray emission is explained as Compton scattering by the relatively cool, optically thick wind. This
wind obscures the intrinsic luminosity of the inner disk, which we suggest may have been at or above
the Eddington limit.

1. INTRODUCTION

In outburst, accreting stellar-mass black holes exhibit
an extraordinary variety of timing and spectral behav-
iors, commonly referred to as “states” (see Homan & Bel-
loni 2005; Remillard & McClintock 2006 and references
therein). While these states are readily distinguished
by their X-ray properties alone, much of what we know
about them comes from simultaneous or contemporane-
ous radio observations (so much so that their progression
in black hole outbursts is often referred to as the “disk-
jet connection” or “disk-jet coupling;” Fender et al. 2004,
2009 and references therein).

Brieﬂy, in the canonical picture, black hole transients
emerge from quiescence in spectrally hard states with ﬂat
or inverted radio spectra (i.e., indicative of self-absorbed
compact jets; Corbel et al. 2000; Fender 2001; Fender
et al. 2004, 2009). Here, the synchrotron break is usu-
ally found between the mid-infrared and optical (Rahoui
et al. 2011; Gandhi et al. 2011; Corbel & Fender 2002;
Hynes et al. 2003; Buxton & Bailyn 2004; Homan et al.
2005; Russell et al. 2006; Coriat et al. 2009).
In this
state, the accretion ﬂow is generally understood to be
radiatively ineﬃcient (Esin et al. 1997), and the X-ray
emission may include optically thin synchrotron emis-
sion from the jet (e.g., Markoﬀ et al. 2001; Homan et al.
2005; Russell et al. 2010) or emission Compton scattered
by a corona of hot electrons, which may be the base of
the compact jet (Markoﬀ et al. 2005).

For a period of days to weeks, the radio and X-ray lu-

the radio/X-ray correlation, which is actually the low-
mass end of the Fundamental Plane of black hole activ-
ity; Hannikainen et al. 1998; Corbel et al. 2000, 2003;
Gallo et al. 2003; Merloni et al. 2003; Falcke et al. 2004;
K¨ording et al. 2006; Gallo et al. 2006; G¨ultekin et al.
2009). The optical and infrared emission shows a strong,
similar correlation, conﬁrming its association with the
compact jet (Russell et al. 2006). Due to the increasing
number of outliers, the exact nature of the correlation
between LR and LX has been a subject of intense eﬀort
in the last several years; it is now clear that there are
not one but at least two tracks in LR − LX space, with
some sources able to switch tracks within and between
outbursts (Coriat et al. 2011; Gallo et al. 2012; Corbel
et al. 2013 and references therein).

Eventually, on reaching a few percent of the Edding-
ton luminosity LEdd (e.g., Maccarone 2003), the sys-
tems undergo a state transition in which the X-ray spec-
tral hardness and rms variability decrease signiﬁcantly
(Homan & Belloni 2005; Remillard & McClintock 2006;
Mu˜noz-Darias et al. 2011; Motta et al. 2012 and refer-
ences therein), and the synchrotron emission from the
compact jet is deeply quenched after a major optically-
thin radio ﬂare (Tananbaum et al. 1972; Gallo et al. 2003;
Homan et al. 2005; Russell et al. 2007; Fender et al. 2009).
During the softer states, the X-ray emission is typically
dominated by a multitemperature blackbody from a thin
accretion disk (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973; Mitsuda et al.
1984; McClintock & Remillard 2006; Remillard & Mc-
Clintock 2006; Belloni 2010b; Steiner et al. 2009). After
some time the spectrum hardens and the jet reactivates
before the return to quiescence (Fender et al. 1999; Cor-
bel et al. 2000; Corbel & Fender 2002; Gallo et al. 2003;
Fender et al. 2009).

Yet it appears that even the detailed characterizations
of the evolution of black hole variability, spectral energy
distributions (SEDs), and jets described above do not
capture the entirety of accretion and ejection processes

around stellar-mass black holes in outburst. Perhaps the
most signiﬁcant of recent additions to the uniﬁed picture
is the accretion disk wind, a highly-ionized outﬂow that
may be launched from the disk by an combination of
radiation pressure, thermal pressure, and magnetic pro-
cesses (e.g., Blandford & Payne 1982; Begelman et al.
1983; Woods et al. 1996; Proga 2000; Proga & Kallman
2002; Proga 2003). In the last 20 years, a number of such
absorbers have been detected around stellar-mass black
holes (Ebisawa 1997; Lee et al. 2002; Miller et al. 2006,
2008; Neilsen & Lee 2009; Ueda et al. 2009; Neilsen et al.
2011, 2012; Neilsen & Homan 2012; King et al. 2012;

Ponti et al. 2012; Neilsen 2013; King et al. 2014; Neilsen
et al. 2014; D´ıaz Trigo et al. 2014; see D´ıaz Trigo & Boirin
2013 for a discussion of similar absorbers in neutron star
systems). These outﬂows are signiﬁcant for two reasons
in particular: (1) they can carry away the vast majority
of the infalling gas (up to ∼ 95%; Neilsen et al. 2011;
Ponti et al. 2012), thereby suppressing jets (Neilsen &
Lee 2009) and generally controlling the black hole mass
accretion rate, and (2) they are found almost universally
during spectrally soft states at moderate to high lumi-
nosity (Ponti et al. 2012). These facts leave open the
possibility that ionized winds play a major role in deter-

mining the outburst phenomenology of stellar-mass black
holes (see also King et al. 2013).

There are two notable exceptions to the absence of
winds outside spectrally soft states. The ﬁrst, GRS
1915+105 (Lee et al. 2002) is exceptional in so many
categories of black hole behavior that we will not dwell
on it further. The second is GRO J1655-40, which
was observed twice at high spectral resolution with the
Chandra High-Energy Transmission Grating Spectrome-
ter (HETGS; Canizares et al. 2005) during its 2005 out-
burst. The ﬁrst of these observations took place toward
the end of a spectrally hard state and showed a single
Fe xxvi absorption line at 7 keV (Miller et al. 2008;
Neilsen & Homan 2012). The second observation, 20
days later, revealed a multitude of absorption lines from
O to Ni, indicative of an extremely dense, highly-ionized
wind that could not reasonably be launched by ther-
mal or radiation pressure (leaving magnetic processes as
the only plausible explanation; Miller et al. 2006; Net-
zer 2006; Miller et al. 2008; Kallman et al. 2009; Luketic
et al. 2010). Little is known about the exact origin of
the wind or what causes some winds to be launched by
Compton heating and others by magnetic ﬁelds, but to
date, the richness of this spectrum and the extreme prop-
erties (i.e., density, column density) of the wind are un-
rivaled in stellar-mass black holes.

In this paper, we report on the discovery of another
exceptional property of the dense, magnetically-driven
wind in GRO J1655–40: it appears to be associated with
an optical/infrared (OIR) excess that is consistent with
a ∼ 7000 K blackbody emitter. During the 2005 out-
burst, Buxton & Bailyn (2005) reported from SMARTS
observations that the source remained steady in the OIR
for at least 40 days. Here, we argue that this bright OIR
plateau (Figure 1) cannot be explained either in the con-
text of the disk-jet coupling described above or by any
phenomena related to the companion star, and that it
implies that the wind is actually Compton thick. If this
OIR excess can indeed be associated with the wind, it
provides a highly promising diagnostic for the presence
of such winds for future observational campaigns. In Sec-
tion 2 we describe the observations and data reduction.
In Section 3 we present the multiwavelength light curves
of GRO J1655–40, and we perform some modeling of the
OIR SED in Section 4. We discuss and summarize our
results in Section 5.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

In the following, we adopt a black hole mass MBH =
6.3 ± 0.5 M⊙, a primary to secondary mass ratio Q =
2.6 ± 0.3, an orbital period P = 2.62168 ± 0.00014 days,
and an inclination i = 70.2 ± 1.9 (van der Hooft et al.
1998; Greene et al. 2001). The distance to the source is
controversial: it was reported to be DBH = 3.2 ± 0.2 kpc
(Hjellming & Rupen 1995), but also argued to be lower
than 1.7 kpc (Foellmi et al. 2006). The ISM extinction
along the line-of-sight, i.e. AV = 3.6 ± 0.3, is consistent
with a distance in the range 3.2 kpc and 3.9 kpc (see the
3D modeling of the Galactic interstellar extinction, Mar-
shall et al. 2006), and we adopt 3.2 kpc for the remainder
of this paper.

2.1. RXTE

As detailed in Miller et al. (2008) and elsewhere, RXTE
made frequent pointed observations of GRO J1655–40
with the PCA during its 2005 outburst. For the purposes
of this paper, we focus on the observations taken between
∼ 2 weeks before and ∼ 2 weeks after the OIR plateau,
covering the appearance, evolution, and disappearance
of the unusual emission state. As in Neilsen & Homan
(2012), we extract PCA spectra from the top layer of
PCU 2, which has the best calibration, using a 0.6%
systematic uncertainty in each spectral bin. Although
we extract spectra from the 3–45 keV energy band, we
require a S/N ratio of at least three in each bin, which
eﬀectively limits the softest spectra to below 20 −25 keV.

2.2. SMARTS

As reported by Buxton et al. (2005); Buxton & Bailyn
(2005), GRO J1655−40 was observed frequently through-
out the 2005 outburst with ANDICAM (DePoy et al.
2003) on CTIO’s 1.3 m telescope. Observations were
made in B, V , I, J, and K, and the details of the data
reduction are presented in Migliari et al. (2007).

2.3. SWIFT

Between March 6 2005 and October 25 2005,
GRO J1655−40 was observed at several epochs with the
Swift (Gehrels et al. 2004) satellite. The dataset used
in this study, which is already reported in Brocksopp
et al. (2006), consists of 20 observations with the Ultra-
Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT, Roming et al. 2005) in
at least one of the following ﬁlters, uvw2, uvm2, uvw1,
u, b, and v. Exposure times were set between 200 s and
7800 s. We re-analyzed the data and we produced an
image in each available band with uvotimsum. We then
used uvotsource to extract the source and the back-
ground counts in 5′′and 15′′ circular apertures, respec-
tively; the derived GRO J1655−40 magnitudes are listed
in Table 1.

3. LIGHTCURVES

The full X-ray/OIR monitoring of the 2005 outburst
is shown in Figure 1 (the X-ray outburst proﬁle was pre-
viously presented by Miller et al. 2008). As expected in
the canonical picture of black hole outbursts (e.g., Fender
et al. 2004; Remillard & McClintock 2006; Fender et al.
2009; Belloni 2010b), GRO J1655-40 rose in luminosity
in a spectrally hard state. A sharp transition to a bright,
spectrally soft state is visible around MJD 53440 in the
X-ray ﬂux, hardness, and RMS variability. Although this
state does not actually produce the softest X-ray emis-
sion during the outburst, its similarity to a ‘hypersoft’
state in Cyg X-3 led Uttley & Klein-Wolt (2015) to ap-
ply the same label; we adopt this term for the remainder
of the paper. While the count rate of the hypersoft state
rises slowly over the next ∼ 50 days, its spectral hardness
and fractional RMS variability remain steady.

While the X-ray emission at ﬁrst glance appears fairly
typical of black hole outbursts, the OIR lightcurve is un-
usual. In spectrally hard states, this emission is normally
associated with the jet (e.g., Russell et al. 2006; Migliari
et al. 2007; Russell et al. 2010; Rahoui et al. 2011 and
references therein) and is expected to be quenched along
with the jet during the transition to a brighter, softer
state (Homan et al. 2005). But in this outburst, the OIR

ﬂux level with recurrent dips. Indeed, the plateau ﬂuxes
(here deﬁned as MJD 53459 – 53499) exhibit an oscil-
lation with a fractional rms variability of ∼ 10% at all
wavelengths when folded on the orbital period of van
der Hooft et al. (1998)1. The oscillation is shown in the
normalized, phase-folded BV IJK light curves in Figure
2; two cycles are shown for clarity. The orbital proﬁle
is very similar at all wavelengths: a smooth oscillation
with a broad maximum between 0.5 and 0.9, with a min-
imum around phase 0.1 and a few dips that are deeper
at shorter wavelengths (and may therefore be unrelated
to the smooth oscillation). Due to the large number of
orbits completed since the van der Hooft et al. (1998)
reference point (∼ 1, 395), the phases quoted here are
sensitive to the orbital period, with a systematic uncer-
tainty of roughly 0.1-0.2 in phase. To determine robust
phases, it may be necessary to use the SMARTS data to
reﬁne the orbital period.

To verify the statistical signiﬁcance of this oscillation,
we performed an epoch-folding analysis (Davies 1990)
using S-Lang/ISIS Timing Analysis Routines2 (SITAR).
First, we consider each wavelength independently, fold-
ing the plateau light curve using 50 evenly spaced trial
periods from 1 to 10 days and 5 phase bins in the folded
light curve. The resulting L statistics show a noticeable
peak at roughly the orbital period Porb, as well as at
2Porb and 3Porb, lending credence to the idea that this is
truly an oscillation related to the orbital period of GRO
J1655-40.

Complicating this interpretation are the observational
errors, which are not accounted for by the epoch folding
routine: while the oscillation is most signiﬁcant in B and
V band light curves (with implied single-trial signiﬁcance
levels of & 10−5), these bands also have the largest obser-
vational errors. But while we may not have the statistics
to measure the oscillation period independently from the
plateau data, the L statistic is ideal for conﬁrming peri-
odicities (Davies 1990), so we can focus on epoch folding
at the known orbital period. In order to incorporate the
sizable observational errors, we exploit the similarity of
the oscillation proﬁle at all wavelengths using a weighted

lengths. There is a deep minimum at phase ∼ 0 that is deeper at
shorter wavelengths.

emission rises after the transition to the hypersoft state,
reaching as much as 5 − 10 times its pre-transition level.
This excess is clearly visible in the 2005 April 6 spec-
tral energy distribution (SED) shown by Migliari et al.
(2007), who noted that it was consistent with a black-
body but focused on other portions of the outburst. As
with the integrated timing properties noted in the pre-
ceding paragraph (see also Uttley & Klein-Wolt 2015),
the OIR excess emission is generally steady throughout
the hypersoft state; it also appears to be uncorrelated
with the X-ray ﬂux.

3.1. Orbital Variability

In the course of inspecting the OIR plateau, we no-
ticed that the scatter in the BV IJK light curves ap-
pears to be potentially periodic, reminiscent of a steady

mean of the normalized ﬂuxes from each day during the
plateau. More speciﬁcally, we divide each of the BV IJK
time series by its respective mean and then compute daily
weighted averages and standard deviations, with weights
given by the inverse squared error on the daily ﬂuxes.
For 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations, we sample the obser-
vational errors and calculate the L statistic at the orbital
period. The average L statistic corresponds to a detec-
tion at 99.68% conﬁdence, i.e., just below 3σ. For slightly
diﬀerent periods (e.g., 2.62191 d as determined by Greene
et al. 2001) we ﬁnd signiﬁcance levels just above 3σ. Thus
it appears that the OIR plateau is modulated on (or near)
the orbital period with an rms amplitude of about 10%.
No modulation is detectable in the X-ray emission.

4. SPECTROSCOPY

4.1. Spectral energy distributions

To understand the origin of the low-energy emis-
sion throughout the hypersoft state, we model the
GRO J1655−40 UV to near-IR SEDs. We built them
using UVOT and SMARTS photometry, based on the
following three criteria: (1) the observations took place
in the soft or hypersoft states, which rules out any signif-
icant contribution from the compact jets; (2) the UVOT
and SMARTS data were quasi-simultaneous, i.e. within
a few hours of each other; and (3) GRO J1655−40 was
detected in the uw2 and/or uw1 ﬁlters to better con-
strain any emission in the UV. Seven UV to near-IR
SEDs built with data obtained between MJD 53448 and
MJD 53527 fulﬁlled these conditions, including one dur-
ing the plateau phase on MJD 53470. We corrected them
for interstellar absorption E(B − V ) = 1.2 ± 0.1 (Hynes
et al. 1998) using the extinction law given in Fitzpatrick
(1999) for a total-to-selective extinction ratio RV = 3,
the expected value along GRO J1655−40 line-of-sight
(Wegner 2003).

4.1.1. Modeling

We ﬁrst consider a combination of stellar and accre-
tion disk emission. GRO J1655−40’s companion star

was ﬁrst identiﬁed as an F3-6IV sub-giant (Orosz & Bai-
lyn 1997). This identiﬁcation was later conﬁrmed and
reﬁned to F6IV (Foellmi et al. 2006), and a signiﬁcant
stellar contribution to the optical and near-IR domain is
therefore expected.
Indeed, the B and V magnitudes
of GRO J1655−40 in quiescence are clustered around
18.7 and 17.2, respectively (Greene et al. 2001), which
is consistent with our own measurements with UVOT
at the end of the 2005 outburst (see Table 1). This is
still relatively signiﬁcant compared to the minimum B
and V magnitudes measured during the plateau phase,
i.e. around 16.4 and 15.0, respectively, and we therefore
model the UV to near-IR emission of the companion star
by scaling an F6IV Kurucz synthetic spectrum to the
extinction-corrected ﬂux densities in quiescence. X-ray
reprocessing from the inner to outer regions of the ac-
cretion disk is thought to dominate the UV emission of
microquasars in the soft state (e.g., GRS 1915+105, Ra-
houi et al. 2010; GX 339−4, Rahoui et al. 2012), so we
add a power law Fν ∝ ν1.6, consistent with irradiation.
Allowing the power law index to vary leads to ﬂatter
slopes but requires no signiﬁcant changes to our major
conclusions. Note that we did not try to use more ap-
propriate irradiated accretion disk models such as diskir
(Gierli´nski et al. 2009) – which would have allowed us to
ﬁt both high-energy and low-energy data – because, as
shown below, no direct disk emission is detected in the
X-ray band during the hypersoft state.

Due to the presence of an optical and near-infrared
excess in all SEDs, the combination of the stellar con-
tinuum and the irradiated disk results in unsatisfac-
tory ﬁts (χ2
ν = 5020.12/46 = 109.11 over all datasets).
To account for this excess, we add a spherical black-
body component, which dramatically improves the ﬁts
(χ2
ν = 36.14/32 = 1.14). But because there is a long
period (MJD 53500 - MJD 53600) with a steady opti-
cal/infrared excess unrelated to the hypersoft state, we
also consider a model that includes both this baseline
blackbody and an additional blackbody during the hy-
persoft state (see Figure 3 and Table 2 for the best-ﬁt
SEDs and parameters, respectively). While two black-

6

Neilsen et al.

bodies are not statistically required during the hypersoft
state, this model is motivated by the physical behavior
of the system (two apparent emission components in the
lightcurve), and it provides a much better ﬁt for fewer
free parameters (χ2

ν = 33.25/39 = 0.85).

4.1.2. The optical and near-infrared excess

For our initial blackbody/power law model for the IR
to UV SED of GRO J1655-40, we ﬁnd blackbody tem-
peratures ranging from 3900 K to 6500 K and radii rang-
ing from 4.1 × 1011 cm to 6.3 × 1011 cm; the power law
ﬂux dominates the UV emission (see Figure 3) at a level
of 24-100 mJy. Interestingly, the blackbody radius and
temperature in this model are strongly correlated with
the power law ﬂux (correlation coeﬃcients of 0.8 and 0.9,
respectively). The interpretation of this correlation de-
pends on the origin of the power law – we have ﬁxed the
power law index at 1.6 to simulate irradiation, but in re-
ality this is poorly constrained by our small number of
data points.

The parameters in our preferred model are fairly sim-
ilar. The baseline blackbody has a radius Rb = 4.5 ±
0.2 × 1011 cm and a temperature Tb = 4100 ± 200
K, consistent with the results presented in the previ-
ous paragraph. Meanwhile, the radius of the blackbody
excess Rex rises from (2.3 ± 0.1) × 1011 cm on MJD
53448.1 to (3.1 ± 0.2) × 1011 cm on MJD 53449.2 to
(5.2 ± 0.2) × 1011 cm on MJD 53470.5, during the hy-
persoft state proper. This hypersoft excess has a tem-
perature of Tex = 7200 ± 400 K.

One complication is the observation on MJD 53512.4,
which appears to be aﬀected by the bright ﬂares af-
ter the hypersoft state. For this observation,
if we
let the baseline blackbody radius vary, it increases to
6.0 ± 0.3 × 1011 cm. If we instead allow a brief return of
the hypersoft blackbody with T = 7200 K, the radius is
(2.5 ± 0.1) × 1011 cm.

Given their large sizes, it is worth comparing the mea-
sured blackbody radii to characteristic orbital size scales
in GRO J1655–40. For the orbital parameters adopted
above, the eﬀective Roche lobe radius and tidal radius
of the accretion disk are RL ∼ 0.47a and Rtide ∼ 0.42a,
respectively, where a = 1.1 × 1012 cm is the semi-major
axis (see formulas in Eggleton 1983; Frank et al. 2002;
Leahy & Leahy 2015). The baseline blackbody has a
radius ∼ 70% larger than the Roche lobe of the sec-
ondary star, and therefore may include contributions not
only from the heated face of the companion but also
the outer accretion disk and/or hot spot. The excess
is more interesting. Because the outer radius of the ac-
cretion disk Rout should not be larger than Rtide, we ﬁnd
Rout ≤ 4.8 × 1011 cm, meaning that at maximum, i.e.,
during the plateau/hypersoft state, the component re-
sponsible for the blackbody excess enshrouds the whole
accretion disk.

4.2. X-ray Spectra of the Hypersoft State

To support characterizing the X-ray data from MJD
53450–53500 as a hypersoft state, Uttley & Klein-Wolt
(2015) pointed to the unusual shape of the X-ray spec-
trum, which is not well described by the standard model
of a disk blackbody and a Comptonized power law. In-
deed, for three sample spectra, a joint ﬁt of an absorbed,

Comptonized disk blackbody (Steiner et al. 2009 and ref-
erences therein) plus an additional absorption edge re-
sulted in a reduced χ2 in excess of 10. We noted in
Neilsen & Homan (2012) that modeling the hard com-
ponent with nthcomp (Zdziarski et al. 1996; ˙Zycki et al.
1999) or including a high-energy cutoﬀ can lead to sat-
isfactory spectral ﬁts during this period. Thus, alter-
natives to the standard disk-plus-power law model are
desirable.
In this section, we brieﬂy explore the be-
havior of this standard model, which we call Model
1, and then consider two alternative continuum mod-
els: ezdiskbb+nthcomp and ezdiskbb+bremss (Models
2 and 3, in which we separately replace the power law
with nthcomp and bremsstrahlung, respectively).

In addition to the continuum components described
above, each ﬁt includes a Gaussian emission line in the
5-8 keV range, a smeared absorption edge to account
for the eﬀect of ionized absorption (both lines and edges;
smedge), and interstellar absorption (TBnew; Wilms et al.
2000). We ﬁx NH < 1022 cm−2 based on the 0.5–8 keV
Chandra Medium Energy Grating (MEG) spectrum ﬁrst
published by Miller et al. (2006). The continuum com-
ponents are normalized by their 3-25 keV unabsorbed
ﬂuxes using the cflux convolution model. We perform
these spectral ﬁts within the Interactive Spectral Inter-
pretation System (ISIS; Houck & Denicola 2000; Houck
2002).

4.2.1. Model 1: ezdiskbb+powerlaw

Since Uttley & Klein-Wolt (2015) already noted that
Model 1 provides formally unacceptable ﬁts to the X-ray
spectra of the hypersoft state, we shall not dwell on it
in great detail (for clarity, we omit the evolution of its
parameters from Figure 4). It is useful, however, to the
extent that it provides a sense of what to expect from
our alternative models in subsequent sections.

In Model 1, the pre-hypersoft portion of the outburst
proceeds normally, beginning in a state dominated by a
hard power law with a photon index Γ ∼ 1.4 − 2.2. As
the total ﬂux rises, so does the fraction of the ﬂux con-
tributed by the disk; by the initial peak of the outburst
around MJD 53447, the disk contributes ∼ 90% of the to-
tal ﬂux. After this, however, the results begin to deviate
from typical black hole behavior. The disk component
begins to fade and the power law simultaneously bright-
ens and softens (reaching our upper limit of Γ ∼ 5 within
a few days). In addition, the smedge optical depth τsm
rises to roughly 3 by MJD 53455 and remains steady for
the duration of the hypersoft state. In general, there is
fairly little evolution of spectral parameters during this
plateau, and the model returns a typical reduced χ2 of
1.5-3. After MJD 53500, the power law returns to normal
values between 2 and 3, τsm decreases to ∼ 0, and the
ﬁts become statistically acceptable again. The upshot,
which echoes the results of Uttley & Klein-Wolt (2015),
is that the X-ray spectrum of the hypersoft state is quite
steep but not well described by a power law, in part due
to signiﬁcant absorption structure in the 5-10 keV band,
but also due to strong curvature in the broadband con-
tinuum.

Neilsen et al.

One option for introducing curvature into the spectrum
is a more physically-motivated Comptonization model
(as the power law primarily represents the case of a scat-
tering medium with high temperature and low optical
depth). As noted above, for Model 2 we replace the
power law in Model 1 with nthcomp. Since we are in-
terested in the scattering optical depth τ , we constrain
the photon index Γ to be a function of τ and the elec-
tron temperature kTe according to the formula given by
Sunyaev & Titarchuk (1980); Ueda et al. (2009):

Γ =s2.25 +

3

(kTe/511 keV)((τ + 1.5)2 − 2.25)

− 0.5.

(1)
Where possible (i.e., where χ2
ν < 1.5 without the disk
component) we ﬁt the spectrum with nthcomp alone;
otherwise, we tie the temperature of the seed photons—
which have a blackbody spectrum—to the disk temper-
ature. According to Model 2, much of the outburst
proceeds as in the initial analysis. Prior to the hyper-
soft state, the Compton component dominates the ﬂux,
and no disk is required for the earliest phase of the out-
burst. Here kTe is large (in most cases consistent with
1 MeV but generally constrained to be above 10 keV)
and τ . 0.3, such that the Compton component mimics
a power law over the observed energy range.

As the ﬂux rises to its peak, the equivalent photon
index Γ rises from ∼ 1.5 to ∼ 2.2, τ decreases, and the
disk comes to dominate the spectrum (see Figure 4). But
then, around MJD 53450, the disk fraction begins to fall
again, and within a few days there is no evidence for a
direct disk component.
Instead, the spectrum appears
to be that of a low temperature (kTe & 1.7 keV), high
optical depth (τ ∼ 5 − 8) scattering medium. Although
the exact evolution is diﬃcult to track, because manually
removing the disk component when it is not required en-
hances some of the sharp changes in the ﬁt parameters,
it is presumably this optically thick scattering medium
that is responsible for the eﬀective disappearance of the
disk. During the hypersoft state, the scattering opti-
cal depth decreases slowly and the electron temperature
rises slowly, until the spectrum begins to return to its
pre-hypersoft conﬁguration around MJD 53495. Dur-
ing the period when the electron temperature is lowest,
the total ﬁt statistic (combined over all 86 spectra) is
χ2/ν = 2310.864/2573 = 0.898.

4.2.3. Model 3: bremss+powerlaw

The sudden change in the behavior of the Comp-
ton component in Model 2, from a hot optically thin
medium to a much cooler medium with a much higher
optical depth raises some questions about the physi-
cal plausibility of this model (see Section 5). As an
alternative, we consider Model 3, in which we replace
the power law emission in Model 1 with bremsstrahlung
(bremsstrahlung accounts for the curvature in the spec-
trum at higher energies better than the power law).

While bremsstrahlung is rarely used to model X-ray
emission from stellar mass black holes3, the ﬁrst thing to

state X-ray spectrum in Cyg X-3, but to our knowledge this
argument has not been applied to the hypersoft state.

argued

note about the results of Model 3 is their similarity to
those of Model 2:

• The total ﬂux light curve (Figure 4) is nearly in-
distinguishable between Models 2 and 3, and the
smeared edges are also somewhat similar (with
the exception of some discontinuities attributable
to the combined uncertainty in the location and
strength of the edge and iron line).

• Outside the hypersoft state, the bremsstrahlung
component contributes the same fraction of the to-
tal ﬂux as the Compton component in Model 2,
and the disk temperatures in Model 2 and 3 are
very similar.

• The bremsstrahlung temperature is similar to the
electron temperature in the hypersoft state, and
its evolution during the rest of the outburst is very
similar to that of the scattering optical depth in
Model 2.

In other words, Model 3 captures the same qualitative
spectral evolution described in Section 4.2.1: a normal
hard component with a sharply brightening soft compo-
nent, followed by a hypersoft state dominated by a steep
and curved component with signiﬁcant absorption struc-
ture, and ﬁnally a return to typical soft/hard compo-
nent behavior after the hypersoft state. The ﬁt qual-
ity, however, is not as good:
the total ﬁt statistic is
χ2/ν = 2820.558/2574 = 1.096.

Where Model 3 diverges from Models 1 and 2 is in
the physical characterization of the hypersoft state itself.
Clearly the same spectral evolution is reﬂected in the ﬁt
parameters, but while one model attributes this to an
optically thick scattering medium, the latter model ex-
plains it as thermal emission from an optically thin cloud.
We discuss the signiﬁcance of these results in Section 5.

5. DISCUSSION

A comprehensive explanation of the multiwavelength
variability properties of the hypersoft state in GRO
J1655–40 is beyond the scope of this work. Uttley &
Klein-Wolt (2015) have already presented models for the
timing behavior of the system, and the high-resolution
X-ray spectral observations of the disk wind have been
analyzed in detail. Here we focus on three speciﬁc issues:
(1) the nature of the unusual X-ray continuum during
this state, (2) the origin of the OIR blackbody excess,
and (3) the connection between these phenomena and
the accretion disk wind. We shall argue that not only
are these processes inextricable, but also that the wind
may be responsible for both the X-ray emission and the
OIR excess. In the OIR, we restrict our attention to the
hypersoft excess, on the idea that the baseline blackbody
component can be attributed to some combination of the
irradiated face of the donor star and emission from the
outer disk and/or hot spot.

For clarity, we oﬀer a brief sketch of the structure of
this section. First, in Section 5.1, we suppose that the
observed X-ray emission is produced in the inner accre-
tion disk and corona and subsequently absorbed by an
ionized wind at & 109 cm from the black hole. This sce-
nario does not provide a satisfactory interpretation of the
OIR excess (or for the existence of a cool, dense corona),

statistically required. The soft ratio is the fraction of the total ﬂux emitted by the soft component (ezdiskbb or bremss). In the bottom
right panel, τ is the optical depth in the thermal Comptonization component; the inset shows the optical depth in the smeared absorption

so we consider modiﬁcations in which the X-ray emission
arises in the wind, whether due to Compton scattering
(Section 5.2.1) or thermal emission (Section 5.2.2). We
conclude that a Compton-thick wind provides the best
explanation for the properties of the hypersoft state.

5.1. Hypersoft State due to an Optically Thick Corona
In Section 4.2, we showed that the X-ray continuum
during the hypersoft state could be described as emis-
sion from an accretion disk Comptonized by cool elec-
trons with a high optical depth (Model 2). From the
perspective of the canonical behavior of black holes in
outburst (e.g., Fender et al. 2004; Remillard & McClin-
tock 2006; Belloni 2010a), this model is not completely
intuitive, but we begin here because the Comptonized
accretion disk model is at least superﬁcially consistent
with expectations.

5.1.1. The X-ray spectrum

The salient feature of Model 2 is a precipitous drop
in the electron temperature coupled with a sharp rise in
the scattering optical depth roughly 10 days after the
peak of the outburst (i.e., MJD ∼ 53459). The error
bars on kTe are signiﬁcant, but the best ﬁt value drops
from ∼ 990 keV to 2.4 keV between MJD 53458.58 and
53459.10. These conclusions are robust to the Comp-
tonization model used: simpl (Steiner et al. 2009) modi-
ﬁed to allow a high-energy cutoﬀ, nthcomp, comptt, and

eqpair (Coppi 1999) all lead to similar conclusions. The
ﬁnal temperature is unusually low for coronal electrons,
and is particularly atypical for spectrally soft states
(where some lines of evidence indicate that non-thermal
electrons may dominate Comptonization processes, e.g.,
Gierli´nski et al. 1999; Done et al. 2007 and references
therein).

The main challenge, then, for a physical scenario re-
lating the hypersoft state to an optically thick corona
around the black hole is explaining why the electrons
cool so much. Without detailed constraints on the size
and geometry of the emitting region, it is diﬃcult to say
much about the energetics of Model 2 and its variants.
However, a cursory analysis with eqpair (speciﬁcally, a
comparison between a pre-hypersoft observation and a
hypersoft observation, on MJDs 53444.49 and 53463.48,
respectively) indicates that during the hypersoft state,
there is marginally more power in the electron accelera-
tion process than in the seed photons4. The model also
indicates a ∼ 20% decrease in the normalization (i.e.,
seed photon ﬂux; Gierli´nski et al. 1999; Nowak et al.
2012) during the hypersoft state, but it appears that the

4 Since this is essentially the ratio between heating and cool-
ing, it is a major determining factor for the electron temperature
(see, e.g., Done & Gierli´nski 2003; Done et al. 2007 and references
therein). The models described here are for purely thermal Comp-
tonization.

10

Neilsen et al.

sharp decrease in electron temperature is driven primar-
ily by a ∼ 100× increase in the scattering optical depth.
What, then, is the origin of the increase in τ ? For a
ﬁxed number of electrons, the optical depth will rise if
the scattering medium becomes more compact. But it
does not seem plausible for a typical corona to shrink
by a factor of 100, and there is no self-evident way to
understand the association between such a small corona
and the large blackbody excess described in Section 4.1.2.
As we argue in the next section, unrelated explanations
of the OIR excess are unsatisfactory. Thus we are left
with the alternative: there must be more cool (cooling)
electrons along the line of sight.

5.2. X-rays from the Wind?

In Section 5.1, we considered Model 2, in which we
treated the X-ray spectrum as disk emission Comp-
tonized by a hot corona. Although the spectral ﬁts were
good, it was diﬃcult to interpret the results without in-
voking the appearance of a new population of electrons.
Fortunately, observations indicate the sudden appear-
ance of a large column density of highly-ionized X-ray
absorbing gas (the accretion disk wind), and there is
nothing in the ﬁt model speciﬁc to the corona; could
the free electrons in the wind be responsible for scat-
tering the disk emission during the hypersoft state? Or
(Section 5.2.2) could the wind directly emit the X-rays?

5.1.2. The optical/infrared excess

5.2.1. Scattering in the wind

Interpreted as the appearance of a compact, optically
thick corona, Model 2 sheds little light on the nature of
the OIR excess, a ∼ 7000 K blackbody with a radius com-
parable at peak to the size of the accretion disk. Since
the OIR emission is expected to drop in soft states even
in scenarios where it is produced by a hot accretion ﬂow
or corona (e.g., Veledina et al. 2013), here we consider
whether it is possible to attribute this emission to the ac-
cretion disk or to the companion star, and whether they
could produce the ∼ 10% variability with orbital phase.
While it is tempting to attribute the excess to the disk
itself, there is a signiﬁcant problem with this interpreta-
tion: the disk area is too small. At the orbital inclination
of GRO J1655−40, a disk with the same projected area
as the spherical blackbody would have a radius greater
than the orbital separation of the binary. Furthermore,
emission from the outer disk (either intrinsic or irradi-
ated) is already included in our SED modeling via the
power law and the baseline blackbody. The disk does
not appear to present a viable explanation for the ex-
cess, although the ∼ 10% variability is comparable to
what is seen in superhumps (e.g., Smak 2006).

At face value, a stellar interpretation is even more
tempting, since the temperature of the blackbody during
the hypersoft state is comparable to that of the F6IV
companion (Figure 3), and the excess exhibits orbital
variability. However, this interpretation encounters a
similar problem to the blackbody-in-the-disk scenario:
the area of the blackbody excess is a factor of ∼ 2.3
larger than the surface area of the companion star (i.e.,
its Roche lobe; Leahy & Leahy 2015). Furthermore, as
with the disk, the stellar contribution is likely accounted
for by the baseline blackbody. Finally, the wavelength-
independent amplitude of the smooth OIR variability is
not consistent with the strong wavelength dependence
of the ellipsoidal modulations of the secondary (Greene
et al. 2001). Together, these points indicate that the
excess is likely unrelated to the companion.

As an aside, it is worth noting that if we use Foellmi
et al. (2006)’s distance to GRO J1655–40 of 1.7 kpc, the
stellar surface area problem may be lessened or allevi-
ated. The other problems we mentioned would still re-
main, however, in addition to the failure of the secondary
to ﬁll its Roche lobe (see the private communication in
Miller et al. 2008). It therefore seems likely that the OIR
excess is related to origin of the X-ray properties of the
hypersoft state, which further rules out the compact cold
corona hypothesis for the X-ray emission.

There are two primary complications for the scattering
scenario. First, the observed electron optical depth in the
wind τw ∼ 0.6 (i.e., NH,w . 1024 cm−2; Kallman et al.
2009) is less than the scattering optical depth τe ∼ 5.
But the measured column density only probes a narrow
region in ionization space, and there may be a signiﬁcant
amount of fully ionized material in the wind that is not
visible in X-ray line absorption. For reference, if the
average density and extent of the fully ionized portion of
the wind are comparable to the same quantities measured
in the X-ray absorber (ne ∼ 1015 cm−3, R < 7 × 109 cm;
Kallman et al. 2009; Miller et al. 2008), then the total
optical depth could easily approach 5, and the observed
wind column density and the Compton scattering optical
depth can plausibly be reconciled.

The second issue is that the Comptonized spectrum is
sensitive to the (unknown) compactness of the scatter-
ing medium (e.g., Coppi 1999), so in order for the same
eqpair analysis of Section 5.1 to hold, the change in
the size of the scattering medium (at least two orders of
magnitude from the corona to the wind) would have to
be eﬀectively balanced by changes in the seed photon lu-
minosity and electron acceleration power (i.e., the wind
heating/driving mechanism). For a much lower compact-
ness (e.g., for a ﬁxed luminosity and a much larger scat-
tering region), Compton cooling is negligible compared
to bremsstrahlung cooling and Coulomb collisions (Coppi
1999), which provides a physical motivation for Model 3.

5.2.2. Bremsstrahlung from the wind

Here we focus on the bremsstrahlung component in
Model 3, where the change in the spectrum around MJD
53459 is explained not by a change in the temperature
of some scattering medium, but by the fact that around
this date, the cold bremsstrahlung component begins to
make a signiﬁcant contribution to the observed X-ray
ﬂux. At the same time, as noted above, high-resolution
X-ray spectra reveal an X-ray absorbing wind that is
both dense and highly ionized – precisely what is needed
to produce signiﬁcant bremsstrahlung emission. Here we
ask: is the wind suﬃciently hot and suﬃciently luminous
to produce the observed X-ray emission?

The bremsstrahlung normalization is given by

Kbr =

3.02 × 10−15

where D = 9.8 × 1021 is the distance to the source in

is the ion density, and V is the volume of the emitting
region. Assuming a fully ionized spherical homogeneous
emitter with ISM abundances (Wilms et al. 2000), vol-
ume ﬁlling factor f , and radius R, we can simplify the
normalization: Kbr = 8.5 × 10−60n2
eR3f. Plugging in the
numbers from Kallman et al. (2009) (quoted here in Sec-
tion 5.2.1), we estimate Kbr,wind = 3f.

Although this is below the observed normalization
(typically in the range of 5-20 during the hypersoft state),
it is important to remember that this Kbr,wind = 3f re-
sult is based on the photoionization calculations of Miller
et al. (2006, 2008); Kallman et al. (2009), which implic-
itly assume a point source geometry for the X-ray source.
But we cannot take this geometry for granted, since both
Models 2 and 3 are consistent with much or all of the
observed X-ray emission emerging from the wind. On
MJD 53470.5 (i.e., coinciding with our hypersoft state
OIR SED), the bremsstrahlung normalization is 14+7
−5. If
we set f = 1 and integrate from R = 7 × 109 cm to
R = Rex = 5.2 × 1011 cm, we can reproduce Kbr = 14
with an average density of ne = (3.1 ± 0.6) × 1012 cm−3,
which is comparable to what is typically assumed for
disk winds. If the density instead falls oﬀ like R−2, we
will have Kbr ∼ 14 for ne = (1.1 ± 0.2) × 1015 cm−3 at
R = 7 × 109 cm. It is clear that the details are model
dependent, but the result is unexpected: if we use mass
continuity to extend a wind similar to the one described
by Kallman et al. (2009), that wind could have a suﬃ-
ciently large volume emission measure to contribute to
the X-ray spectrum observed during the hypersoft state.
There are several important caveats for Model 3. First,
bremsstrahlung emission should have associated atomic
emission lines, which are not observed. Since Kallman
et al. (2009) report absorption line optical depths as high
as 40, it is possible that the thermal emission lines are
suppressed by the high column density absorber, but it
would be unlikely to completely hide an emission com-
ponent or a P-Cygni proﬁle (although in their very high
spectral resolution analysis, Miller et al. 2015 do ﬁnd
evidence for some such broadened emission lines from
disk winds; see also Miller et al. 2016). Furthermore,
we have only modeled the emission from optically thin
gas, but for the density distributions derived from the
bremsstrahlung normalizations in the preceding para-
graph, the electron scattering optical depth can be well
above 1 (see Section 5.2.4). This is not directly indica-
tive of bremsstrahlung self-absorption, but it is evident
that full radiative transfer would be needed to describe
the emission in this model. Finally, given the high op-
tical depths and the fact that optically thick thermal
Comptonization provides a much better ﬁt to the data,
we prefer Model 2 to Model 3.

5.2.3. The temperature of the wind

We have established that an extended, dense wind
could have a suﬃciently large optical depth in electrons
to produce the thermal Comptonization spectrum of the
hypersoft state. But are the electrons in the wind hot
enough to match the observed temperature of 2 keV?
It is not entirely clear what the electron temperature in
the wind should be. For instance, the Compton tem-
perature of the hypersoft spectrum is just under 1 keV
(see Rahoui et al. 2010; Neilsen & Homan 2012 and ref-

erences therein), but if the X-ray continuum is produced
locally in the wind (whether by Compton scattering or
bremsstrahlung), then the observed radiation is unlikely
to be responsible for heating the gas. If either of these
models is accurate, we have no constraint on the intrinsic
radiation ﬁeld during the hypersoft state: some or all of
the inner disk is highly obscured.

For reference, the Compton temperature in the pre-
hypersoft state X-ray observations reaches 7-8 keV
(Neilsen & Homan 2012). We conclude that 2 keV is
a reasonable temperature for Compton-heated electrons
during the hypersoft state. This is not to suggest that
the wind must be driven by Compton heating, but sim-
ply to indicate that plausible estimates of the electron
temperature in the wind bracket what is actually ob-
served in the X-ray spectrum. If the wind is driven by
magnetic processes (e.g., Miller et al. 2008), the electron
temperature could conceivably be rather diﬀerent than
in Compton heating scenarios.

5.2.4. A Compton-thick wind

It appears that if we accept that the observed X-ray
spectrum is well described by nthcomp and that the ab-
sorption lines are produced in a narrow region of an ex-
tended, predominantly fully-ionized wind, then it is diﬃ-
cult to avoid the conclusion that the wind in its entirety
(i.e., not just the X-ray absorber) is Compton thick. As
noted above, the equivalent column density of the X-ray
absorption line system in the wind is already ∼ 2/3 of
the Compton-thick limit, and any additional fully-ionized
material will increase the total optical depth in the wind
(see a similar suggestion from Uttley & Klein-Wolt 2015).
By way of example, in the uniform density scenario for
Model 3 in Section 5.2.2, the electron optical depth is
τ ∼ 1, and this rises to τ ∼ 5.3 in the ne ∝ R−2 case.
These are rough estimates, since they are sensitive to the
integration limits and the spectral model: Model 3 treats
only a fraction of the emission as arising in the wind,
leading to lower apparent bremsstrahlung normalizations
and electron scattering optical depths than Model 2.

Reynolds (2012) details the conditions under which
such a Compton-thick wind can and cannot be launched
from the inner accretion disk by radiation pressure
and magnetocentrifugal acceleration. These conditions
amount to constraints on the ratio τ /λ as a function of
radius, where λ is the Eddington ratio of the inner accre-
tion ﬂow. Ideally we would apply that analysis to GRO
J1655–40 to determine whether or not our explanation is
plausible (see Neilsen 2013). However, because our work
indicates a substantial uncertainty in λ, τ , and the loca-
tion of the wind, we shall not consider these constraints
in detail.

It is worth noting, however, that our inference of a
Compton-thick wind leads to a natural explanation for
the non-detection of the inner accretion ﬂow during the
hypersoft state in Model 2: we simply cannot see it due
to obscuration by the wind. The radiation is absorbed
and scattered by the high column density wind. At lower
inclination, the source could appear to be much more lu-
minous, by a factor of over two orders of magnitude if our
estimates of τ are applicable. We therefore echo the sug-
gestion of Uttley & Klein-Wolt (2015) that the intrinsic
luminosity of the accretion ﬂow could be at or above the
Eddington limit (see also Section 5.3). Because thermal

12

Neilsen et al.

driving can be boosted by radiation pressure at high Ed-
dington ratios (see Proga & Kallman 2002; Neilsen et al.
2011 and references therein), and because our best mod-
els require an alternative geometry for the X-ray emis-
sion and absorption, it may be illuminating to revisit the
physical origin of this wind using models that are capable
of unifying the X-ray and optical/infrared emission.

5.3. The Blackbody Excess

If we suppose that an extended Compton-thick wind
can explain the origin of the soft, curved X-ray contin-
uum and the absence of standard disk/corona radiation
during the hypersoft state, can it also explain the black-
body excess in the optical and infrared? Since the wind
is optically thick, any radiation it absorbs should be ther-
malized and re-emitted in the outer regions.
Indeed,
King & Pounds (2003) demonstrated that Compton-
thick winds from black holes accreting near or above the
Eddington limit should produce blackbody-like emission
from an outer photosphere (see also Begelman et al. 2006;
Poutanen et al. 2007; Middleton et al. 2015; Shen et al.
2015; Soria & Kong 2016; Urquhart & Soria 2016), where
the optical depth is equal to unity. We present a cartoon
of this scenario in Figure 5. Here we explore whether
this model can explain a ∼ 7, 000 K blackbody in GRO
J1655–40.

In an extension of the Shen et al. (2015) model, So-
ria & Kong (2016) derive the radius and temperature of
the blackbody photosphere Rbb and Tbb for a spherical
geometry as

where ǫw is the fraction of the accretion power that pow-
ers the wind, fv is the ratio of the wind speed to the
escape speed evaluated at the launch radius of the wind,
X is the hydrogen mass fraction, m is the black hole mass
in M⊙, and ˙m is the external mass accretion rate in Ed-
dington units. The accretion disk wind velocity during
the 2005 outburst was measured at 375 km s−1(Miller
et al. 2008; Kallman et al. 2009), which corresponds to
fv ∼ 0.03 − 0.07 for plausible launch radii (Neilsen 2013).
Here we assume solar abundances (X = 0.73).

We ﬁnd that we are able to reproduce the observed
radius and temperature of the excess blackbody during
the hypersoft state (Rbb = Rex = (5.2 ± 0.2) × 1011
cm and Tbb = Tex = (7200 ± 400) K, respectively) with
ǫw ∼ 0.9999 and ˙m = 35 − 75. That is, if the avail-
able mass supply is highly super-Eddington, and essen-
tially all of the available accretion power goes to ac-
celerating an energy-driven wind, we expect the OIR
excess observed in GRO J1655–40. For these parame-
ters, using Equation 23 from Poutanen et al. (2007), the

mass loss rate in the wind is between 17 and 40 times
the Eddington rate. For comparison, the constant den-
sity spherical wind model described above would have a
mass loss rate > 14 ˙MEdd (c.f. Lee et al. 2002). These
numbers are very large but are quoted for a spheri-
cal geometry, and the actual values may be somewhat
lower. Miller et al. (2015) assume a covering factor of
0.2 (see also Miller et al. 2006). The model also pre-
dicts the radiative luminosity at the base of the wind
(see also Shakura & Sunyaev 1973; Poutanen et al. 2007):
L/LEdd = (1 + 0.6 ln ˙m) = 3.1 − 3.6. In other words, the
GRO J1655−40 accretion disk itself was likely super-
Eddington during the hypersoft state if our analysis is
correct (Uttley & Klein-Wolt 2015 come to the same con-
clusion based on timing analysis).

There are, however, some reasons for caution when ap-
plying this model to GRO J1655–40. First, the model
assumes that electron scattering dominates the opacity.
For a fully ionized wind, this is sensible, but if our as-
sertion is that the photosphere is 7,000 K, the absorp-
tion opacity may not be negligible in the outer regions of
the wind. Indeed, the prescription for absorption opac-
ity in Soria & Kong (2016) is comparable to electron
scattering opacity for the high densities in the wind and
for temperatures below ∼ 105 K, so it is plausible that
this assumption is violated. This is important for un-
derstanding the radial ionization, density, and velocity
proﬁles in the wind, but ultimately may require detailed
radiative transfer models. This is especially necessary
because the apparently very low ionization parameter of
the outer wind (corresponding to T ∼ 7, 000 K) is ∼ 5
orders of magnitude below that inferred for the X-ray
absorber. Thus, depending on the opacity proﬁle, the
quantity neR2 may need to increase signiﬁcantly with ra-
dius, in which case the assumption of a constant velocity
in the wind would also need revision. On a related note,
it should be clear that our interpretation depends on the
frequency-dependent opacity in this outﬂow: higher en-
ergy photons can emerge from deeper within the ﬂow
(Shen et al. 2015; see also Urquhart & Soria 2016).

We therefore tentatively conclude that the hypersoft
state data are consistent with models of supercritical
Compton thick winds. This conclusion must be tenta-
tive because we appear to be in a regime of parameter
space where the assumptions of these models may not be
entirely accurate, and may require a complete physical
model. For the moment, we leave this tension unresolved,
but we note that these observations present an exciting
challenge for models of winds, and we encourage future
theoretical eﬀorts to explain the data presented here.

If the OIR excess can indeed be related to the photo-
sphere of a Compton-thick wind, we may ﬁnally be in
a position to consider the origin of the smooth modu-
lation in the SMARTS light curves. A simple, plausi-
ble explanation for this periodicity would be that the
photosphere of the wind is not completely axisymmetric
(whether due to a warp in the disk, asymmetries in the
driving mechanism, or some interaction with the accre-
tion stream), such that the eﬀective area of the photo-
sphere is a function of orbital phase. The amplitude of
the orbital oscillation is also similar to the typical ampli-
tude of superhumps, as noted above, so it is possible that
the modulation is due to the precession of an asymmetry

6. CONCLUSION

By all accounts, the 2005 outburst of GRO J1655–40
was remarkable. Although it began much like any other
black hole outburst, signiﬁcant departures from the norm
are apparent in the ﬁrst few weeks of observations. As
detailed by Uttley & Klein-Wolt (2015), after a fairly
typical spectrally hard state, instead of entering a normal
spectrally soft state, the source transitioned to a ‘hyper-
soft’ state, characterized by a steep hard X-ray spectrum
(Γ > 5 at 15–20 keV) that is not well described by the
standard disk-plus-powerlaw model. Moreover, this hy-
persoft state coincided with (1) a period of unusual evo-
lution in the timing properties of the system (speciﬁcally,
a bend frequency that was extremely sensitive to the X-
ray ﬂux; Uttley & Klein-Wolt 2015), (2) extremely deep
absorption lines from an exceptional accretion disk wind
(previously argued to be driven by magnetic processes;
Miller et al. 2006; Netzer 2006; D´ıaz Trigo et al. 2007;
Miller et al. 2008; Kallman et al. 2009; Neilsen & Homan
2012) and, (3) as we have reported here, an unusual ex-
cess in the optical, infrared, and UV emission from the
accretion ﬂow. This excess is steady for the duration of
the hypersoft state, although it appears to vary with bi-
nary orbital phase. Importantly, it appears to be much
too large to be attributable to the accretion disk or the
companion star.

It is our contention here that these “coincidences”
are not coincidences at all. The hot, dense accretion
disk wind that is clearly observed during the hypersoft
state can produce a steep, curved X-ray spectrum via
Compton scattering in the low temperature/high op-
tical depth regime, with a possible contribution from
bremsstrahlung cooling. The physical variability of this
wind, i.e., variations in its column density and optical
depth, may be partly responsible for the unusual timing
properties of the hypersoft state (see Model C in Utt-
ley & Klein-Wolt 2015), but our analysis indicates an
additional possibility not considered by Uttley & Klein-
Wolt: some of the intrinsic variability is itself produced in

the wind. We suggest here that the very same extended
wind could be responsible for the blackbody excess and
its orbital variability. As we argue in Section 5.1.2, ef-
forts to explain the OIR data without reference to the
wind are unsatisfactory.
In contrast, however, models
of energy driven super-Eddington Compton-thick winds
(e.g., Poutanen et al. 2007; Shen et al. 2015; Soria &
Kong 2016) can successfully reproduce the observed ra-
dius and temperature of the blackbody excess during the
hypersoft state. Given the low temperature of our pho-
tosphere, we note that these models, which treat the
absorption opacity as negligible relative to scattering,
should be applied with caution, and we encourage ad-
ditional theoretical work to conﬁrm or refute our claim.
It may not be necessary to impress upon the reader
that we have proposed a fairly extreme scenario to ex-
plain these observations of GRO J1655–40: an accre-
tion disk wind that is so dense and so extended that
it not only obscures the bright inner accretion disk and
produces its own X-ray emission but also has its own
blackbody-emitting photosphere. Without drastically re-
ducing the distance to the source and causing the sec-
ondary to fail to ﬁll its Roche lobe, it is diﬃcult to explain
this OIR excess without reference to an extended object,
and a Compton-thick wind can possibly explain such a
photosphere and more. Although a robust estimate of
the mass loss rate in the wind requires detailed simu-
lations to account for its true energy-dependent opac-
ity and geometry, estimates based on theoretical de-
scriptions of Compton-thick outﬂows dominated by elec-
tron scattering opacity (Soria & Kong 2016 and refer-
ences therein) indicate that it could be > 17× the Ed-
dington rate (again, this may need to be reduced for a
smaller covering factor). While this an extreme mass loss
rate, the hypersoft state exhibits a set of unique multi-
wavelength timing and spectral behaviors, and it should
not come as a surprise that an extreme scenario is re-
quired for a comprehensive explanation of the data. But
whether or not our interpretation of the OIR emission is
accurate, it is a robust conclusion of our work that the
origin of the wind and the origin of the X-ray continuum
cannot be understood independently, and that there is
ample room for progress to be made in this area.

It should be noted, however, that the models ap-
plied here were not developed to explain GRO J1655–40.
A number of quasars and ultraluminous X-ray sources
(ULXs) have exhibited strong blackbody-like compo-
nents in their X-ray spectra, and some (ultraluminous
supersoft sources, ULSs) are dominated by this compo-
nent. In recent years, it has become apparent that this
emission and its variability can be produced by the pho-
tosphere of a Compton thick wind, launched by a super-
Eddington accretion ﬂow (e.g., Mukai et al. 2003; Fab-
biano et al. 2003; King & Pounds 2003; Begelman et al.
2006; Poutanen et al. 2007; Shen et al. 2015; Middleton
et al. 2015; Soria & Kong 2016; Urquhart & Soria 2016
and references therein). As clearly laid out by Begelman
et al. (2006) and Poutanen et al. (2007), these sources are
highly anisotropic, which explains why the same model
can be applied to ULXs and SS 433. Our results here
draw clear parallels between GRO J1655–40 and these
high accretion rate objects, and it seems that the hyper-
soft state in the 2005 outburst of this black hole may have
been a short-lived analog of the more persistent ULX

14

Neilsen et al.

behavior. This connection in fact makes the properties
of the hypersoft state seems somewhat less extreme, as
Urquhart & Soria (2016) ﬁnd that ULSs may generally
require ˙m ∼ a few 100, an order of magnitude higher
than required here for GRO J1655–40.

One pressing question remains unanswered: why did
this wind appear at all? Several lines of evidence in-
dicate a very large mass accretion rate onto the black
hole (producing radiation that is not visible from our
line of sight due to obscuration by the wind). But there
are to date no other conﬁrmed examples of such an ex-
treme outﬂow from a stellar-mass black hole transient
(although Soria et al. 2000 found evidence of a transient
opaque wind in their optical spectra of the 1994 outburst
of GRO J1655−40, and Ueda et al. 2009 reported a simi-
lar high low temperature, high optical depth scatterer as-
sociated with many absorption lines in GRS 1915+105),
and if our re-envisioned geometry is correct, there are no
clear indications of the processes that triggered its forma-
tion. What caused the accretion rate to spike so sharply
for ∼ 50 days? Is it even possible to achieve such high
accretion rates in GRO J1655-40? Our estimates here
clearly pose challenges to the standard picture of black

hole outbursts, and this highlights the necessity of im-
proving our treatment of the opacity in the wind for ac-
curate estimates of ˙m. At present, we cannot address this
using our data, but if indeed the OIR excess can be reli-
ably associated with a super-Eddington Compton-thick
wind, perhaps it can be used in the future to identify
such winds in new transients, and perhaps these systems
will shed additional light on the physics of winds around
stellar mass black holes.
