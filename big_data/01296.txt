On the class numbers of the ﬁelds of the
pn-torsion points of elliptic curves over Q

Fumio SAIRAIJI and Takuya YAMAUCHI ∗

Abstract

Let E be an elliptic curve over Q which has multiplicative reduction
at a ﬁxed prime p. For each positive integer n we put Kn := Q(E[pn]).
The aim of this paper is to extend the author’s previous results in [12]
concerning with the order of the p-Sylow group of the ideal class group of
Kn to more general setting. We also modify the previous lower bound of
the order and describe the new lower bound in terms of the Mordell-Weil
rank of E(Q) and the ramiﬁcation related to E.

Introduction

This article is a sequel of [12]. Let p be a prime number and E be an elliptic
curve over Q. For each positive integer n, We consider the ﬁeld Kn generated
by the coordinates of points on E[pn] over Q.
In [12] the authors studied a
lower bound of the class number hKn of Kn in terms of the Mordell-Weil rank
of E(Q) when E has prime conductor p. The present article extends this result
to a more extensive class of elliptic curves over Q.

For such an elliptic curve, we will carry out a similar estimation done in [12]
but at the same time we give an improvement of the method of the estimation.
As we have done in [12] the lower bound will be given in terms of the Mordell-
Weil rank and the information coming from the ramiﬁcation related to E with
a defect which occurs only when (p, n) = (2, 1).

Our study is motivated by the works of Greenberg [5] and Komatsu-Fukuda-
Yamagata [6] who have studied a lower bound of Iwasawa invariants for CM
ﬁelds in terms of the Mordell-Weil group of the corresponding CM abelian va-
rieties. We have pursued an analogue for non-CM elliptic curves since [12].

To state our main theorem we introduce our notation. The Mordell-Weil
theorem asserts that E(Q) is a ﬁnitely generated abelian group. Thus there
exists a free abelian subgroup A of E(Q) of ﬁnite rank such that A + E(Q)tors =
E(Q). We denote the rank of A by r. We put Gn := Gal(Kn/Q) and Ln :=
Kn([pn]−1
E A), where [pn]E is the multiplication-by-pn map on E. We denote
generators of A by P1, . . . , Pr. For each j in {1, . . . , r} we take a point Tj of
E(Ln) satisfying

[pn]E(Tj) = Pj .

Then we have Ln = Kn(T1, . . . , Tr). The Galois action on {Tj}j naturally
induces an injective Gn-homomorphism

Φn : Gal(Ln/Kn) → E[pn]r : σ 7→ (σTj − Tj)j.

(1)

In particular, the degree [Ln : Kn] is equal to a power of p.

We denote the maximal unramiﬁed abelian extension of Kn by K ur

n . We

deﬁne the exponent κn by

[Ln ∩ K ur

n : Kn] = pκn .

Let L1 be the completion of L1 at a ﬁxed prime in L1 over p. Since E has
multiplicative reduction at p, there exists a unique quadratic extension M over
Qp such that E/M is uniformized by the Tate curve. Then the main theorem
of this article is the following theorem.

Theorem 1.1. Let p be a prime number and let E be an elliptic curve over
Q which has multiplicative reduction at p. Assume that Gn ≃ GL2(Z/pnZ) for
each n ≥ 1 and p6 |ordp(∆). The following inequalities hold:
(1) Assume that p is odd. Then for any n ≥ 1,

where s(N ) stands for the number of primes ℓ such that ordℓ(N ) = 1.

κn ≥ 2n(r − s(N ))

(2) Assume that p = 2. Then for any n ≥ 2,

κn ≥ 2n(r − s(N ) − δ2)

and for n = 1,

κ1 ≥ 2(r − s(N ) − δ2) − ε(N ),

We explain the conditions imposed on E. Put

(1− (−1)ordℓ(∆)) and δ2 :=(cid:26) 0
where ε(N ) := Xordℓ(N )>1

It is known that Gn ≃ GL2(Z/pnZ) for n ≤ n0 implies Gn ≃ GL2(Z/pnZ) for
all n ≥ 1 (cf. §1 of [3]). For a given prime number p, there is a criterion for
Gn (n ≤ n0) to be isomorphic to GL2(Z/pnZ) (see [3] for p = 2, [4] for p = 3,
and [13] for p ≥ 5). The condition p6 |ordp(∆) is automatically satisﬁed when
p > 5 and E is a semistable elliptic curve (cf. Th´eor`eme 1, p. 176 of [10]). In
the case where p = 2, the meaning of δ2 will be revealed in §3 and M = Q2
(resp. M = Q2(√−3)) if E has split (resp. non-split) multiplicative reduction .
The organization of this paper is as follows. In §2, we study the extension
Ln/Kn. To do this we modify Bashmakov’s result [1] from Lang [8] for our el-
liptic curves. Then we investigate the degree [Ln : Kn] of the extension Ln/Kn.
A key point is to show the equality L1 ∩ K∞ = K1. To do this we separate

2

the situation into the case when p is odd and the case when p = 2. The former
case will be done in §4, but the latter case will be devoted to §5 because of
the particular treatment in which being p = 2 causes. In §3, we investigate the
degree of the p-adic completion of Ln over the one of Kn, which is used for the
estimate of the inertia group in §4. We give the proof of Theorem 1.1 in §4, and
we give numerical examples of κn in §6.

2 The extension Ln over Kn

In this section, we extends some results in [12] which has been done by the
arguments essentially based on Bashmakov [1] (cf. Lemma 1 of [8, p. 117]).

Let us keep the notation in §1 and throughout this paper we assume our
elliptic curve E always satisﬁes the condition in Theorem 1.1. Put K∞ :=
∪n≥1Kn, L∞ := ∪n≥1Ln and G∞ := Gal(K∞/Q). For each n ≥ 1 let us
consider the Gn-homomorphism

Φn : Gal(Ln/Kn) → E[pn]r.

It follows that the G∞-homomorphism

Φ∞ := lim
←−n

Φn : Gal(L∞/K∞) → Tp(E)r

is injective and the image is a closed subgroup. We are concerned with the order
of the image of Gn-homomorphism Φn. As we will see below, Φ1 controls Φ∞
and then the information for Φn comes up from Φ∞.

To obtain a lower bound of the class number in question, we need to study
that the image of Φn to grantee the degree [Ln : Kn] is large enough. We will
prove that Φn is isomorphic for any prime p and n ≥ 1.
Theorem 2.1. Assume that G1 ≃ GL2(Z/pZ). Then, Φ1 is an isomorphism
for any any prime p. In particular, the equality [L1 : K1] = p2r holds.

Proof. The proof given here is almost identical with the proof of Theorem 2.4
in [12]. Therefore we only explain a key point. Since G1 ≃ GL2(Z/pZ), the
Galois cohomology H 1(G1, E[p]) vanishes by [9]. Then there is an injective
homomorphism

A/[p]EA ֒→ HomG1 (Gal(L1/K1), E[p])

(see l. 6 in p. 283 of [12]). Therefore we have ♯HomG1(Gal(L1/K1), E[p]) ≥ pr,
where r is Z-rank of A. On the other hand Gal(L1/K1) ≃ E[p]s for some s ≤ r.
Then we see that

HomG1(Gal(L1/K1), E[p]) ≃ EndG1 (E[p])s ≃ (Z/pZ)s

which implies s ≥ r. Hence s = r and it turns that Φ1 is isomorphic.
To show that Φn is an isomorphism, we have the following lemma.

Lemma 2.2. The equality L1 ∩ K∞ = K1 holds for any prime p.
Proof. In case when p is odd prime the assertion follows from Lemmas 2.1 and
2.2 of [12]. In case when p = 2 it follows from Theorem 5.6.

3

Theorem 2.3. Assume that G1 ≃ GL2(Z/pZ). Then, Φn is an isomorphism
for n ≥ 1 and any prime p. In particular, the equality [Ln : Kn] = p2nr holds.
Proof. By Lemma 2.2, Gal(L1/L1 ∩ K∞) = Gal(L1/K1). Then we have the
following commutative diagram

Gal(L∞/K∞)

Φ∞−−−−→ Tp(E)r

Gal(L1/K1)

Φ1−−−−→ E[p]r,

α1y

αny

β1y

βny

where α1 is the restriction map and β1 is the reduction modulo p. Clearly these
vertical arrows are surjective.

Since Φ1 is an isomorphism by Theorem 2.1, Φ1 ◦ α1 is surjective. We
see that Φ∞ is surjective by using Nakayama’s Lemma. This gives rise to the
commutative diagram

Φ∞

Gal(L∞/K∞)

≃−−−−→ Tp(E)r

Gal(Ln/Ln ∩ K∞)

Φn−−−−→ E[pn]r,

where αn is the restriction map and βn is the reduction modulo pn. Thus it
follows that the restriction of Φn to Gal(Ln/Ln ∩ K∞) is surjective and thus
Φn is surjective. Since Φn is also injective, Φn is an isomorphism. Hence
[Ln : Kn] = p2nr.

Corollary 2.4. The equality Ln ∩ K∞ = Kn holds for n ≥ 1.
Proof. In the proof of Theorem 2.3, we saw that Φn and its restriction to
Gal(Ln/Ln ∩ K∞) are isomorphisms to E[pn]r. Thus we have Gal(Ln/Ln ∩
K∞) = Gal(Ln/Kn), and the assertion follows.

3 The inertia subgroups of Gal(Ln/Kn)

In this section we estimate the order of the inertia subgroups of Gal(Ln/Kn).
In particular we also improve the previous result (cf. Theorem 1.1 of [12]).

3.1 The local case
Let us recall the notation in §3 of [12]. Fix a natural number n. Put Kn :=
Qp(E[pn]) and let p be the prime ideal of Kn. Put Ln := Kn([pn]−1
E A) and let
P be the prime ideal of Ln. We will investigate the degree [Ln : Kn].
We denote the generators of A by P1, . . . , Pr, where A is the ﬁxed free
subgroup in E(Q). For each j in {1, . . . , r} we take Tj such that [pn]E(Tj) = Pj.
The injectivity of the homomorphism

n : Gal(Ln/Kn) → E[pn]r : σ 7→ (σTj − Tj)j
Φloc

shows that [Ln : Kn] divides p2nr.

4

We are now concerned with the inertia subgroup In of Gal(Ln/Kn). A key
point is to prove the cyclicity of In and we make use of the Tate curves to
conﬁrm it. Since E has multiplicative reduction at p, there exists q in pZp such
that E is isomorphic over M to the Tate curve Eq for some unramiﬁed extension
M over Qp of degree at most two and write ϕ : E → Eq for the isomorphism
over M. We deﬁne pj and tj in Eq(Qp) by

ϕ(Pj ) = pj

and ϕ(Tj) = tj

(1 ≤ j ≤ r)

(see §1 for Pj and Tj).

Assume that p ∤ ordp(q). We discuss about E(Qp)/[2n]E(E(Qp)).
When M = Qp, we have E(Qp) ≃ Eq(Qp). We have
p/Q∗pn

if p 6= 2
hqi × h−1i × hui ≃ Z/2nZ × Z/2Z × Z/2nZ if p = 2,

p =(cid:26) hqi × hui ≃ Z/pnZ × Z/pnZ

Q∗

(2)

for some u in Z∗
p.

Hence E(Qp)/[pn]E(E(Qp)) is an abelian group of type (pm), (2m, 2) for

some 0 ≤ m ≤ n.

When M 6= Qp, we have E(Qp) ≃ H/qZ, where

H := {x ∈ M∗ | NM/Q2(x) ∈ qZ}.

We investigate the structure of H/H pn
. If p 6= 2, we treated in our previous
paper (see [12] §3.1) and we consider the case of p = 2.
Since M/Q2 is unramiﬁed, NM/Q2M∗ = h22i× UQ2 and there does not exist
y in M such that NM/Q2 (y) = q. Thus we have NM/Q2 (x) ∈ qZ if and only if
NM/Q2 (x) ∈ q2Z.

Since NM/Q2 (q) = q2, we have

H = qZ × UM,1,

where UM,1 is the kernel of the norm mapping NM/Q2 M∗ to Q∗
unit group of M satisﬁes

2. Since the

and

we have

UM ≃ µ3 × U (1)

M ≃ µ3 × µ2 × Z⊕2

2

UQ2 ≃ µ2 × Z2,

UM,1 ≃ µ3 × µ2 × Z2,

where U (1)

Thus we have

M is the principal congruence subgroup modulo a uniformizer of M.

H/H ∗pn

=(cid:26) hqi × hui ≃ Z/pnZ × Z/pnZ

if p 6= 2
hqi × h−1i × hui ≃ Z/2nZ × Z/2Z × Z/2nZ if p = 2,
M . Hence E(Qp)/[pn]E(E(Qp)) is an abelian group of type

(3)

for some u in U (1)
(pm), (2m, 2) for some 0 ≤ m ≤ n.

We put

P := hp1, . . . , pr, qi/qZ

5

p

p/Q∗pn

(resp. H/H pn

in Q∗
) if M = Qp (resp. M 6= Qp). We discuss about
generators of the group P . We note that the subgroup of Z/pnZ of order
pm (0 < m ≤ n) is generated by a + pnZ with ordp(a) = n − m.

If p 6= 2, we put

pj = qaj ubj

(1 ≤ j ≤ r)

for some integers aj and bj such that 0 ≤ aj < 2n and 0 ≤ bj < 2n. We
may assume that ordp(b1) ≤ ordp(bj) for 2 ≤ j ≤ r. Since P is isomorphic
to a subgroup of hu, qi/qZ ≃ Z/pnZ, we have P = hp1, qi/qZ. We also have
MLn = MKn(t1).
If p = 2, we put

pj = qaj ubj (−1)cj

(1 ≤ j ≤ r)

for some integers aj, bj and cj such that 0 ≤ aj < 2n, 0 ≤ bj < 2n and cj = 0, 1.
Suppose that cj = 0 for all j. Then we may assume that ord2(b1) ≤ ord2(bj)
for 2 ≤ j ≤ r. We have P = hp1, qi/qZ.
Suppose that cj = 1 for some j. We may assume cr = 1. By replacing pj by
pjpr if cj = 1, we may assume cj = 0 for 1 ≤ j ≤ r − 1.

If ord2(b2

r) ≤ ord2(bj) for 2 ≤ j ≤ r, then

hp1, . . . , pr−1, p2

r, qi/qZ
and thus P = hpr, qi/qZ. We also have MLn = MKn(tr).
ord2(b2

r, qi/qZ = hp2

r). Then we have

We may assume ord2(b1) ≤ ord2(bj) for 2 ≤ j ≤ r − 1 and ord2(b1) <

hp1, . . . , pr−1, p2
and thus P = hp1, pr, qi/qZ. Since hp2
P is not a cyclic group.

Since ord2(b1) < ord2(b2

r, qi/qZ = hp1, qi/qZ
r, qi/qZ is a proper subgroup of hp1, qi/qZ,
r), the congruence b1x ≡ −br mod 2n holds for some
1, we may assume that pr = −1. We also have

integer x. By replacing pr by prpx
MLn = MKn(t1, ζ2n+1).
Proposition 3.1. Assume that p ∤ ordp(q). For a suitable change of basis of
a maximal free subgroup A of E(Q), the equation MLn = MKn(ϕ(T1)) or
MLn = MKn(ϕ(T1), ζ2n+1) holds. The latter case occurs only when p = 2, and
then we may assume ϕ(P2) = −1, ϕ(T2) = ζ2n+1 .

We are ready to study the inertia subgroup In of Gal(Ln/Kn). We denote
n. Since M/Qp is unramiﬁed, we

the inertia subgroup of Gal(MLn/MKn) by I ′
have I ′

By using the elements tj (1 ≤ j ≤ r) we have the commutative diagram

n ≃ In.

3.2 The global case

a basis of the maximal free subgroup A of E(Q) satisfying the assertion of
Proposition 3.1.

Let v be any prime above p in Kn and Iv the inertia subgroup of Gal(Ln/Kn)

at v. We recall the commutative diagram

Gal(Ln/Kn) ⊃ Iv

Φn−−−−→ E[pn]r

pr1 ◦ Φn : Iv ֒→ E[pn]

7

(resp. (pr1, pr2) ◦ Φn : Iv ֒→ E[2n] × E[2])

in the case of ζ4 /∈ ML1 (resp. ζ4 ∈ ML1).
Since Φn and prj commute with the action of Gn, we have

Put Ip := h Iv | v|p i. The Galois group Gn acts on {Iv}v|p transitively.

pr1 ◦ Φn : Ip ֒→ E[pn]

(resp. (pr1, pr2) ◦ Φn : Ip ֒→ E[2n] × E[2])

in the case of ζ4 /∈ ML1 (resp. ζ4 ∈ ML1).

Now we have the following theorem.

Theorem 3.2. The inequality | Ip | ≤ p2n holds for p 6= 2, and the inequality
| Ip | ≤ 22n+2δ2 holds for p = 2.
Remark 3.3. Note that the authors roughly estimated it as | Φn(Ip) | ≤ p4n in
§4 of [12].
3.3 The primes above ℓ 6= p
Let us recall that N is the conductor of E. We ﬁrst treat the prime ℓ 6= p
satisfying ordℓ(N ) = 1. Let v be any prime above ℓ in Kn and Iv the inertia
subgroup of Gal(Ln/Kn) at v. Put Iℓ := h Iv | v|ℓ i as before. Since Gal(Ln/Kn)
is of p-power order, each Iv factors through tame quotient, hence it is a cyclic
group.

The same argument in previous sections works for this case without any
change and therefore we have an upper bound | pr1 ◦ Φn(Iℓ) | ≤ p2n. Therefore
we have proved the following theorem.
Theorem 3.4. | Iℓ | ≤ p2n

Next we consider the prime ℓ 6= p satisfying ordℓ(N ) ≥ 2. In this case E
has potentially good reduction at ℓ. For such a prime ℓ we have the following
Lemma.

Lemma 3.5. Let E be an elliptic curve over Q which has potentially good
reduction at ℓ. For each (n, p) 6= (1, 2), the base change E/Kn has good reduction
at any prime in Kn above ℓ. If (n, p) = (1, 2) there is a quadratic extension

eK1/K1 so that E/eK1 has good reduction at any prime in eK1 above ℓ.

Proof. Let K1,ℓ the completion of K1 at a prime above ℓ. Let ρE,p be the p-adic
Galois representation from GQ to GL2(Zp) associated to the p-adic Tate module
Tp(E). It is easy to see that ρE,p(GK1) = 1 + pM2(Zp) is a torsion-free, pro-p
is non-trivial, the order
group if p > 2. If the restriction mapping ρE,p|IK1,ℓ
of ρE,p(IK1,ℓ ) becomes inﬁnite. Therefore E/K1,ℓ never has potentially good
reduction at ℓ which gives a contradiction.

When p = 2, it is easy to see that any torsion elements in 1 + 2M2(Z2) has
order at most 2. Since the action of IK1,ℓ on T2(E) is tame and ρE,p(GK1 ) is a
pro-2 group, the image ρE,p(IK1,ℓ ) is a (topologically) cyclic group. Therefore
ρE,p(IK1,ℓ ) is a ﬁnite of order at most 2 or it is of inﬁnite order. The latter case
can not happen as we have seen before. Thus if ρE,p(IK1,ℓ ) is non-trivial, we

can ﬁnd a quadratic extension eK1/K1 so that ρE,p(I eK1,v

8

) is trivial.

Assume that (n, p) 6= (1, 2). Let Iv the inertia subgroup of Gal(Ln/Kn) at
v above ℓ with ordℓ(N ) ≥ 2. Put Iℓ := h Iv | v|p i. Let Kn,v the completion of
Kn at v and R be the ring of integers of an algebraic closure K n,v of Kn,v.
By Lemma 3.5, E/Kn has good reduction at v and then one can take the
N´eron model E of E over Kn,v. By basic properties of N´eron models (cf. p.
12, Deﬁnition 1 and p. 16, Corollary 2 of [2]), we have the reduction map

E(Kn,v) = E(R) red→ eEv(Fv), where eEv is the reduction of E at v. Then for any

σ in Iv and P in E(K n,v) we see that red(σP ) = red(P ). Thus red ◦ Φn = {0}
by the deﬁnition of the Gn-isomorphism Φn from Gal(Ln/Kn) to E[pn]r.
It
follows from

that Φn(Iv) = {0} for any v dividing ℓ. Hence we have | Iℓ | = 1.

The remaining case is (n, p) = (1, 2). It is easy to see that

E[pn]r

red

∼→ eEv[pn]r,

| Iℓ | =(cid:26) 0

if E/K1 has good reduction on any prime on ℓ
otherwise.

It follows from this and the proof of Corollary 1.4 of [14] that

log2 | Iℓ | =

1
2

(1 − (−1)ordℓ(∆)).

(7)

4 Proof of Theorem 1.1

Let us keep our notation in §3 and assumptions in Theorem 1.1. Let I be the
subgroup of Gal(Ln/Kn) generated by all Iℓ satisfying ℓ|N .
We ﬁrst assume that p is odd. By applying the results in the previous section,
we have

| I | ≤Yℓ|N

| Iℓ | = Yordℓ(N )=1

| Iℓ | ≤ p2n·s(N ).

Thus we have

[Ln ∩ K ur

n : Kn] =

[Ln : Kn]
[Ln : LI

n] ≥

p2nr
p2n·s(N ) = p2n(r−s(N ))

(8)

for any n ≥ 1.

Next we assume that p = 2 and n ≥ 2. We recall that δ2 =(cid:26) 0 if ζ4 /∈ ML1

otherwise.

The defect δ2 is due to Theorem 3.2. Then we have

1

| I | ≤ p2n·s(N )+2δ2

and

[Ln ∩ K ur

n : Kn] =

[Ln : Kn]
[Ln : LI

n] ≥

p2nr

p2n·s(N )+2δ2

= p2n(r−s(N ))−2δ2

(9)

for any n ≥ 2.

Finally we consider the case when (p, n) = (2, 1). Similarly we have

| I | ≤ p2(s(N )+δ2)+ε(N ), ε(N ) := Xordℓ(N )>1

1
2

(1 − (−1)ordℓ(∆)),

9

where the defect ε(N ) is due to Lemma 3.5. It follows from this that

[L1 ∩ K ur

1 : K1] =

[L1 : K1]
[L1 : LI

1] ≥

p2r

p2(s(N )+δ2)+ε(N ) = 22(r−s(N )−δ2)−ε(N ).

(10)

This completes a proof of Theorem 1.1.

5 L1 ∩ K∞ = K1 for p = 2
Let the notations be the same as in §2. Put N1 := L1 ∩ K∞. In this section, we
prove N1 = K1 when p = 2.
Put Hn := 1 + pnM2(Zp) for any n ≥ 1. It is isomorphic to Gal(K∞/Kn)
since Gn ≃ GL2(Z/pnZ). Contrary to the case where p is odd, we have the issues
that the equality H 2
1 = H2 does not hold and H1/H2 ≃ M2(Z/2Z) contains E[2]
as an irreducible G1-quotient. To obtain a similar result we need more careful
analysis.

We have

1 we consider the subgroup H of H1 generated by H 2

5.1 Maximal abelian extension of K1 in K∞
Instead of H 2
1 . It is easy
to see that H is a normal subgroup of H1 (and also of GL2(Z2)). Since H1/H
is of exponent two, H1/H is an abelian group.
H2 ⊃ H ⊃ H3

since √h is in H1 for any h in H3 = 1 + 8M2(Z2), where √h is a solution (if it
exists) of the equation X 2 = h in M2(Z2). One can also check H3 is a normal
subgroup of H.
Lemma 5.1. It holds that

(1)

H/H3 =(I2 + 4(cid:18)a b

c a(cid:19) mod 8(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

a, b, c ∈ Z) ≃ (Z/2Z)3,

(2) H1/H is naturally identiﬁed with

{I2 + A mod 8}a((I2 + A) I2 + 4(cid:18)1 0
(3) H1/H is of order two and it is generated by I2 + 4(cid:18)1

where A runs over all elements in M2(Z),

0

0 0(cid:19)! mod 8),

0

0(cid:19) mod 8, and

(4) H1/H ≃ H2/H × H1/H2.
Proof. The ﬁrst three claims are easily obtained by direct computation and so
details are omitted. For (4), let us consider the following exact sequence:

1 → H2/H → H1/H → H1/H2 → 1.

10

By (2) it turns out that the map H1/H2 ≃ 2M2(Z/4Z) → H1/H, A 7→ I2 +
A mod 8 gives a splitting. Further the image of H1/H2 under the splitting and
H2/H are commutative in H1/H since

(I2 + 2A) I2 + 4(cid:18)1 0

0 0(cid:19)! ≡ I2 + 4(cid:18)1

0

0

0(cid:19)!(I2 + 2A) mod 8.

Since Gal(N1/K1) is of exponent 2, we have

H1 ⊃ Gal(K∞/N1) ⊃ H.

It implies the ﬁeld extension K1 ⊂ N1 ⊂ L, where L is the Galois extension
of K1 corresponding to H. By Lemma 5.1 (4), G1 = Gal(K1/Q) naturally
acts on Gal(L/K1) and the natural surjection Gal(L/K1) → Gal(N1/K1) is
G1-equivariant. Since G1 acts trivially on H2/H by Lemma 5.1 (2), N1 is
contained in K2.
As in the proof of Lemma 2.2 of [12], G1-module Gal(N1/K1) is isomorphic
to a copy of the irreducible G1-module E[2]. Therefore the above surjection
induces G1-equivariant, surjective homomorphism

M2(Z/2Z) ≃ H1/H2 = Gal(K2/K1) → Gal(N1/K1),

(11)

where G1 acts on M2(Z/2Z) by the matrix conjugate via G1 ≃ GL2(Z/2Z).
With this observation we study the GL2(Z/2Z)-module M2(Z/2Z) as below.

Lemma 5.2. There are exactly four non-trivial GL2(Z/2Z)-submodules of V4 :=
M2(Z/2Z) and they are given by

V1 = h(cid:18)1 0
0 1(cid:19)i, V (1)
2 = h(cid:18)0
1(cid:19) , (cid:18)1 1
and V3 = M2(Z/2Z)tr=0. Further only isotypic G1-quotient modules of M2(Z/2Z)
are V4/V3 ≃ Z/2Z, V (1)
2 /V1 ≃ Z/2Z and V (2)
Proof. Since GL2(Z/2Z) is generated by(cid:18)0

1 0(cid:19)i, V (2)
2 = h(cid:18)1 1
2 ≃ (Z/2Z)⊕2.

1(cid:19), we have only to

0 1(cid:19) , (cid:18)1 0

compute the orbit decomposition of M2(Z/2Z) under the actions of these two
elements.

5.2 A generator for K1

We take a Weierstrass model

y2 = x3 + ax + b = (x − e1)(x − e2)(x − e3)

over Q of E. Then we have

∆ ≡ (e1 − e2)2(e2 − e3)2(e3 − e1)2 mod Q∗12.

(12)

By G1 ≃ GL2(Z/2Z) ≃ S3, we have

√∆ ∈ K1, [Q(√∆) : Q] = 2.

4√∆ ∈ K2.

[K1( 4√∆) : K1] = 2.

Thus by (12) we have

Furthermore we see

Indeed, if 4√∆ is in K1, then [Q( 4√∆) : Q] = 4 and it contradicts to G1 ≃ S3.
Indeed, if ζ4 is in K1Cthen G2 ֒→ SL2(Z/4Z) and it
4√∆ is in K1Cthen [Q( 4√∆) : Q] = 4

By using the Weil pairing, we see ζ4 ∈ K2.
We have ζ4 /∈ K1.

Now we have the following Lemma.

5.3 A generator for K2
Suppose Gal(N1/K1) ≃ E[2]. Since N1/K1 is an abelian extension, N1 is con-
tained in the ﬁxed ﬁeld of H. Since N1/K1 is a G1-extension contained in
L1/K1, the Galois group Gal(N1/K1) is isomorphic to the direct product of
some copies of E[2]. As we see after Lemma 5.1, N1 is contained in K2. We
have

Furthermore, by using Lemma 5.2, Gal(N1/K1) is isomorphic to V (2)

the Galois group Gal(K2/N1) is isomorphic to V (1)

N1 = L1 ∩ K2.

(13)

. Then

We have ζ4 /∈ N1. Indeed, suppose ζ4 ∈ N1. Then K1 ⊂ K1(ζ4) ⊂ N1. Since
Gal(N1/K1(ζ4)) and Gal(K1(ζ4)/K1) are G1-submodules of Gal(N1/K1). This
contradicts to the assumption that Gal(N1/K1) is isomorphic to an irreducible
G1-module E[2].

4√∆ /∈ N1). Indeed, if 4√∆ ∈ N1 (resp.
Similarly, we have 4√∆ /∈ N1 (resp. ζ4
4√∆ ∈ N1), ζ4 is in the Galois closure of K1( 4√∆) (resp. K1(ζ4
4√∆)) over Q
ζ4
and it contradicts ζ4 /∈ N1.
Since K2 ⊃ N1(ζ4, 4√∆) ⊃ N1 and [N1(ζ4, 4√∆) : N1] = 4, we have K2 =
N1(ζ4, 4√∆) by the assumption [N1 : K1] = 4.

Now we have the following lemma.

Lemma 5.4. Assume that Gn ≃ GL2(Z/2nZ) for n = 1, 2 and that Gal(N1/K1) ≃
E[2]. Then we have K2 = N1( 4√∆, ζ4).

5.4 Generators for K1 and K2
Since E has multiplicative reduction, there exists some q in 2Z2 such that E
is isomorphic to the Tate curve Eq over the unramiﬁed extension M of Q2 for
M = Q2, Q2(√−3). We also have

M(Eq[2]) = M(√q), M(Eq[4]) = M( 4√q, ζ4).
(14)
Since ord2(q) is odd, Q2(√q)/Q2 is a totally ramiﬁed extension of degree two.
Q2( 4√q, ζ4)/Q2 is a totally ramiﬁed extension of degree eight.

degree at most four, and its ramiﬁcation index is at most two.

At ﬁrst, we discuss about K1 = Q2(E[2]).
Since M/Q2 is a quadratic unramiﬁed extension, the extension K1/Q2 is of
By assumption, ord2(∆) = ord2(q) is odd. Thus Q2(√∆)/Q2 is a totally
ramiﬁed quadratic extension. Since the Galois group Gal(K1/Q2) is isomorphic
to a subgroup G1 ≃ S3 and it contains normal subgroup Gal(K1/Q2(√∆)) of
order two. Thus we have

and

[K1 : Q2] = 2
K1 = Q2(√∆).

of degree at most sixteen, and its ramiﬁcation index is at most eight.

Secondly, we discuss about K2 = Q2(E[4]). By (14) the extension K2/Q2 is
Since ord2(∆) = ord2(q) is odd, Q2( 4√∆, ζ4)/Q2 is a totally ramiﬁed ex-
tension of degree eight. Thus K2/Q2( 4√∆, ζ4) is an unramiﬁed extension of
degree at most two. In the case of [K2 : Q2( 4√∆, ζ4)] = 2, the Galois group
Gal(K2/Q2) contains the inertia group as a normal subgroup of order eight and
thus K2 contains the unramiﬁed quadratic extension M of Q2. We have

K2 = M( 4√∆, ζ4).

Now we have the following lemma.

Lemma 5.5. Assume that Gn ≃ GL2(Z/2nZ) for n = 1, 2. Then we have

K2 = Q2( 4√∆, ζ4), Q2( 4√∆, ζ4,√−3).

5.5 The proof of N1 = K1
We show N1 = K1. Since K2/Q2N1 is a totally ramiﬁed extension of degree
four, we have

K2 = Q2N1( 4√∆, ζ4).

On the other hand, we have

Q2N1 = K1, K1(√−3).

We take an element σ in Gal(K2/N1) such that

4√∆ 7→ − 4√∆, ζ4 7→ ζ4.

Since K2/Q2N1 is a totally ramiﬁed extension, we may consider σ in Gal(K2/N1Q2).

13

Since either √−3 /∈ K2, or √−3 ∈ Q2N1 holdsC we may enlarge σ from

Gal(K2/Q2N1) to Gal(MK2/Q2N1) satisfying
σ(√−3) = √−3.

Since the ﬁxed ﬁeld of σ in MK2 is M(ζ4,√∆), we have σ( 4√q) = − 4√q.
tation of σ with respect to E[4] is equal to that with respect to Eq[4] = hζ4, 4√qi

Thus σ commutes with the isomorphism from E to Eq. The matrix represen-

and it is conjugate to

This contradicts to

0 0(cid:21) .
Gal(K2/N1) ≃ V (1)

by the assumption Gal(N1/K1) ≃ V (2)

.
Now we have the following theorem.

Theorem 5.6. The equality N1 = K1 holds for p = 2.

6 Examples

In this section we will give elliptic curves which satisfy the condition in Theorem
1.1. The computation is done by using Mathematica, version 10 and a database
of Sage [11] for elliptic curves over Q.

p = 2 and δ2 = 1

6.1
Let E be the elliptic curve deﬁned by y2 + xy + y = x3 − 141x + 624. This
elliptic curve has the conductor N = 2 · 712 = 10082, the minimal discriminant
∆ = 23 · 713, and j-invariant 2−3 · 53 · 193. By the criterion of [3] one can check
that Gn ≃ GL2(Z/2nZ) for any n ≥ 1 since 4t3(t + 1) + j = 0 does not have
a rational solution in t. By [11] we see that E(Q) ≃ Z2 and it is generated by
P1 = (−6, 38) and P2 = (6,−1).
We apply Theorem 1.1 to E for p = 2 with s(N ) = 1, ε(N ) = 1. Then we
have κn ≥ 2n(2 − 1) − 2 = 2(n− 1) for n ≥ 2. Hence the class number hQ(E[2n])
satisﬁes

for any n ≥ 2. In this case we can check ζ4 = √−1 ∈ L1 and thus we can not

remove the defect δ2 with our results.

22(n−1) | hQ(E[2n])

6.2

p = 2 and δ2 = 0

Let E be the elliptic curve deﬁned by

h(x, y) := −(y2 + xy + y) + x3 − x2 − 1049x + 13817 = 0.

This elliptic curve has the conductor N = 2 · 32 · 472 = 39762, the minimal
discriminant ∆ = −27 · 39 · 472, and j-invariant −2−7 · 3−3 · 73 · 173 · 47. Further
it has split multiplicative reduction at p = 2.

14

Similarly one can check that Gn ≃ GL2(Z/2nZ) for any n ≥ 1. By [11] we
see that E(Q) ≃ Z2 and it is generated by P1 = (−33, 124) and P2 = (21, 16).
A direct computation shows that L1 is obtained by adding the roots of the
following two equations to K1:

f (x) = x4 + 132x3 + 1998x2 − 248940x + 2964681,
g(x) = x4 − 84x3 + 2160x2 − 22464x − 19845.

These polynomials are obtained as follows. Firstly we compute

2P = (f1(x, y), g1(x, y)), f1, g1 ∈ Q(x, y)

for P = (x, y). For P1 = (−33, 124), we have the system of algebraic equations

f1(x, y) = −33, g1(x, y) = 124, h(x, y) = 0.

By deleting y we obtain f (x) as a unique common factor. Similarly we obtain
g(x) from P2.

Since E has split multiplicative reduction at p = 2, we have M = Q2. By

using [7] we see that

K1 = Q2(√−6), L1 = Q2(√−6,√3,√−2) = K1(√3).

Therefore ζ4 = √−1 6∈ L1 and hence δ2 = 0.
We now apply Theorem 1.1 to E for p = 2 with s(N ) = 1, ε(N ) = 1, and
δ2 = 0. Then we have κn ≥ 2n(2− 1) = 2n for n ≥ 2 and κ1 ≥ 2(2− 1)− 1 = 1.
Hence the class number hQ(E[2n]) satisﬁes

2 | hQ(E[2]) and 22n | hQ(E[2n]) (n ≥ 2).

6.3

p = 3

Let E be the elliptic curve deﬁned by y2 + xy = x3 + 543x + 10026. This elliptic
curve has the conductor N = 3 · 672 = 13467, the minimal discriminant ∆ =
−311 · 673, and j-invariant 3−11 · 3893. By [11] we see that G1 ≃ Gal(Z/3Z) and
E(Q) ≃ Z2 whose generators are given by P1 = (−13, 35) and P2 = (39, 282).
Then we can apply the criterion of [4] (see also the j-invariant in p. 961 of [3])
for G2 to obtain G2 ≃ GL2(Z/32Z). Therefore the conditions in Theorem 1.1
for E is fulﬁlled. Thus we have κn ≥ 2n(2 − 1) = 2n. Hence the class number
hQ(E[3n]) satisﬁes

32n | hQ(E[3n])

for each n ≥ 1.
