Abstract

The classical system of shallow-water (Saint–Venant) equations describes long surface waves
in an inviscid incompressible ﬂuid of a variable depth. Although shock waves are expected in
this quasilinear hyperbolic system for a wide class of initial data, we ﬁnd a suﬃcient condition
on the initial data that guarantees existence of a global classical solution continued from a local
solution. The suﬃcient conditions can be easily satisﬁed for the ﬂuid ﬂow propagating in one
direction with two characteristic velocities of the same sign and two monotonically increasing
Riemann invariants. We prove that these properties persist in the time evolution of the classical
solutions to the shallow-water equations and provide no shock wave singularities formed in a
ﬁnite time over a half-line or an inﬁnite line. On a technical side, we develop a novel method
of an additional argument, which allows to obtain local and global solutions to the quasilinear
hyperbolic systems in physical rather than characteristic variables.

Introduction

The shallow water system arises in the dispersionless limit of Euler equations and describes long
waves on the surface of an inviscid incompressible ﬂuid (e.g., water). We assume that the surface
waves are two-dimensional in the (x, z)-variables and that the ﬂuid is located between the hard
bottom of the varying depth at z = −h(x) and the free surface at z = η(t, x), where h is given and
η is unknown.

In the case of surface waves free of vorticity, the velocity vector of the ﬂuid’s motion is given by
the gradient of the velocity potential, which is found from the Laplace equation in variables (x, z).
In the dispersionless limit, for which the horizontal length of wave motion is much larger compared
to the vertical length, the Euler equations reduce to the shallow water system

(cid:26) ∂tη + ∂x [u(h(x) + η)] = 0,

∂tu + u∂xu + g∂xη = 0,

(1.1)

where u(t, x) is the horizontal component of velocity at the free surface z = η(t, x), and g is the
gravitational constant. In what follows, we set g = 1 without loss of generality.

The shallow water system (1.1), which is also known as the Saint–Venant equations, is reviewed
in many texts and monographs (see, e.g., Section 5.1.1 in [13]). Recently, interest to the shallow-
water system arises due to modeling of run-up of water waves towards the beach [6]. In particular,
when the bottom topography changes like h(x) ∼ x4/3, the waves propagating towards the beach
are free of reﬂections [5].

Using the standard technique of Riemann invariants, one can diagonalize the quasilinear system

(1.1) in new coordinates

z±(t, x) := u(t, x) ± 2ph(x) + η(t, x),

which are real if h(x) + η(t, x) > 0. This constraint corresponds to the hyperbolicity of the shallow-
water system (1.1) and, physically, to the nonzero depth of the ﬂuid ﬂow over the variable bottom.
Substitution of (1.2) into (1.1) yields the system of symmetric quasilinear equations

∂tz− + 1

4 (3z+ + z−)∂xz+ = h′(x),
4 (z+ + 3z−)∂xz− = h′(x).

The characteristic speeds of the system (1.3) are given by

c± :=

1
4

(3z± + z∓) = u ±ph(x) + η.

System (1.3) in Riemann invariants is well-known, see, e.g., Sections 5.7 and 13.10 in [18]. Some
explicit solutions can be obtained in the case h′(x) = const by using the hodograph transformation
method, see, e.g., recent works [6, 17] and references therein. Review of exact solutions to the
shallow water system can be found in Section 16.2.1 in [15].

The Cauchy problem is posed for the system (1.3) with initial data

z±(0, x) = ϕ±(x).

(1.5)

If the initial data ϕ± are deﬁned on the inﬁnite line in Sobolev spaces H s(R), then the Cauchy
problem (1.3) and (1.5) is known to be locally well-posed for s > 3
2 [11]. The method of character-
istics can be used in a local neighborhood of any point if the initial data ϕ± are C 1 functions near
this point and their ﬁrst derivatives are Lipschitz continuous [3].

It is easy to recover the solution (u, η) to the shallow-water system (1.1) from the solution (z+, z−)

to the system (1.3). Indeed, inverting (1.2) yields

u(t, x) =

1
2

[z+(t, x) + z−(t, x)] ,

η(t, x) =

1
16

[z+(t, x) − z−(t, x)]2 − h(x).

The initial data for u and η are given by

u0(x) =

1
2

[ϕ+(x) + ϕ−(x)] ,

η0(x) =

1
16

[ϕ+(x) − ϕ−(x)]2 − h(x),

(1.6)

(1.7)

where positivity of h(x) + η0(x) > 0 is assumed for every x.

For most quasilinear systems, local solutions in Sobolev spaces H s(R) are not continued for all
times t because wave breaking occurs in a ﬁnite time, resulting in appearance of the shock waves
[4]. However, depending on the initial values ϕ± and the given proﬁle h, the wave breaking may

2

be avoided and the local solutions can be continued for all ﬁnite times. We term such solutions as
global solutions and warn that these solutions are allowed to diverge in some norm as t → ∞.

This paper is devoted to the solvability of the classical system (1.3) both locally and globally.
We will consider the semi-inﬁnite line [0,∞) for x. Generally speaking, a boundary condition is
required at the ﬁnite boundary x = 0 for all positive times t > 0. However, if we ﬁnd a condition
on the initial values ϕ± and the given proﬁle h which ensure that both characteristic speeds c± in
(1.4) are negative near x = 0 for all t > 0, then we can avoid setting boundary conditions at x = 0.
This is the key ingredient of the method of an additional argument, which we develop in this work.
Moreover, with additional constraints on ϕ± and h, one can also continue classical solutions to the
shallow-water system (1.1) globally in time and thus avoid wave breaking.

The novel method of an additional argument was pioneered for scalar conservation laws in [8, 9]
and for systems of conservation laws in [1, 10]. This method allows us to avoid technical problems
arising in other techniques such as the method of characteristics or the method of generalized
solutions [16]. For instance, the solvability condition in the method of characteristics relies on
invertibility of the characteristic variables, which may be diﬃcult to prove. Compared to the
method of characteristics, the method of an additional argument allows us to obtain the local and
global solvability of the quasilinear system directly in physical coordinates.

In what follows, for a given T > 0, we use notation

ΩT := {(t, x) :

t ∈ (0, T ), x ∈ R+},

for the domain of deﬁnition of the Cauchy problem associated with the system (1.3). We denote
by C 1,1(ΩT ) the space of bounded functions of two variables in ΩT , which are continuously diﬀer-
entiable both in t and x with bounded ﬁrst derivatives. We also introduce the norm in the space
of functions C n

b (R+) with bounded and continuous derivatives up to the n-th order:

khkC n

x∈R+ |h(x)| +

Then, for every T > 0, there exists a unique classical solution u, η ∈ C 1,1(ΩT ) to the shallow-water
system (1.1) such that u|t=0 = u0 and η|t=0 = η0.

Remark 1 It follows from the deﬁnition (1.2) for Riemann invariants that conditions (1.9) are
satisﬁed if

Similarly, condition (1.12) is satisﬁed if

ϕ+(x) ≤ 0, ϕ−(x) ≤ 0,

x ∈ R+.

(1.13)

(1.14)

Remark 2 Since the quasilinear system (1.3) is written in the symmetric form, the result of The-
orem 1 agrees with the result of Kato [11] on the inﬁnite line, since Sobolev space H s(R) with s > 3
2
is continuously embedded into the space C 1
b (R). However, the Cauchy problem (1.3) and (1.5) on
the half-line cannot be solved by the method of Kato [11] unless a boundary condition is set at x = 0
in one way or another.

Remark 3 The result of Theorem 1 is stronger than the corresponding result of Courant and Lax
[3], which establish the existence of classical solutions with Lipschitz continuity for their spatial
derivatives in a local neighborhood of any point x on R+, provided the initial data are available
near this point. Although the formulations of the method of characteristics in [3] and the method
of an additional argument here are similar, our technique allows us to obtain the solution to the
quasilinear system (1.3) in physical rather than characteristic coordinates. Also we obtain a stronger
result by using the Schauder ﬁxed point theorem (see Lemma 2 below) instead of the Arzel´a–Ascoli
theorem on convergence of bounded and equicontinuous sequences for spatial derivatives.

The alternative of the global existence in Theorem 2 is the wave breaking in a ﬁnite time, which
happens when the shock waves are formed in the quasilinear hyperbolic systems [4]. We note
that the wave breaking can also occur in the presence of weak dispersion, if the initial data are
suﬃciently large in some norm [7, 14].

The physical relevance of the conditions (1.8), (1.9), (1.11), and (1.12) is to provide the bottom
topography h and the initial values for u and η such that both the Riemann invariants z± and
their characteristic speeds c± given by (1.2) and (1.4) are strictly negative, whereas the Riemann
invariants are monotonically increasing, see (1.13) and (1.14). Under these conditions, the surface
waves do not break in a ﬁnite time, because they move convectively to the ﬁnite boundary at x = 0,
through which they radiate away. These conditions can be satisﬁed, for instance, if

h(x) = (1 + x)−p,

η0(x) = C,

u0(x) = −2pC + h(x),

(1.15)

4

where p > 0 and C > 0 are ﬁxed. Thus, the bottom topography becomes deeper near x = 0 and
uniform as x → ∞, whereas the initial horizontal velocity is negative everywhere and the current
is stronger near x = 0 and becomes uniform as x → ∞. Such conﬁgurations can model river
waterfalls, e.g., Niagara falls in Ontario, Canada.

Theorems 1 and 2 can be extended to the inﬁnite line without any restrictions, as long as the
conditions (1.8), (1.9), (1.11), and (1.12) hold on the inﬁnite line. The main example (1.15) does
not make sense on the inﬁnite line, but the conditions can be satisﬁed for the shear ﬂow on the ﬂat
bottom with sign-deﬁnite, monotonically increasing velocity u0, which may vanish at one inﬁnity
but has a non-vanishing background ﬂow at the other inﬁnity.

In a single wave reduction of the system (1.3) with h′(x) ≡ 0 and z+(t, x) ≡ 0, the constraint

(1.12) guarantees that

ϕ′
−(x) = u′

0(x) −

η′
0(x)

ph + η0(x) ≥ 0,

x ∈ R+.

This condition is well known [4] to exclude shock waves in the Cauchy problem posed for the inviscid
Burgers equation

(cid:26) ∂tz− + 3
z−|t=0 = ϕ−.

4 z−∂xz− = 0,

(1.16)

In the same context, the constraint (1.9) ensures that ϕ−(x) ≤ 0 for every x ∈ R+, the latter
constraint is only required to avoid the boundary condition on z− at x = 0 for the evolution
problem (1.16) on the semi-inﬁnite line R+.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the reformulation of the
quasilinear system (1.3) as a system of integral equations by using the method of an additional ar-
gument. The equivalence between the quasilinear system (1.3) and the system of integral equations
is established. In Section 3, we obtain a local solution of Theorem 1. In Section 4, we show that
the local solution in C 1,1(ΩT ) can be extended for every T > 0 as in Theorem 2. The additional
constraints (1.11) and (1.12) allow us to control the rate of change of the spatial derivatives of the
solution z± during the time evolution of the quasilinear system (1.3).

2 Reformulation with the method of an additional argument

Here we adopt the method of an additional argument in order to reformulate the Cauchy problem
given by (1.3) and (1.5) as a boundary-value problem along characteristic coordinates. For a given
point (t, x) ∈ ΩT , we introduce the extended characteristic coordinates η+(s; t, x) and η−(s; t, x)
from solutions to the system of diﬀerential equations

( dη+

ds (s; t, x) = 1
dη−
ds (s; t, x) = 1

4 [3z+(s, η+(s; t, x)) + z−(s, η+(s; t, x))] ,
4 [z+(s, η−(s; t, x)) + 3z−(s, η−(s; t, x))] ,

0 ≤ s ≤ t,

(2.1)

starting with the boundary values η±(t; t, x) = x. In the characteristic variables, the system (1.3)
can be rewritten as the system of diﬀerential equations

( dz+

ds (s, η+(s; t, x)) = h′(η+(s; t, x)),
dz−
ds (s, η−(s; t, x)) = h′(η−(s; t, x)),

0 ≤ s ≤ t,

(2.2)

5

starting with the initial values z±(0, η±(0; t, x)) = ϕ±(η±(0; t, x)). The domain of deﬁnition of the
systems (2.1) and (2.2) is given by

ΓT :=(cid:8)(s, t, x) :

0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ T,

x ∈ R+(cid:9) ,

(2.3)

for a given T > 0. We denote by C k,k,m(ΓT ) the space of bounded functions of three variables
in ΓT , which are diﬀerentiable k-times with respect to s and t, m-times with respect to x, with
bounded derivatives. We also denote the supremum norm of a function U ∈ C 0,0,0(ΓT ) by

kUk := sup

(s,t,x)∈ΓT |U (s; t, x)|.

(2.4)

The variable s is referred to as the additional argument of the system (2.1) and (2.2). The main
diﬀerence of the method of an additional argument from the method of characteristics is that the
system (2.1) is integrated backward in s from the current time t to the initial time 0, whereas the
system (2.2) is integrated forward in s from the initial time 0 to the current time t. Although
the combined system (2.1) and (2.2) represents a boundary-value problem instead of the Cauchy
problem, we are still able to rewrite the systems (2.1) and (2.2) as a system of integral equations and
to solve it by the Picard method of successful iterations. Compared to the method of characteristics,
the solutions z±(t, x) ≡ z±(t, η±(t; t, x)) appear in physical rather than characteristic coordinates.

2.1

Integral equations for classical solutions of system (1.3)

Integrating (2.1) backward in s, we obtain the system of integral equations

( η+(s; t, x) = x − 1
4R t
4R t
η−(s; t, x) = x − 1

s [3z+(ν, η+(ν; t, x)) + z−(ν, η+(ν; t, x))] dν,
s [z+(ν, η−(ν; t, x)) + 3z−(ν, η−(ν; t, x))] dν,

0 ≤ s ≤ t.

(2.5)

Integrating (2.2) forward in s, we obtain another system of integral equations

(cid:26) z+(s, η+(s; t, x)) = ϕ+(η+(0; t, x)) +R s
z−(s, η−(s; t, x)) = ϕ−(η−(0; t, x)) +R s

0 h′(η+(ν; t, x)))dν,
0 h′(η−(ν; t, x)))dν,

0 ≤ s ≤ t,

(2.6)

From the geometric deﬁnition of the characteristic curves in the domain ΩT on the (t, x) plane, we
have the connection formulas

(cid:26) z−(s, η+(s; t, x)) = z−(s, η−(s; s, η+(s; t, x))),

z+(s, η−(s; t, x)) = z+(s, η+(s; s, η−(s; t, x))),

0 ≤ s ≤ t.

(2.7)

Let us denote

Z±(s; t, x) := z±(s, η±(s; t, x))

and Y±(s; t, x) := z∓(s, η±(s; t, x)).

(2.8)

It follows from the boundary conditions η±(t; t, x) = x that Z±(t; t, x) = z±(t, x) and Y±(t; t, x) =
z∓(t, x). Furthermore, equations (2.7) are equivalent to the following relations between variables
Z± and Y±:

Y+(s; t, x) = Z−(s; s, η+(s; t, x)),

Y−(s; t, x) = Z+(s; s, η−(s; t, x)).

(2.9)

6

From now on, we will be writing systems by using one equation with two subscripts. By using new
notations, we rewrite system (2.5) in the following form

η±(s; t, x) = x −

4Z t

s

[3Z±(ν; t, x) + Y±(ν; t, x)] dν,

0 ≤ s ≤ t.

(2.10)

Therefore, the characteristic coordinates can be eliminated from the systems (2.6) and (2.9), after
which we obtain the following integral equations for unknown functions Z± and Y± in ΓT :

(2.12)

Our ﬁrst result states that the system of integral equations (2.11)–(2.12) is closed in ΓT for every

T > 0 under conditions (1.8) and (1.13) on h and ϕ±.

Proposition 1 Assume that h ∈ C 1

b (R+). Under the conditions

h′(x) 6 0, ϕ+(x) ≤ 0, ϕ−(x) ≤ 0,

x ∈ R+,

(2.13)

the system of integral equations (2.11)–(2.12) is closed in ΓT for every T > 0 in the sense that if
a unique solution (Z±, Y±) exists in C 0,0,0(ΓT ), then

η±(s; t, x) ≥ 0,
Z±(s; t, x) ≤ 0,
Y±(s; t, x) ≤ 0,




(s, t, x) ∈ ΓT .

(2.14)

Proof. We obtain from (2.10), (2.11), and (2.12) for every (s, t, x) ∈ ΓT ,

η±(s; t, x) ≥ x, Z±(s; t, x) ≤ ϕ±(η±(0; t, x)) ≤ 0,

Y±(s; t, x) = Z∓(s; s, η±(s; t, x)) ≤ 0,
by using conditions (2.13) and the continuation arguments. Then, constraints (2.14) follow.

(cid:3)

Next, we show how the classical solutions to the Cauchy problem (1.3) and (1.5) are obtained

from suitable solutions to the integral system (2.11)–(2.12).

Proposition 2 Assume that h ∈ C 2
b (R+). If there exists a unique solution
(Z±, Y±) ∈ C 1,1,1(ΓT ) of the system of integral equations (2.11)–(2.12), then z±(t, x) = Z±(t; t, x)
is a classical solution to system (1.3) in C 1,1(ΩT ) such that z±(0, x) = ϕ±(x) for x ∈ R+.

Applying W+ to the corresponding integral equation in the system (2.11) and using Y+(t; t, x) =

where the arguments of ϕ′
between Y+ and Z− from the system (2.12), we obtain similarly

we obtain the following estimate

Then, for every t ∈ [0, t+] with t+ := min(T+, T ), we obtain

kW+Z+k + kW+Y+k = 0,

which imply W+Z+ = W+Y+ = 0 in Γt+.

Applying W− to the corresponding integral equations into the system (2.11) and (2.12), we obtain

which imply W−Z− = W−Y− = 0 in Γt−.

Let z±(t, x) := Z±(t; t, x) and T0 := min(T+, T−, T ). Then, for every t ∈ [0, T0], we use

T0 ≤ T . If T0 < T , then the continuation of the solution to the entire domain ΩT can be performed
in a ﬁnite number of steps.

Let us denote u±(t, x) := ∂xz±(t, x). If z± ∈ C 1,1(ΩT ) as in Proposition 2, then u± ∈ C 0,0(ΩT ).
Diﬀerentiating (2.5) with respect to x, we obtain a system of integral equations for x-derivatives of
the characteristic coordinates:

ξ±(s; t, x) = 1 −

0 ≤ s ≤ t,

(2.15)

where ξ±(s; t, x) := ∂xη±(s; t, x) satisﬁes the initial conditions ξ±(t; t, x) = 1. There exists a unique
solution of the system of integral equations (2.15) in the form

ξ±(s; t, x) = e− 1

4 R t

s [3u±(ν,η±(ν;t,x))+u∓(ν,η±(ν;t,x))]dν ,

0 ≤ s ≤ t.

(2.16)

The main diﬃculty in the method of characteristics is to control positivity of ξ±(s; t, x) in ΓT as
T increases. The explicit expression (2.16) shows that positivity of ξ±(s; t, x) in ΓT follows from
boundness of u±(t, x) in ΩT , but this property is hard to control. On the other hand, in the method
of an additional argument, we introduce

U±(s; t, x) := ∂xZ±(s; t, x),

V±(s; t, x) := ∂xY±(s; t, x)

(2.17)

and deﬁne by using (2.8) and the chain rule

U±(s; t, x) = u±(s, η±(s; t, x))ξ±(s; t, x),

V±(s; t, x) = u∓(s, η±(s; t, x))ξ±(s; t, x).

(2.18)

It follows from the boundary conditions η±(t; t, x) = x and ξ±(t; t, x) = 1 that U±(t; t, x) = u±(t, x)
and V±(t; t, x) = u∓(t, x). If (Z±, Y±) ∈ C 1,1,1(ΓT ) as in Proposition 2, then (U±, V±) ∈ C 0,0,0(ΓT ).
By diﬀerentiating the system of integral equations (2.11) and (2.12) with respect to x, we obtain
the system of integral equations:

This relation is complementary to the expression (2.16).

The following proposition states that the variables U± and V± are sign-deﬁnite in ΓT for every
T > 0, for which a solution (Z±, Y±) ∈ C 1,1,1(Γ) exists, under additional conditions (1.11) and
(1.14) on h and ϕ±.

(2.22)

If a solution (Z±, Y±) to the system of integral equations (2.11)–(2.12) exists in C 1,1,1(ΓT ), then

ξ±(s; t, x) ≤ 1,
U±(s; t, x) ≥ 0,
V±(s; t, x) ≥ 0,




(s, t, x) ∈ ΓT .

(2.23)

Proof. Assuming existence of solution (Z±, Y±) ∈ C 1,1,1(ΓT ) to the system of integral equations
(2.11)–(2.12), we have by Proposition 2 and the deﬁnition (2.17) that (U±, V±) ∈ C 0,0,0(ΓT ) and
u± ∈ C 0,0(ΩT ). By (2.16), we have ξ±(s; t, x) > 0 for every (s, t, x) ∈ ΓT . Then, by using relations
(2.21), conditions (2.22), and the result of Proposition 1, we obtain from the system (2.19) and
(2.20) that U±(s; t, x) ≥ 0 and V±(s; t, x) ≥ 0 for every (s, t, x) ∈ ΓT . Using relations (2.21) again,
we have ξ±(s; t, x) ≤ 1 for every (s, t, x) ∈ ΓT . Thus, constraints (2.23) have been proved.

(cid:3)

Generally speaking, the chain rule (2.18) and the representation (2.21) only show that if U±(s; t, x)
and V±(s; t, x) remain bounded and positive for (s, t, x) ∈ ΓT , then ξ±(s; t, x) may still vanish at the
same points (s, t, x) ∈ ΓT for which either u±(s, η±(s; t, x)) or u∓(s, η±(s; t, x)) become unbounded.
However, divergence of u±(t, x) for (t, x) ∈ ΩT contradicts to the result of Proposition 2, if the
solution (Z±, Y±) ∈ C 1,1,1(ΓT ) to the system of integral equations (2.11)–(2.12) is obtained. There-
fore, the essence of the method of an additional argument is to ensure solvability of the system of
integral equations (2.11)–(2.12) in C 1,1,1(ΓT ), which would guarantee strict positivity of ξ±(s; t, x)
for every (s, t, x) ∈ ΓT .

For completeness, we mention that if we substitute (2.16), (2.18) and (2.21) to the integral

equations (2.19), then we obtain

consistency conditions u∓(s, η±(s; t, x)) = u∓(s, η∓(s; s, η±(s; s, x))). The diﬀerential system (2.25)
can be derived by diﬀerentiating system (1.3) with respect to x for appropriate solutions z± ∈
C 2,2(ΩT ) and using the characteristic equations (2.1). Again, control of boundness of u±(t, x) for
(t, x) ∈ ΩT is very diﬃcult within the evolution problem (2.25) or the system of integral equations
(2.24). However, all these diﬃcult steps are avoided in the method of an additional argument.

(2.25)

3 Local solution to system (2.11)–(2.12)

Here we use the method of Picard’s successive approximations to prove existence of a local solution
to the system of integral equations (2.11)–(2.12). At ﬁrst, we are looking for local solutions in
the space C 0,0,0(ΓT ). The ﬁxed existence time T > 0 is supposed to be small to ensure that
the contraction method works. Then, we obtain local solutions in the space C 1,1,1(ΓT ) from the
Schauder ﬁxed-point theorem. Assumptions of both Propositions 1 and 2 are satisﬁed for the
local solutions in C 1,1,1(ΓT ). Thus, by correspondence between solutions to the system of integral
equations (2.11)–(2.12) and the quasilinear system (1.3), the results obtained in this section yield
the proof of Theorem 1.

The main diﬃculty in the proof of existence of a local solution to the system of integral equations
(2.11)–(2.12) in C 0,0,0(ΓT ) is due to the fact that the integral equation (2.12) is composed of
unknown functions. As a result, the method of successive approximations consists of two levels,
similar to what is described in [10]. In order to close the system of integral equations (2.11)–(2.12)
in ΓT , we use the conditions (1.8) and (1.9) on the function h and initial data u0 and η0, the latter
conditions are rewritten for ϕ± in the form (1.13).

(3.2)

Proof. By Proposition 1, the system of integral equations (2.11)–(2.12) is closed in ΓT in the sense
of bounds (2.14). In order to apply the Picard method, we start with the initial approximations

Z±(0)(s; t, x) = Y±(0)(s; t, x) = ϕ±(x)

(3.3)

and deﬁne the successive approximations {Z±(n), Y±(n)}n∈N from the recursive iterations based on
the system of integral equations (2.11)–(2.12) for n ∈ N:

The construction of successive approximations to the two-level system in C 0,0,0(ΓT ) is broken into
three steps.

Step 1. We prove for every n ∈ N that the sequence {Z (k)

±(n), Y (k)

±(n)}k∈N satisfying (3.6), (3.7),

and (3.8) converges in C 0,0,0(ΓT ) for a ﬁxed T > 0 satisfying (3.1), so that we can deﬁne

kY (k)

±(n)k = kZ±(n−1)k,

k ∈ N,

(3.10)

where we have used ChT ≤ Cϕ according to the constraint (3.1). Since the bounds (3.10) are
independent of k, if convergence to the limits (3.9) can be proved for each n ∈ N, then by the
induction method, we have
(3.11)

kZ±(n)k,kY±(n)k ≤ 2Cϕ, n ∈ N.

12

Bounds (3.11) are also satisﬁed for n = 0. Now, we establish convergence to the limits in (3.9).

By using the fundamental theorem of calculus and the estimates similar to those in the proof of

Proposition 2, we derive the bounds on the distance between two successive approximations:

3kZ (k+1)

±(n) − Z (k)

±(n)k + kY (k+1)

k∂xY±(n−1)k ≤ 4Cϕ, n ∈ N,
which is satisﬁed at least for n = 1. It follows from (3.11) and (3.12) that

, according to the constraint (3.1). Hence, for each n ∈ N, the sequence {Z (k)

±(n), Y (k)

±(n)}k∈N

Taking the limit k → ∞ in the recursive system (3.7)–(3.8), we obtain the recursive system
(3.4)–(3.5) for (Z±(n), Y±(n)) in C 0,0,0(ΓT ). Therefore, (Z±(n), Y±(n)) is a local solution to the sys-
tem (3.4)–(3.5) for each n ∈ N that satisﬁes bounds (3.11). Moreover, from the contraction princi-
ple, it follows that the local solution to the system (3.4)–(3.5) is unique in C 0,0,0(ΓT ) for each n ∈ N.

Step 2. We prove that for each n ∈ N, the solution (Z±(n), Y±(n)) ∈ C 0,0,0(ΓT ) to the system
of integral equations (3.4)–(3.5) constructed in Step 1 belongs actually to C 0,0,1(ΓT ) and satisﬁes
the same bounds (3.14) as the previous approximation (Z±(n−1), Y±(n−1)). By diﬀerentiating the
system (3.4)–(3.5) with respect to x, we obtain a system of linear integral equations

where the arguments of ϕ′
recall that ϕ′
±, h′′ are continuous and by the method of induction, ∂xZ∓(n−1) is also taken to be
continuous, for each n ∈ N. Since (Z±(n), Y±(n)) ∈ C 0,0,0(ΓT ) is substituted in the arguments of
ϕ′
±, h′′, and ∂xZ∓(n−1), we know that the coeﬃcients of the system of linear integral equations
(3.17)–(3.18) are all continuous functions in ΓT .

We ﬁrst claim that there exists a unique solution of the system of linear integral equations

(3.17)–(3.18) in C 0,0,0(ΓT ). Indeed, let us rewrite the system in the form

are 0 and 9. If T Cϕ ≤ 1
15 , the norm induced by the perturbation P is strictly smaller than one.
Therefore, the matrix integral operator I + P is invertible and a unique solution (U±(n), V±(n)) to
the system of linear integral equations (3.17)–(3.18) exists in C 0,0,0(ΓT ).

Next, for every (s, t, x0) ∈ ΓT , we claim that the quotients

Z±(n)(s; t, x) − Z±(n)(s; t, x0)

and

Y±(n)(s; t, x) − Y±(n)(s; t, x0)

x − x0

x − x0

remain bounded as x → x0 for every x0 ∈ R+. This is shown by repeating the estimates for
the system of integral equations (3.4)–(3.5), where we are using the constraint on T in (3.1), and
the smoothness properties on ϕ±, h, and Z∓(n−1). Now, by repeating the estimates for bounded
functions

and

E±(n)(s; t, x, x0) :=

F±(n)(s; t, x, x0) :=

Z±(n)(s; t, x) − Z±(n)(s; t, x0)

x − x0

x − x0

− U±(n)(s; t, x0)

− V±(n)(s; t, x0)

and using uniqueness of solutions of the integral equations (3.4)–(3.5) and their ﬁrst variations
(3.17)–(3.18), we obtain for every (s, t, x0) ∈ ΓT that

lim
x→x0

E±(n)(s; t, x, x0) = 0 and

lim
x→x0

F±(n)(s; t, x, x0) = 0.

14

Therefore, (Z±(n), Y±(n)) are continuously diﬀerentiable with respect to x at every x0 ∈ R+ and

∂xZ±(n)(s; t, x) = U±(n)(s; t, x)

and ∂xY±(n)(s; t, x) = V±(n)(s; t, x),

(s, t, x) ∈ ΓT .

(3.20)

It remains to verify bounds (3.14) for (Z±(n), Y±(n)). It follows from the second line of (3.19)

k∂xY±(n)k ≤ 4Cϕ, n ∈ N.

The validity of the bounds (3.14) for every n ∈ N is veriﬁed by the induction method.

(3.22)

(3.23)

Step 3. We prove under the same constraint (3.1) on T that the sequence {Z±(n), Y±(n)}n∈N
deﬁned by the recursive system (3.4)–(3.5) converges in C 0,0,0(ΓT ) to the solution (Z±, Y±) ∈
C 0,0,0(ΓT ) satisfying the system of integral equations (2.11)–(2.12) and bound (3.2).

After the convergence to the limits (3.9) is proved, the index n in the system of integral equations
(3.4)–(3.5) can be incremented by one using the induction method. Convergence of iterations
{Z±(n), Y±(n)}n∈N can be considered in C 0,0,0(ΓT ) with standard methods.

It follows from (3.4) and (3.5) with the fundamental theorem of calculus that

Therefore, the iteration map deﬁned by the system (3.4)–(3.5) is a contraction in C 0,0,0(ΓT ). Hence,
the sequence {Z±(n), Y±(n)}n∈N is Cauchy in C 0,0,0(ΓT ) and it converges as n → ∞ to a limit,
denoted as (Z±, Y±), deﬁned in the same function space. Moreover, taking the limit n → ∞ in the
iterative system (3.4)–(3.5), we obtain the system of integral equations (2.11)–(2.12) for the limiting
functions (Z±, Y±). Therefore, the limiting functions (Z±, Y±) are solutions of the system (2.11)–
(2.12) in C 0,0,0(ΓT ). Since the sequence {Z±(n), Y±(n)}n∈N in C 0,0,0(ΓT ) satisﬁes the bounds (3.11)
that are independent of n, the limiting functions (Z±, Y±) satisfy the same bounds, which become
bounds (3.2). Finally, it follows from the contraction method that the local solution (Z±, Y±) is
unique in C 0,0,0(ΓT ).
(cid:3)

Lemma 2 Under conditions of Lemma 1, the unique local solution to the system of integral equa-
tions (2.11)–(2.12) belongs to the class (Z±, Y±) ∈ C 0,0,1(ΓT ) and satisﬁes

k∂xZ+k + k∂xZ−k ≤ 15Cϕ,

k∂xY+k + k∂xY−k ≤ 45Cϕ.

(3.24)

Proof. First, we prove existence of a unique solution (U±, V±) ∈ C 0,0,0(ΓT ) to the integral equations
(2.19)–(2.20) under the conditions of Lemma 1. Since solutions for (Z±, Y±) ∈ C 0,0,0(ΓT ) are
already obtained in Lemma 1, the coeﬃcients of the integral equation (2.19) and the arguments of
the unknown functions U∓ in (2.20) are all continuous functions in ΓT .

The ﬁrst equation (2.19) represents a linear relation between U± and V±. The second equation
(2.20) is linear with respect to (V+, V−) and quadratic with respect to (U+, U−). Therefore, ﬁrst
we solve (2.20) to obtain a unique map from (U+, U−) to (V+, V−), then we substitute the map to
(2.19) and solve the system uniquely in (U+, U−) by using the Schauder ﬁxed-point theorem.

Let us deﬁne a ball in C 0,0,0(ΓT ) of a ﬁnite radius given by

The integral equation (2.20) is rewritten in the explicit form

where we have used the constraint CϕT ≤ 1

smaller than the ﬁrst term in (3.26). Inverting the linear operator on V± in C 0,0,0(ΓT ) implies that
for every U± in the ball given by (3.25), there exists a unique solution V± ∈ C 0,0,0(ΓT ) of equation

This unique solution deﬁnes a map from (U+, U−) ∈ C 0,0,0(ΓT ) to (V+, V−) ∈ C 0,0,0(ΓT ). Since the
integral equation (3.26) is a quadratic polynomial on (U+, U−) ∈ C 0,0,0(ΓT ), the map C 0,0,0(ΓT ) ∋
(U+, U−) 7→ (V+, V−) ∈ C 0,0,0(ΓT ) is C ∞ in the ball (3.25).

Let us estimate the Lipschitz constant for the map C 0,0,0(ΓT ) ∋ (U+, U−) 7→ (V+, V−) ∈

Next, we substitute the map C 0,0,0(ΓT ) ∋ (U+, U−) 7→ (V+, V−) ∈ C 0,0,0(ΓT ) to the integral

integral equations (3.31) by using the Schauder ﬁxed-point theorem in the ball (3.25). By using
bounds (3.29) and the constraint ChT ≤ Cϕ, we estimate the integral terms in the left-hand-side

where we have used the constraint T Cϕ ≤ 1
15 . The integral terms in system (3.31) are strictly
smaller than the identity terms in the ball (3.25). Therefore, writing the ﬁxed-point problem in
the form

(cid:20) U+
U− (cid:21) =(cid:20) G+

G− (cid:21) + T (cid:20) U+
U− (cid:21)

(3.32)

shows that the nonlinear integral operator T maps the ball (3.25) to its smaller subset. The
inhomogeneous terms G± given by (3.31) are bounded by kG±k ≤ 2Cϕ. By the Schauder ﬁxed-
point theorem, there exists a solution (U+, U−) ∈ C 0,0,0(ΓT ) to the ﬁxed-point problem (3.32) in
the ball (3.25). The solution to the system of integral equations (3.31) satisﬁes the bound

and hence belongs to the ball (3.25). The solution is unique if the operator T is a contraction in the
ball (3.25) [12]. This is proved directly by using the Lipschitz continuity of the map C 0,0,0(ΓT ) ∋
(U+, U−) 7→ (V+, V−) ∈ C 0,0,0(ΓT ) with the Lipschitz constant given by (3.30). Indeed, we have

and a similar estimate for the second term in T . Therefore, the operator T is a contraction in the
ball (3.25) so that the solution (U+, U−) ∈ C 0,0,0(ΓT ) is unique.

For every (s, t, x0) ∈ ΓT , we repeat the estimates for the quotients

Z±(s; t, x) − Z±(s; t, x0)

x − x0

and

Y±(s; t, x) − Y±(s; t, x0)

x − x0

and prove that they remain bounded as x → x0 for every x0 ∈ R+. Furthermore, by repeating the
estimates for bounded functions

E±(s; t, x, x0) :=

Z±(s; t, x) − Z±(s; t, x0)

x − x0

− U±(s; t, x0)

and

F±(s; t, x, x0) :=

Y±(s; t, x) − Y±(s; t, x0)

x − x0

− V±(s; t, x0)

and using uniqueness of solutions of the integral equations (2.11)–(2.12) and their ﬁrst variations
(2.19)–(2.20), we obtain for every (s, t, x0) ∈ ΓT that

lim
x→x0

E±(s; t, x, x0) = 0 and

lim
x→x0

F±(s; t, x, x0) = 0.

Therefore, (Z±, Y±) are continuously diﬀerentiable with respect to x at every x0 ∈ R+ and the
correspondence (2.17) is established. Bounds (3.24) follow from bounds (3.25) and (3.29).

(cid:3)

Remark 4 Bounds (3.24) are bigger than the n-independent bounds (3.23). Nevertheless, the
bigger bounds (3.24) are still suﬃcient for invertibility of the characteristic coordinates ξ±(s; t, x)
with respect to x for every (s, t, x) ∈ ΓT . Indeed, bounds (3.24) imply that

where the constraint CϕT ≤ 1

are x-derivatives of the local solution (Z±, Y±) in Lemmas 1 and 2, then ξ±(s; t, x) > 0 for every
(s, t, x) ∈ ΓT .

Lemma 3 Under conditions of Lemma 1, the unique local solution to the system of integral equa-
tions (2.11)–(2.12) belongs to the class (Z±, Y±) ∈ C 1,1,1(ΓT ).

Proof. By Lemmas 1 and 2, there exists a unique solution (Z±, Y±) ∈ C 0,0,1(ΓT ) to the system of
integral equations (2.11)–(2.12). We show that the solution actually belongs to C 1,1,1(ΓT ).

Using similar estimates as in Step 2 in the proof of Lemma 1, we can use invertibility of the linear
integral operators and prove existence and uniqueness of solutions to the system (3.33)–(3.34) for
(∂tZ±, ∂tY±) in C 0,0,0(ΓT ). Moreover, the t-derivatives of (Z±, Y±) satisfy the following bounds:

4k∂xZ∓kT (3k∂tZ±k + k∂tY±k) .

By using bounds (3.1), (3.2), and (3.24), we conﬁrm that k∂tZ±k and k∂tY±k are bounded in
ΓT . Therefore, the solution (Z±, Y±) to the system of integral equations (2.11)–(2.12) belongs to
C 0,1,1(ΓT ).

19

Finally, we compute the derivatives of the system of integral equations (2.11)–(2.12) in s:

(3.36)

From (3.35), we conﬁrm that k∂sZ±k is bounded in ΓT . Then, from (3.36) and the bounds on
Z± ∈ C 1,1,1(ΓT ), we conﬁrm that k∂sY±k is also bounded in ΓT . Therefore, the solution (Z±, Y±)
to the system of integral equations (2.11)–(2.12) belongs to C 1,1,1(ΓT ).

(cid:3)

The proof of Theorem 1 follows from the results of Lemmas 1, 2, and 3, as well as the corre-
spondence result of Proposition 2. Solutions to the shallow-water system (1.1) are related to the
solutions to the system (1.3) by using the transformation (1.6).

4 Global solution to system (2.11)–(2.12)

It follows from the correspondence z±(t, x) = Z±(t; t, x) for (t, x) ∈ ΩT and the bounds (3.2) and
(3.24) that the local solution to the system (1.3) at time t = T satisﬁes the estimates

kz±(T,·)kC 1

b ≤ 15Cϕ.

(4.1)

If we attempt to continue this local solution beyond the time t = T by a recurrent use of Lemmas
1, 2, and 3, then we will run into the following obstacle.

Let us denote the solution to the system of integral equations (2.11)–(2.12) given by Lemmas 1,
± ) for m ∈ N, where T0 = 0. Then, iterating

± , Y (m)
2, and 3 extended from time Tm−1 to Tm by (Z (m)
bound (4.1) with the bounds (3.2) and (3.24), we obtain

Furthermore, using the constraint (3.1) on the continuation time, we have

kz(m)

b ≤ 15mCϕ, m ∈ N.

Tm − Tm−1 ≤

15m+1Cϕ

, m ∈ N.

(4.2)

(4.3)

Since the series Pm∈N 15−m converges, we have T∞ := limm→∞ Tm < ∞, so that the continuation

technique results in a local solution to the system (1.3) over a ﬁnite time span [0, T∞).

In order to be able to extend the local solution to the system of integral equations (2.11)–(2.12)
without restriction on time T , we shall ﬁnd a sharper bounds on the growth of the x-derivatives
of the solution (Z±, Y±). This is only possible under additional conditions (1.11) and (1.12) on the
function h and initial data, the latter conditions are rewritten in the form (1.14). The key result is
the following lemma.

20

Lemma 4 In addition to the conditions of Lemma 1, assume that conditions (1.11) and (1.14)
are satisﬁed. Then, the unique solution (Z±, Y±) ∈ C 0,0,1(ΓT ) to the system of integral equations
(2.11)–(2.12) constructed in Lemmas 1 and 2 satisfy the improved bounds

k∂xZ±k,k∂xY±k ≤ 2Cϕ.

(4.4)

Proof. The components (U±, V±) satisfy the system of integral equations (2.19)-(2.20) with the
correspondence (2.17). By Proposition 3 and Remark 4, we have 0 < ξ±(s; t, x) ≤ 1, U±(s; t, x) ≥ 0,
and V±(s; t, x) ≥ 0 for every (s, t, x) ∈ ΓT , where ξ± are related to U± and V± by (2.21). Therefore,
the integral equations (2.19)–(2.20) imply the bounds

kU±k ≤ Cϕ + ChT ≤ 2Cϕ,

kV±k ≤ kU∓k ≤ 2Cϕ,

where we have used ChT ≤ Cϕ as in Lemma 1. Due to the correspondence (2.17), we have obtained
the bounds (4.4)

(cid:3)

The sharper bounds (4.4) can be used to continue the local solution z±(t, x) = Z±(t; t, x) to the
system (1.3) globally in time. The next lemma establish piecewise continuation of solutions to the
system of integral equations (2.11)–(2.12) in C 1,1,1(ΓT ) for larger values of T .

(4.6)

(4.7)

Proof. The ﬁrst step of the induction method with bound (4.5) and the time constraint (4.7) is
justiﬁed by Lemmas 1, 2, 3, and 4.

By Proposition 1, the system of integral equations (2.11)–(2.12) remains closed in ΓTm−Tm−1,
so that z±(Tm, x) ≤ 0 and ∂xz±(Tm, x) ≥ 0 remain true for every x ∈ R+. Then, the system of
integral equations (2.11)–(2.12) remains closed in ΓTm+1−Tm as long as the solution exists. Let us
denote T := Tm+1 − Tm.

We review bounds used in the proof of Lemma 1. Since the superscript now refer to the (m + 1)-
th local solution deﬁned on the interval [Tm, Tm+1], we only look at the convergence of iterations
deﬁned by the system of implicit integral equations (3.4)–(3.5).
It follows from these integral

k∂xY (m+1)

±(n−1)k ≤ (3m + 4)Cϕ, n ∈ N,

(4.9)

which is true for n = 1. From the deﬁnition (3.13), bounds (4.5), (4.9), and ChT ≤ Cϕ, convergence
of successive approximations at the second level of Picard iterations in C 0,0,0(ΓTm+1−Tm) (Step 1)

has the norm being strictly smaller than one, under the constraint (4.7) on the time step T , we
establish existence and uniqueness of partial derivatives of (Z (m+1)
) in x for each n ∈ N.
Moreover, we can estimate them by obtaining bounds similar to (3.21) and (3.22). By using (4.11),

By the induction method, we obtain that bounds (4.9) are valid for every n ∈ N.

Convergence of the successive approximations {Z (m+1)

±(n) }n∈N at the ﬁrst level of Picard
iterations is proved in C 0,0,0(ΓT ) similarly to the proof of Lemma 1 (Step 3). Since the sequence
{Z (m+1)

Although the bounds (4.9) are independent of n, we still need to prove that (Z (m+1)

belong to C 0,0,1(ΓT ). We hence follow the proof of Lemma 2 and obtain (Z (m+1)
C 0,0,1(ΓT ) together with the bounds

Although the bounds (4.15) are bigger than bounds (4.9), which are independent of n, they are

The proof of Lemma 3 applies verbatim, so that we actually have (Z (m+1)

Finally, we improve the bounds (4.15) by using the technique in Lemma 4. In particular, we
(s; t, x) ≥ 0, and ξ±(s; t, x) ≤ 1 for every (s, t, x) ∈ ΓT . As

By Proposition 2, we obtain the classical solution to system (1.3) by z±(t, x) = Z±(t; t, x) for

solution (u, η) to the shallow water system (1.1). Thus, the proof of Theorem 2 is complete.
