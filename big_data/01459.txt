ABSTRACT. The lowest eigenmode of thin axisymmetric shells is investigated for two physical
models (acoustics and elasticity) as the shell thickness (2ε) tends to zero. Using a novel asymptotic
expansion we determine the behavior of the eigenvalue λ(ε) and the eigenvector angular frequency
k(ε) for shells with Dirichlet boundary conditions along the lateral boundary, and natural boundary
conditions on the other parts.

First, the scalar Laplace operator for acoustics is addressed, for which k(ε) is always zero. In
contrast to it, for the Lam´e system of linear elasticity several different types of shells are deﬁned,
characterized by their geometry, for which k(ε) tends to inﬁnity as ε tends to zero. For two families
of shells: cylinders and elliptical barrels we explicitly provide λ(ε) and k(ε) and demonstrate by
numerical examples the different behavior as ε tends to zero.

1. INTRODUCTION

The lowest natural frequency of shell-like structures is of major importance in engineering because
it is one of the driving considerations in designing thin structures (for example containers). It
is associated with linear isotropic elasticity, governed by the Lam´e system. The elastic lowest

eigenmode in axisymmetric homogeneous isotropic shells was address by W. Soedel [14] in the
Encyclopedia of Vibration:

[We observe] a phenomenon which is particular to many deep shells, namely that
the lowest natural frequency does not correspond to the simplest natural mode, as
is typically the case for rods, beams, and plates.

This citation emphasizes that for shells these lowest natural frequencies may hide some interesting
“strange” behavior. The expression “deep shell” contrasts with “shallow shells” for which the
main curvatures are of same order as the thickness. Typical examples of deep shells are cylindrical
shells, spherical caps, or barrels (curved cylinders).

In acoustics, driven by the scalar Laplace operator, it is well known that, when Dirichlet conditions
are applied on the whole boundary, the ﬁrst eigenmode is simple in both senses that it is not
multiple and that it is invariant by rotation. We will revisit this result, in order to extend it to mixed
Dirichlet-Neumann conditions. In contrast to the scalar Laplace operator, the simple behavior of
the ﬁrst eigenmode does not carry over to the vector elliptic system - linear elasticity. Relying on
asymptotic formulas exhibited in our previous work [5], we analyze two families of shells already
investigated in [2]. Doing that, we can compare numerical results provided by several different
models: The exact Lam´e model, surfacic models (Love and Naghdi), and our 1D scalar reduction.

The ﬁrst of these families are cylindrical shells. We show that the lowest eigenvalue1 decays
proportionally to the thickness 2ε and that the angular frequency k of its mode tends to inﬁnity
like ε−1/4.
The second family is a family of elliptic barrels which we call “Airy barrels”. Elliptic means that
the two main curvatures (meridian and azimuthal) of the midsurface S are non-zero and of the
same sign. Airy barrels are characterized by the following relations:

• The meridian curvature is smaller (in modulus) than the azimuthal curvature at any point
• The meridian curvature attains its minimum (in modulus) on the boundary of S.

of the midsurface S,

For general elliptic barrels, the ﬁrst eigenvalue tends to a positive limit a0 as the thickness tends
to 0. This quantity is proportional to the minimum of the squared meridian curvature. More
speciﬁcally, for Airy barrels, the azimuthal frequency k is asymptotically proportional to ε−3/7 as
ε → 0. Besides, for the particular family of Airy barrels that we study here, a very interesting
(and somewhat non-intuitive) phenomenon occurs: For moderately thick barrels k stay equal to 0
and there is a threshold for ε below which k has a jump and start growing to inﬁnity.

We start by presenting the angular Fourier transformation in a coordinate independent setting in
sect. 2 followed by the introduction of the domains and problems of interest in sect. 3. Sect. 4 is
devoted to cases when the angular frequency k of the ﬁrst mode is zero or converges to a ﬁnite

value as ε → 0. Cylindrical shells are investigated in sect. 5 and barrels in sect. 6. We conclude in
sect. 7.

2. AXISYMMETRIC PROBLEMS

Before particularizing every object with the help of cylindrical coordinates, we present axisym-
metric problems in an abstract setting that exhibits the intrinsic nature of these objects, in particular
the angular Fourier coefﬁcients. This intrinsic deﬁnition allows to prove that the Fourier coefﬁ-
cients of eigenvectors are eigenvectors if the operator under examination has certain commutation
properties.

2.1. An abstract setting. Let us consider an axisymmetric domain in R3. This means that Ω is
invariant by all rotations around a chosen axis A: For all θ ∈ T = R/2πZ, let Rθ be the rotation
of angle θ around A. So we assume

∀θ ∈ T, RθΩ = Ω.

Let t = (t1, t2, t3) be Cartesian coordinates in R3. The Laplace operator ∆ = ∂2
invariant by rotation. This means that for any function u

∀t ∈ R3, ∆(cid:0)u(Rθt)(cid:1) = (∆u)(Rθt).

∀θ ∈ T,

t1 + ∂2

t2 + ∂2

t3 is

The Lam´e system L of homogeneous isotropic elasticity acts on 3D displacements u = u(t) that
are functions with values in R3. The deﬁnition of rotation invariance involves non only rotation
of coordinates, but also rotations of displacement vectors. Let us introduce the transformation
Gθ : u (cid:55)→ v between the two displacement vectors u and v

Gθ(u) = v ⇐⇒ ∀t,

v(t) = R−θ

(cid:0)u(Rθt)(cid:1).

Then the Lam´e system L commutes with Gθ: For any displacement u

(2.1)
Now, in the scalar case, if we deﬁne the transformation Gθ by (Gθu)(t) = u(Rθt), we also have
the commutation relation for the Laplacian

L(Gθu) = Gθ(Lu).

∀θ ∈ T,

The set of transformations(cid:0)Gθ

(cid:1)

∀θ ∈ T, ∆(Gθu) = Gθ(∆u).
θ∈T has a group structure, isomorphic to that of the torus T:
Gθ ◦ Gθ(cid:48) = Gθ+θ(cid:48),

θ, θ(cid:48) ∈ T.

(2.2)

The rotation invariance relations (2.1) and (2.2) motivate the following angular Fourier transfor-
mation T (cid:51) θ (cid:55)→ k ∈ Z (here u is a scalar or vector function u or u)
t ∈ Ω,

(Gϕu)(t) e−ikϕ dϕ,

k ∈ Z.

(2.3)

(cid:98)u k(t) =

(cid:90)

Then each Fourier coefﬁcient(cid:98)u k enjoys the property:
(Gθ(cid:98)u k)(t) = eikθ(cid:98)u k(t),

T

t ∈ Ω,

θ ∈ T ,

and each pair of Fourier coefﬁcients(cid:98)u k and(cid:98)u k(cid:48) with k (cid:54)= k(cid:48) satisﬁes
which implies that(cid:98)u k and(cid:98)u k(cid:48) are orthogonal along each orbit contained in Ω and hence in L2(Ω).

(Rθt) dθ = 0,

t ∈ Ω,

The inverse Fourier transform is given by

(cid:90)
T(cid:98)u k(Rθt) ·(cid:98)u k(cid:48)
(cid:88)

u(t) =

(cid:98)u k(t),

t ∈ Ω.

The function u is said unimodal if there exists k0 ∈ Z such that for all k (cid:54)= k0, (cid:98)u k = 0, and
(cid:98)u k0 (cid:54)= 0. Such a function satisﬁes

k∈Z

(2.5)

(Gθu)(t) = eik0θ u(t),

t ∈ Ω,

θ ∈ T.

(cid:90)

For an operator A that commutes with the transformations Gθ, i.e., GθA = AGθ, as in (2.1) and
(2.2), there holds for any k ∈ Z

(AGϕu) e−ikϕ dϕ = A(cid:98)u k.
In particular, if Au = λu, then(cid:99)Auk = λ(cid:98)u k. We deduce from the latter equality that

(GϕAu) e−ikϕ dϕ =

(cid:99)Auk =

λ(cid:98)u k = A(cid:98)u k.

Therefore any nonzero Fourier coefﬁcient of an eigenvector is itself an eigenvector. We have
proved
Lemma 2.1. Let λ be an eigenvalue of an operator A that commutes with the group of transfor-
mations {Gθ}θ∈T. Then the associate eigenspace has a basis of unimodal vectors.
Remark 2.2. If moreover the operator A is self-adjoint with real coefﬁcients, the eigenspaces are

real. Since for any real function and k (cid:54)= 0, the Fourier coefﬁcient(cid:98)u−k is the conjugate of(cid:98)u k, the

previous lemma yields that if there is an eigenvector of angular eigenfrequency k, there is another
one of angular eigenfrequency −k associated with the same eigenvalue.

2.2. Cylindrical coordinates. Let us choose cylindrical coordinates (r, ϕ, τ ) ∈ R+ × T × R
associated with the axis A. This means that r is the distance to A, τ an abscissa along A, and ϕ a
rotation angle around A. We write the change of variables as

t = T (r, ϕ, τ ) with

t1 = r cos ϕ, t2 = r sin ϕ, t3 = τ .

The cylindrical coordinates of the rotated point Rθt are (r, ϕ + θ, τ ).

2.2.2. Vector case. Now, an option to ﬁnd a coordinate basis for the representation of displace-
ments is to consider the partial derivatives of the change of variables T
and Eτ = ∂τT .

Er = ∂rT , Eϕ = ∂ϕT ,

If we denote by Et1, Et2, and Et3 the orthonormal basis associated with Cartesian coordinates t,
we have

Er = Et1 cos ϕ + Et2 sin ϕ, Eϕ = −rEt1 sin ϕ + rEt2 cos ϕ,

and Eτ = Et3 .
We note the effect of the rotations Rθ on these vectors (we omit the axial coordinate τ)

Er(r, ϕ + θ) = (RθEr)(r, ϕ)

and Eϕ(r, ϕ + θ) = (RθEϕ)(r, ϕ)

(2.8)

and Eτ is constant and invariant.
The contravariant components of a displacement u in the Cartesian and cylindrical bases are de-
ﬁned such that

u = ut1Et1 + ut2Et2 + ut3Et3 = urEr + uϕEϕ + uτ Eτ .

Covariant components uj are the components of u in dual bases. Here we have
and ur = ur, uϕ = r2uϕ, uτ = uτ .

uti = uti, i = 1, 2, 3,

Using relations (2.8), we ﬁnd the representation of transformations Gθ

Gθu(t) = ur(r, ϕ + θ, τ ) Er(r, ϕ) + uϕ(r, ϕ + θ, τ ) Eϕ(r, ϕ) + uτ (r, ϕ + θ, τ ) Eτ ,

with t = T (r, ϕ, τ ). Then the classical Fourier coefﬁcient of a displacement u is:

uk(r, ϕ, τ ) = (ur)k(r, τ ) Er(r, ϕ) + (uϕ)k(r, τ ) Eϕ(r, ϕ) + (uτ )k(r, τ ) Eτ ,

uk(r, τ ) eikϕ =(cid:98)u k(cid:0)T (r, ϕ, τ )(cid:1),

where (ua)k is the Fourier coefﬁcient given by the classical formula (2.6) for u = ua with a =
r, ϕ, τ. We have a relation similar to (2.7), valid for displacements:

(2.9)
Let L be the Lam´e system. When written in cylindrical coordinates in the basis (Er, Eϕ, Eτ ), L
has its coefﬁcients independent of the angle ϕ. Replacing the derivative with respect to ϕ by ik
we obtain the parameter dependent system L(k) that determines the diagonalization of L

(r, τ ) ∈ ω, ϕ ∈ T,

k ∈ Z.

(Lu)k = L(k)uk,

k ∈ Z.

3. AXISYMMETRIC SHELLS

We are interested in 3D axisymmetric domains Ω = Ωε that are thin in one direction, indexed by
their thickness parameter ε. Such Ωε is deﬁned by its midsurface S: We assume that the surface
S is a smooth bounded connected manifold with boundary in R3 and that it is orientable, so that
there exists a smooth unit normal ﬁeld P (cid:55)→ N(P) on S. For ε > 0 small enough the following
map is one to one and smooth

Φ : S × (−ε, ε) →

Ωε

(P, x3)

(cid:55)→ t = P + x3 N(P).

(3.1)

The actual thickness h of Ω is 2ε (we keep this thickness h = 2ε in mind to bridging with some
results of the literature). Such bodies represent (thin) shells in elasticity, whereas they can be
called layer domains or thin domains in other contexts.

The boundary of Ωε has two parts:

(1) Its lateral boundary ∂0Ωε := Φ(cid:0)∂S × (−ε, ε)(cid:1),

(2) The rest of its boundary (natural boundary) ∂1Ωε := ∂Ωε \ ∂0Ωε.

The boundary conditions that will be imposed are Dirichlet on ∂0Ωε and Neumann on ∂1Ωε. We
consider the two following eigenvalue problems on Ωε, posed in variational form: Let

V∆(Ωε) := {u ∈ H 1(Ωε) ,

u = 0 on ∂0Ωε},

and

VL(Ωε) := {u = (ut1, ut2, ut3) ∈ H 1(Ωε)3 ,

u = 0 on ∂0Ωε}.

(i) For the Laplace operator: Find λ ∈ R and u ∈ V∆(Ωε), u (cid:54)= 0 such that
u u∗ dt.
(ii) For the Lam´e operator: Find λ ∈ R and u ∈ VL(Ωε), u (cid:54)= 0 such that

Both problems (3.2) and (3.3) have discrete spectra and their ﬁrst eigenvalues are positive. We de-
note by λ∆(ε) and λL(ε) the smallest eigenvalues of (3.2) and (3.3), respectively. By Lemma 2.1,
the associate eigenspaces have a basis of unimodal vectors. By Remark 2.2, in each eigenspace
some eigenvectors have a nonnegative angular frequency k. We denote by k∆(ε) and kL(ε) the
smallest nonnegative angular frequencies of eigenvectors associated with the the ﬁrst eigenvalues
λ∆(ε) and λL(ε), respectively.
In the next sections, we exhibit cases where the angular frequencies k(ε) converge to a ﬁnite limit
as ε → 0 (the quiet cases) and other cases where k(ε) tends to inﬁnity as ε → 0 (the sensitive or
excited cases).

We know (or reasonably expect) convergence of k(ε) for the Laplace operator and for plane shells.

4. QUIET CASES

4.1. Laplace operator. Let us start with an obvious case. Suppose that the shells are plane, i.e.
S is an open set in R2. Then Ωε is a plate The axisymmetry then implies that S is a disc or a ring.
Let (x1, x2) be the coordinates in S and x3 be the normal coordinate. In this system of coordinates
(4.1)

Ωε = S × (−ε, ε)
and the Laplace operator separates variables. One can write

∆Ωε = ∆S ⊗ I(−ε,ε) + IS ⊗ ∆(−ε,ε) .

(4.2)
Here ∆Ωε is the 3D Laplacian on Ωε with Dirichlet conditions on ∂0Ωε and Neumann conditions
on the rest of the boundary, ∆S is the 2D Laplacian with Dirichlet conditions on ∂S, and ∆(−ε,ε)
is the 1D Laplacian on (−ε, ε) with Neumann conditions in ±ε. Then the eigenvalues of ∆Ωε are
all the sums of an eigenvalue of ∆S and of an eigenvalue of ∆(−ε,ε). The ﬁrst eigenvalue λ∆(ε) of
(3.2) is the ﬁrst eigenvalue of −∆Ωε. Since the ﬁrst eigenvalue of −∆(−ε,ε) is 0, we have

λ∆(ε) = λS

and the corresponding eigenvector is u(x1, x2, x3) = v(x1, x2) where (λS, v) is the ﬁrst eigenpair
of −∆S. Thus k∆(ε) is independent of ε, and is the angular frequency of v.
In the case of a shell that is not a plate, the equality (4.2) is no more true. However, if ∆S denotes
now the Laplace-Beltrami on the surface S with Dirichlet boundary condition, an extension of the
result2 of [13] yields that the smallest eigenvalue of the right-hand side of (4.2) should converge
to the smallest eigenvalue of ∆Ωε. An extension of [13, Th. 4] gives, more precisely, that

λ∆(ε) = λS + a1ε + O(ε2),

(4.3)
for some coefﬁcient a1 independent on ε. Concerning the angular frequency k∆(ε), a direct argu-
ment allows to conclude.
Lemma 4.1. Let Ωε be an axisymmetric shell. The ﬁrst eigenvalue (3.2) of the Laplace operator
is simple and k∆(ε) = 0.

as ε → 0,

2In [13], the manifold S (denoted there by M) is without boundary. We are convinced that all proofs can be

extended to the Dirichlet lateral boundary conditions when S has a smooth boundary.

8

MARIE CHAUSSADE-BEAUDOUIN, MONIQUE DAUGE, ERWAN FAOU, AND ZOHAR YOSIBASH

Proof. The simplicity of the ﬁrst eigenvalue of the Laplace operator with Dirichlet boundary con-
ditions is a well-known result. Here we reproduce the main steps of the arguments (see e.g. [9,
sect. 7.2]) to check that this result extends to more general boundary conditions.

Let u be an eigenvector associated with the ﬁrst eigenvalue λ. A consequence of the Kato equality

∇|u| = sgn(u)∇u almost everywhere3

is that |u| satisﬁes the same boundary conditions as u and the same eigenequation −∆|u| = λ|u|
as u. Therefore |u| is an eigenvector with constant sign. The equation −∆|u| = λ|u| implies that
−∆|u| is nonnegative, and hence |u| satisﬁes the mean value property
|u(t)| dt

|u(t0)| ≥

(cid:90)

1

meas(B(t0, ρ))

B(t0,ρ)

for all t0 ∈ Ωε and all ρ > 0 such that the ball B(t0, ρ) is contained in Ωε. Hence |u| is positive
everywhere in Ωε. Therefore u = ±|u| and we deduce that the ﬁrst eigenvalue is simple.
By Lemma 2.1, this eigenvector is unimodal. Let k be its angular frequency. If k (cid:54)= 0, by Remark
2.2 there would exist an independent eigenvector of angular frequency −k for the same eigenvalue.
(cid:3)
Therefore k = 0.

4.2. Lam´e system on plates. The domain Ωε is the product (4.1) of S by (−ε, ε). For the smallest
eigenvalues λL(ε) of the Lam´e problem (3.3), we have the convergence result of [6, Th.8.1]

λL(ε) = λB ε2 + O(ε3),

as ε → 0,

(4.4)

Here, λB is the ﬁrst Dirichlet eigenvalue of the scalar bending operator B that, in the case of plates,
is simply a multiple of the bilaplacian (Kirchhoff model)

B =

E

on H 2

0 (S).

(4.5)

The reference [6, Th.8.2] proves convergence also for eigenvectors. In particular the normal com-
ponent u3 of a suitably normalized eigenvector converges to a Dirichlet eigenvector of B. This
implies that the angular frequency kL(ε) converges to the angular frequency kB of the ﬁrst eigen-
vector of the bending operator B.

4.3. Lam´e system on a spherical cap. A spherical cap Ωε can be easily deﬁned in spherical
coordinates (ρ, θ, ϕ) ∈ [0,∞) × [− π

2 ] × T (radius, meridian angle, azimuthal angle) as

Here R > 0 is the radius of the midsurface S and Θ ∈ (0, π) is a given meridian angle. Numerical
experiments conducted in [7, sect.6.4.2] exhibited convergence for the ﬁrst eigenpair as ε → 0
(when Θ = π

5. SENSITIVE CASES: DEVELOPABLE SHELLS

Developable shells have one main curvature equal to 0. Excluding plates that are considered
above, we see that we are left with cylinders and cones4.
The case of cylinders was addressed in the literature with different levels of precision. In cylin-
drical coordinates (r, ϕ, τ ) ∈ [0,∞) × T × R (radius, azimuthal angle, axial abscissa) a thin
cylindrical shell is deﬁned as

Here R > 0 is the radius of the midsurface S and L its length. The lateral boundary of Ωε is

One may ﬁnd in [15, 14] an example of analytic calculation for a simply supported cylinder using
a simpliﬁed shell model (called Donnel-Mushtari-Vlasov). We note that simply supported con-
ditions on the lateral boundary of a cylinder allow reﬂection across this lateral boundary, so that
separation of the three variables using trigonometric Ansatz functions is possible. This example
shows that for R = 1, L = 2 and h = 0.02 (i.e., ε = 0.01) the smallest eigenfrequency does not
correspond to a simple eigenmode, i.e., a mode for which k = 0, but to a mode with k = 4.

In ﬁgure 1 we plot numerical dispersion curves of the exact Lam´e model L for several values of
the thickness h = 2ε (0.1, 0.01, and 0.001). This means that we discretize the exact 2D Lam´e
model L(k) obtained after angular Fourier transformation, see (2.10), on the meridian domain

ωε =(cid:8)(r, τ ) ∈ R+ × R,

r ∈ (R − ε, R + ε),

τ ∈ (− L

2 , L

We compute by a ﬁnite element method for a collection of values of k ∈ {0, 1, . . . , kmax} so that
for each ε, we have reached the minimum in k for the ﬁrst eigenvalue.

So we see that the minimum is attained for k = 3, k = 6, and k = 11 when h = 0.1, 0.01, and
0.001, respectively. We have also performed direct 3D ﬁnite element computations for the same
values of the thickness and obtained coherent results. In ﬁgures 2-4 we represent the shell without
deformation and the radial component of the ﬁrst eigenvector for the three values of the thickness.
In fact the ﬁrst 3D eigenvalue λL(ε) and its associated angular frequency kL(ε) follow precise
power laws that can be determined. A ﬁrst step in that direction is the series of papers by Artioli,
Beir˜ao Da Veiga, Hakula and Lovadina [4, 1, 2]. In these papers the authors investigate the ﬁrst
eigenvalue of classical surface models posed on the midsurface S. Such models have the form

K(ε) = M + ε2B.

(5.1)
The simplest models are 3 × 3 systems. The operator M is the membrane operator and B the
bending operator. These models are obtained using the assumption that normals to the surface in
Ωε are transformed in normals to the deformed surfaces. In the mathematical literature the Koiter
model [10, 11] seems to be the most widely used, while in the mechanical engineering literature
so-called Love-type equations will be found [14]. These models differ from each other by lower

4Since we consider here shells with a smooth midsurface, cones should be trimmed so that they do not touch the

rotation axis.

[4, 1, 2] proved that α = 1 for the ﬁrst eigenvalue of K(ε) in clamped cylindrical shells. They
also investigated by numerical simulations the azimuthal frequency k(ε) of the ﬁrst eigenvector

[3] for some theoretical arguments based on special Ansatz functions in the axial direction).

In [5], we constructed analytic formulas that are able to provide an asymptotic expansion for k(ε)

We compare the asymptotics (5.3)-(5.4) with the computed values of kL(ε) by 2D and 3D FEM
discretizations, see ﬁgure 5. The values of kL(ε) are determined for each value of the thickness:

• In 2D, by the abscissa of the minimum of the dispersion curve (see ﬁgure 1)
• In 3D, by the number of angular oscillations of the ﬁrst mode (see ﬁgures 2-4)

Finally we compare the asymptotics (5.3)-(5.4) with the computed eigenvalues λL(ε) by four
different methods, see ﬁgure 6.

We can observe that these four methods yield very similar results and that the agreement with the
asymptotics is quite good. In [5, sect. 5] the case of trimmed cones is handled in a similar way
and yields goods results, too.

6. A SENSITIVE FAMILY OF ELLIPTIC SHELLS, THE AIRY BARRELS

In this section we consider a family of shells deﬁned by a parametrization with respect to the axial
coordinate, which is denoted by z when it plays the role of a parametric variable: The meridian
curve C of the surface S is deﬁned in the half-plane R+ × R by

C =(cid:8)(r, z) ∈ R+ × R,

z ∈ I, r = f (z)(cid:9)

where I is a chosen bounded interval and f is a smooth function on the closure of I. We assume
that f is positive on I. Then the midsurface is parametrized as (with values in Cartesian variables)

I × T −→
(z, ϕ)

S

(6.1)
Finally, the transformation F : (z, ϕ, x3) (cid:55)→ (t1, t2, t3) sends the product I × T × (−ε, ε) onto
the shell Ωε and is explicitly given by

(cid:55)−→ (t1, t2, t3) = (f (z) cos ϕ, f (z) sin ϕ, z).

With shells parametrized in such a way, we are in the elliptic case (that means a positive Gaussian
curvature) if and only if f(cid:48)(cid:48) is negative on I. In this same situation the references [4, 1, 2] proved
that the order (5.2) of the ﬁrst eigenvalue of K(ε) is α = 0. In [2], numerical simulations are
presented for the case

f (z) = 1 − z2

(6.3)
by solving the Naghdi and the Love models. A power law k(ε) ∼ ε−2/5 is suggested for the
angular frequency of the ﬁrst mode. The shells deﬁned by (6.2)-(6.3) have the shape of barrels,

Before presenting the analytical formulas of the asymptotics [5], let us show results of our 2D and
3D FEM computations. In ﬁgure 8 we plot numerical dispersion curves of the exact Lam´e model
L for several values of the thickness h = 2ε (0.01, 0.004, 0.002 and 0.001).

FIGURE 8. Shell (6.2)-(6.3): log10 of ﬁrst eigenvalue of L(k) depending on k for several
values of the thickness h = 2ε. Material constants as in [2]

We can see that, in contrast with the cylinders, k = 0 is a local minimum of all dispersion curves.
This minimum is global when h ≥ 0.005. A second local minimum shows up, which becomes the
global minimum when h ≤ 0.004 (k = 9, 12 and 16 for h = 0.004, 0.002, and 0.001, respectively.
In ﬁgure 9 we represent the radial component of the ﬁrst eigenvector for these four values of the
thickness obtained by direct 3D FEM.

FIGURE 9. Shell (6.2)-(6.3) and h = 0.01, 0.004, 0.002, 0.001: First eigenmode (radial component).

Comparing with the cylindrical case, we observe a new phenomenon: the eigenmodes also con-
centrate in the meridian direction, close to the ends of the barrel, displaying a boundary layer
structure as ε → 0. In [5] we have classiﬁed elliptic shells according to behavior of the function

If H0 is not constant, the classiﬁcation depends on the localization of the minimum of H0. If the
minimum is attained in a point z0 that is at one end of I, we are in what we called the Airy case.

We compare the asymptotics (6.5)-(6.8) with the computed values of kL(ε) by 2D and 3D FEM
discretizations, see ﬁgure 10. The values of kL(ε) are determined for each value of the thickness
by the same numerical methods as in the cylindric case.

The asymptotics is h (cid:55)→ 0.51738 · ε−3/7 (cid:39) 0.6963 · h−3/7 (with ν = 0.3).

Finally we compare the asymptotics (6.5)-(6.8) with the computed eigenvalues λL(ε) by the same
four different methods as in the cylinder case, see ﬁgure 11.
Here we present 2D computations with two different meshes. The uniform mesh has 2× 8 curved

interpolation degree is equal to 6. In the reﬁned mesh, we add 8 points in the meridian direction,
at distance O(ε), O(ε3/4), O(ε1/2), and O(ε1/4) from each lateral boundary, see ﬁgure 12. So the
mesh has the size 2 × 16. The geometrical degree is still 3 and the interpolation degree, 6. In this
way we are able to capture these eigenmodes that concentrate at the scale d/ε2/7, where d is the
distance to the lateral boundaries. In fact eigenmodes also contain terms at higher scales, namely
d/ε3/7 (membrane boundary layers), d/ε1/2 (Koiter boundary layers), and d/ε (3D plate boundary
layers).

FIGURE 12. Meshes for shell (6.2)-(6.3) and ε = 0.01: Uniform (left), reﬁned (right).

A further, more precise comparison of the ﬁve families of computations with the asymptotics is
shown in ﬁgure 13 where the ordinates represent now log10(λ − a0 − a1ε2/7). These numerical
results suggest that there is a further term in the asymptotics of the form a2ε4/7. We observe a
perfect match between the 1D Naghdi model and the 2D Lam´e model using reﬁned mesh. The
Love-type model seems to be closer to the asymptotics. A reason could be the very construction
of the asymptotics: They are built from a Koiter model from which we keep

7. CONCLUSION: THE LEADING ROLE OF THE MEMBRANE OPERATOR FOR THE LAM `E

SYSTEM

We presented two families of shells for which the ﬁrst eigenmode has progressively more oscil-
lations as the thickness tends to 0. The question is “Can we predict such a behavior for other
families of shells? What are the determining properties?”

In [5] we presented several more families of shells with same characteristics of the ﬁrst mode. The
common feature that controls such a behavior seems to be strongly associated to the membrane
If we superpose to our dispersion curves k (cid:55)→ λ(k)(ε) of the Lam´e system the
operator M.
dispersion curves k (cid:55)→ µ(k) of the membrane operator, we observe convergence to the membrane
eigenvalues as ε → 0 for each chosen value of k, see ﬁgure 14. We also observe that for each
chosen ε, the sequence λ(k)(ε) tends to ∞ as k → ∞. The appearance of a global minimum of
λ(k)(ε) for k that tends to ∞ as ε → 0 occurs if the sequence µ(k) has no global minimum: Its
inﬁmum is attained “at inﬁnity”.

FIGURE 14. Cylinders (left) and Airy barrels (right): First eigenvalues of L(k) depending
on k for several values of thickness compared with ﬁrst eigenvalues of M(k) (membrane).

For cylinders and cones, the sequence µ(k) tends to 0 as k → ∞. Hence the sensitivity. For elliptic
shells, the sequence µ(k) tends to a limit that coincides with the minimum of the function H0.
Sensitivity depends on whether µ(k) has a minimum lower than this value. From our previous study
it appears that any conﬁguration is possible. For hyperbolic shells, µ(k) tends to 0 so sensitivity
occurs, cf [4, 1, 2] but the analysis of the coefﬁcients in asymptotics cannot be performed by the
method of [5].

A natural question that comes to mind is: Are there other types of axisymmetric structures that
behave similarly? Rings (curved beams) are conceivable – The recent work [8] tends to prove that
sensitivity does not occur for thin rings with circular or square sections.
