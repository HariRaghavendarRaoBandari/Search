SOME NUMERICAL COMPUTATIONS ON REIDEMEISTER TORSION

FOR HOMOLOGY 3-SPHERES OBTAINED BY DEHN SURGERIES

ALONG THE FIGURE-EIGHT KNOT

TERUAKI KITANO

Abstract. We show some computations on representations of the fundamental
group in SL(2; C) and Reidemeister torsion for a homology 3-sphere obtained by
Dehn surgery along the ﬁgure-eight knot.

1. Introduction

In this note we show some numerical computations of representations of the fun-
damental group in SL(2; C) and Reidemeister torsion for the homology 3-sphere
obtained by 1/n-Dehn surgeries along the ﬁgure-eight knot. More precisely we
enumerate all conjugacy classes of irreducible representations in SL(2; C) and com-
pute Reidemeister torsion for these representations.

Reidemeister torsion was originally deﬁned by Reidemeister, Franz and de Rham
in the 1930’s. It is deﬁned in more general situation, but in this paper, we consider
this invariant for a homology 3-sphere M with an irreducible representation ρ of
the fundamental group into SL(2; C). It is denoted by τρ(M) ∈ C.
In the 1980’s Johnson [5] developed a theory of Reidemeister torsion for rep-
resentations in SU(2), or in SL(2; C). That was studied from the relations to the
Casson invariant. Further he proposed a torsion polynomial of a 3-manifold. In
this paper, we deﬁne the torsion polynomial as follows.

Let M be a homology 3-sphere. We denote the set of conjugacy classes of rep-
resentations from π1(M) in SL(2; C) by R(M) and the subset of conjugacy classes
with nontrivial value of Reidemeister torsion by R′(M).
Now assume that R(M) = R′(M) and it is a ﬁnite set.

Deﬁnition 1.1. A one variable polynomial

σM(t) = Y[ρ]∈R′(M)

is called the torsion polynomial of Mn.

(t − τρ(M))

In [9, 10] we gave explicit formulas of σM(t) in the case of Brieskorn homology

3-spheres obtained by surgeries along torus knots.

Remark 1.2. The torsion polynomial was deﬁned as
(t − 1/τρ(M))

± Y[ρ]∈R′(M)

under another normalization in [9, 10].

In this note, we show numerical computations for Dehn-surgeries along the

ﬁgure-eight knot by using Mathematica.

First we explain geometric setting, which is the same one in [7, 8]. Please see

2. Setting

them for details.

Let K ⊂ S 3 be the ﬁgure-eight knot and E(K) the exterior. It is well-known that

π1E(K) has the following presentation;

One can take x as a meridian element in π1E(K). As a longitude, one can do

where w = xy−1 x−1y.

whereew = x−1yxy−1.

π1E(K) = hx, y | wx = ywi

l = w−1ew

Let Mn be the homology 3-sphere obtaiend by 1/n-Dehn surgery along K. The

fundamental group π1Mn has the presentation as

π1Mn = hx, y | wx = yw, xln = 1i.

Let ρ : π1Mn → SL(2; C) be an irreducible representation. Simply we write X
for ρ(x), Y for ρ(y) and so on. We may assume that X and Y have the following
forms;

X = s

0 1/s! , Y =  s

Hence the parameter t can be eliminated by substituting

Under f (s, t) = 0, there are four choices on a pair of (X, Y) as follows.

By elementary arguments in linear algebras, on can see the following.

Lemma 2.1. Any pair of (X, Y) in the aboves, it gives the same conjugacy class of
irreducible representations of π1E(K) in SL(2; C).

Solve the inequality

1 − 2s2 − s4 − 2s6 + s8 > 0
under the condition s , 0 in the real numbers, one has
2(cid:16)3 + √5(cid:17), −r1
2(cid:16)3 −
√5(cid:17) ≤ s < 0,
√5(cid:17), r1
2(cid:16)3 + √5(cid:17) ≤ s
2(cid:16)3 −

s ≤ −r1
0 < s ≤ r1

and numerically

s ≤ −1.61803, −0.618034 ≤ s < 0, 0 < s ≤ 0.618034, 1.61803 ≤ s.

If s belongs to the above intervals, then the corresponding (s, t) gives an irreducible
representation of π1E(K) in SL(2; R).

Here the matrix corresponding to a longitude is given by

By direct computations, each entry Li j(i ≤ i, j ≤ 2) of L is given as follows:

We consider a 1/n-Dehn-surgery along the ﬁgure-eight knot. Note that X is

corresponding to a meridian. Then we compute the relation as

D = X − L−n = (Di j).

Remark 2.2. It holds that D21 = 0 identically, because X and L are upper triangular
matrices in SL(2; C).

Any solution of the systems of equations D11 = D12 = D22 = 0 gives a conju-
gacy class of SL(2; C)-representation. Because X and L are upper triangular matri-
ces, then it holds that D11 = 0 for some s ∈ C if and only if D22 = 0 for the same
s ∈ C. Hence we consider system of two equations D11 = D12 = 0.
Remark 2.3. For any solution s0 ∈ C \ {0}, then the complex conjugate of s0 is also
a solution. Because the complex conjugate ¯ρ of ρ is alway a represenation for any
ρ. If ρ given by s0 is an conjugate to a representation in SU(2), then ρ and ¯ρ are
conjugate each other. Because ¯s0 = 1/s0.

We consider Reidemeister torsion τρ(Mn) for Mn with ρ : π1(Mn) → SL(2; C).

For the precise deﬁnition of Reidemeister torsion τρ(M) for an SL(2; C)-representation
ρ, please see [6, 7, 11].

In the case of 1/n-surgeries along the ﬁgure-eight knot, we obtain the following

formula of Reidemeister torsion in terms of the trace of the meridian image.

Proposition 2.4 (Kitano[9]). If ρ is an acyclic representation, one has

τρ(M) =

where u = tr(X) = s + 1/s.

2(u − 1)
u2(u2 − 5) ∈ C \ {0}

Here ρ is called to be an acyclic representation if the chain complex of M with
ρ-coeﬃcients is an acyclic chain complex. By numerical computations we com-

C2
pute τρ(Mn) and σMn(t) by using this formula.

Here we mention the Casson invariant and the SL(; C)-Casson invariant. Please

see [1] and [4, 2, 3] for precise deﬁnitions and properties.

In 1980’s Casson deﬁned the Casson invariant λ(M) ∈ Z for a homology 3-
sphere M as the half of algebraic count of conjugacy classes of irreducible SU(2)-
representations. In 2000’s Curtis [4] deﬁned the SL(2; C)-Casson invariant λSL(2;C)(M) ∈
Z for M by counting conjugacy classes of irreducible SL(2; C)-representations. In
the case of 1/n-surgeries along the ﬁgure-eight knot, one has the following by ap-
plying general formula by Casson, and the one by Boden and Curtis.

Proposition 2.5.

• λ(Mn) = −n.
• λSL(2;C)(Mn) = 4n − 1.

Remark 2.6. The above proposition implies that the number of conjugacy classes
of SU(2)-represenations is algebraically 2|n| and the one of conjugacy classes of
SL(2; C)-represenations is 4|n| − 1.

3. Computation

Here we show computations from n = 1 to 10 by using Mathematica. We make

a list of the values of s, u = s + 1/s and τρ.

We remark the followings.

• We choice the value s in |s| ≤ 1. Because the inverse 1/s can be done if
• For a representation which is conjugate to the one in S U(2), we choice

|s| > 1.
only one value and omite its complex conjugate.

3.1. Summary. We compare computations with the values of Casson invariant
λ(M) and the SL(2; C)-Casson invariant λSL(2;C)(M). For any cases, we could ﬁnd
numerically 2|λ(M)| conjugacy classes in SU(2). However we could ﬁnd less con-
jugacy classes in SL(2; C) than |λSL(2;C)(M)| for n = 7, 9, 10.

Further for n = 7, 9, we could not do an SL(2; R)-representation.
We also compute torsion polynomials σMn(t). We simply write σn(t) to σMn(t).
From the deﬁnition, it is a polynomial over Q, because τρ(M) is an algebraic num-
ber for [ρ] ∈ R′(M). All previous examples in [9, 10] are polynomials over Z.
Hoever they are polynomial over Q, not the one over Z for n = 7, 8, 9.

3.2. The case of n = 1. The ﬁrst example M1 is the Briskorn homology 3-sphere
Σ(2, 3, 7), which is not a hyperbolic manifold. Now one has

• λ(M1) = −1,
• λSL(2;C)(M1) = 3 .

We ﬁnd 2 conjugacy classes of SU(2)-representations and totally 3 conjugacy classes
of SL(2; C)-representations. But the third one that does not come from SU(2)-
representations is an SL(2; R)-representation.

3.3. The case of n = 2. The next M2 is a hyperbolic homology 3-sphere. One has

• λ(M2) = −2,
• λSL(2;C)(M2) = 7 .

In this case we ﬁnd 4 conjugacy classes of SU(2)-representations and totally 7 con-
jugacy classes of SL(2; C)-representations. The last representation is an SL(2; R)-
representation.

The torsion polynomial is given by

σ6(t) = t23 − 504t22 + 52020t21 − 2.40364 × 106t20 + 5.93684 × 107t19

− 8.20377 × 108t18 + 6.23643 × 109t17 − 2.42844 × 1010t16 + 2.55758 × 1010t15
+ 1.64156 × 1011t14 − 6.99939 × 1011t13 + 8.04666 × 1011t12 + 1.36418 × 1012t11

+ 5.29833 × 1011t3 − 7.9675 × 1010t2 + 3.47288 × 109t − 8.38861 × 106.

3.8. The case of n = 7. In this example, the situation is changed. First one has
λ(M7) = −7, λSL(2;C)(M7) = 27.
In this case we ﬁnd 14 conjugacy classes of SU(2)-representations like previous
examples. However we do only 22 conjugacy classes of SL(2; C)-representations.
Further we do no SL(2; R)-representation.

3.9. The case of n = 8. In the next case, one has

• λ(M8) = −8,
• λSL(2;C)(M8) = 31.

In this case we ﬁnd 16 conjugacy classes of SU(2)-representations and totally
31 conjugacy classes of SL(2; C)-representations. The last representation is an

Here we ﬁnd 18 conjugacy classes of SU(2)-representations. But we do only 22

The torsion polynomial is given by

σ9(t) = t22 − 164.297 t21 + 9092.12 t20 − 205717. t19 + 2.48075 × 106t18 − 1.82943 × 107t17

+ 5.86714 × 106t4 − 724737. t3 + 37050.3 t2 − 579.611t + 1.92879.

It is clear that this is a polynomial over Q, not over Z.

3.11. The case of n = 10. One has

• λ(M10) = −10,
• λSL(2;C)(M9) = 39.

In this case we ﬁnd 20 conjugacy classes of SU(2)-representations. But we do
only 37 conjugacy classes of SL(2; C)-representations. The last one is an SL(2; R)-
representation.

In this case we see that the torsion polynomial is given by

σ10(t) = t37 − 1412.52t36 + 418175t35 − 5.66172 × 107t34 + 4.2454 × 109t33

− 8.61587 × 1019t16 − 1.47362 × 1020t15 + 2.57051 × 1020t14 − 1.15361 × 1020t13
− 9.11012 × 1019t12 + 1.35835 × 1020t11 − 4.44208 × 1019t10 − 2.62969 × 1019t9
+ 2.63319 × 1019t8 − 5.69579 × 1018t7 − 2.17961 × 1018t6 + 1.4686 × 1018t5

− 1.36745 × 1010.

This is also a polynomial over Q, not Z, because the coeﬃcient of t36 is not an
integer.

In [9, 10], the torsion polynomial for a Brieskorn homology 3-sphere obtained
by surgeries along a torus knot, which is not exactly same with the one given in
this paper, it can described by using Tchebychev polynomials of the ﬁrst kind. It
seems that it is natural, because any value of τρ is given by some special values of
the cosine function.

In the case of the ﬁgure-eight knots, or in more general cases of hyperbolic

knots, how to treat the torsion polynomial, it is a problem.
