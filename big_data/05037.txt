Abstract

Littlewood-Richardson (LR) coeﬃcients cλ

µν may be evaluated by means of sev-
eral combinatorial models, including the original LR tableaux of skew shape λ/µ
and weight ν and the LR hives with boundary edge labels λ, µ and ν. Unfortu-
nately, neither of these reveal in any obvious way the well-known symmetry property
cλ
µν = cλ
νµ. Here we introduce two maps, ρ(n) on LR tableaux and σ(n) on LR hives,
that each interchange contributions to cλ
νµ for any partitions λ, µ, ν of
lengths no greater than n, and then prove not only that each of them is a bijec-
tion, thereby making manifest the required symmetry property, but also that both
maps are involutions. The map ρ(n) involves the iterative action of deletion op-
erators on a given LR tableau of skew shape λ/µ and weight ν, that produce a
sequence of successively smaller tableaux whose consecutive inner shapes deﬁne a
certain Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern and determine a partner LR tableau of skew shape

λ/ν and weight µ. Similarly, the map σ(n) involves repeated path removals from
a given LR hive with boundary edge labels (λ, µ, ν) that give rise to a sequence of
hives whose left-hand boundary edge labels deﬁne the same Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern
as before, which is suﬃcient to determine a partner LR hive with boundary edge
labels (λ, ν, µ). The deletions in tableaux are organised so as to preserve the semis-
tandard and lattice permutation properties of LR tableaux, while the path removals
in hives are designed to preserve both the triangle condition on edge labels and the
hive rhombus gradient positivity conditions. At all stages illustrative examples are
provided.

Introduction and statement of results

Let n be a ﬁxed positive integer and let x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) be a sequence of indetermi-
nates. Then, for each partition λ of length ℓ(λ) ≤ n and weight |λ|, there exists a Schur
function sλ(x) which is a homogeneous symmetric polynomial in the xk of total degree |λ|.
These Schur functions sλ(x) for all such λ form a linear basis of the ring Λn of symmetric
polynomials in the components of x. It follows that

sµ(x) sν(x) =Xλ

cλ
µν sλ(x) ,

(1.1)

where the coeﬃcients cλ
µν are known as Littlewood–Richardson (LR) coeﬃcients. These
coeﬃcients are independent of n. They are non-negative integers that may be evaluated by
means of the Littlewood–Richardson rule [LR34] as the number of Littlewood–Richardson
tableaux of skew shape λ/µ and of weight ν, where λ and µ specify the outer and the inner
shape, respectively, of the tableau, and the parts of ν specify the numbers of its entries k
for k = 1, 2, . . . , n. Equivalently, cλ
µν is the number of Littlewood–Richardson n-hives with
boundary edge labels speciﬁed by the ordered triple (λ, µ, ν) [KT99, Buc00], where each of
the three partitions has n parts through the inclusion if necessary of trailing zeros. These
are the two combinatorial models to be considered in this paper; see Sections 2.1 and
2.2 for details. Although logically distinct, they may be thought of as being equivalent
thanks to the existence of a bijection between LR tableaux and LR hives described by
Fulton in the Appendix to [Buc00]. The bijective map f (n) from the set LR(n) of all LR
tableaux with no more than n rows to the set H(n) of all hives of side length n is explained
in Section 2.3. (See also [PV05].)

Within these two models, the set of LR tableaux of shape λ/µ and weight ν is denoted
by LR(λ/µ, ν), and the corresponding set of n-hives by H(n)(λ, µ, ν) for any ﬁxed n ≥ ℓ(λ).
We then have

cλ
µν = #{T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν)} = #{H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν)} .

(1.2)

Unfortunately, although the deﬁnition (1.1) makes it immediately clear that cλ
νµ,
the same cannot be said of either of the combinatorial formulae in (1.2). The aim here is
to provide bijective maps ρ(n) : LR(n) → LR(n) and σ(n) : H(n) → H(n), such that ρ(n) :
T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) 7→ S ∈ LR(λ/ν, µ) and σ(n) : H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) 7→ K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ),

µν = cλ

thereby proving the symmetry of the LR-coeﬃcients. It is further shown that these maps
are involutive.

Each LR n-hive is an equilateral, triangular graph of side length n, which may be
speciﬁed by means of vertex labels, edge labels or rhombus gradients, as described in
Section 2. It should be noted that in the edge labelling scheme an LR hive consists of
three interlocking, symmetrically oriented Gelfand–Tsetlin (GT) patterns [GT50], with
their types speciﬁed by the inner shape, weight and outer shape of the corresponding LR
tableau, as explained in Section 2.2. We would remark, in particular, that as a result
of the bijection between LR hives and LR tableaux, an LR tableau can be completely
speciﬁed by means of any one of the three GT patterns associated with an LR hive and
one additional sequence of boundary edge labels [BZ89, GZ86, KB96, HK06b, PV10].

The nature of our two maps ρ(n) on T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) and σ(n) on H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) is
that they proceed by providing sequences consisting of successively smaller LR tableaux
and of successively smaller LR hives in which the sequences of inner shapes and left-
hand boundary edges, respectively, determine the corresponding images S ∈ LR(λ/ν, µ)
and K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ). They do so by specifying completely a GT pattern of type µ
associated with K. Both maps have corresponding inverses ρ(n)−1 and σ(n)−1 acting in
a reverse manner. Their action on T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) and H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν), build up
sequences consisting of successively larger LR tableaux and of successively larger LR
hives, repectively, with their inner shapes and left-hand boundary edges determined by
the GT pattern of type ν associated with H, culminating, as will be shown, in the same
images as before, namely S ∈ LR(λ/ν, µ) and K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ). Thus the maps ρ(n) and
σ(n) are not only bijective, but also involutive.

1.1 Littlewood–Richardson commutativity involutions and the

gln-crystal commuter

Schur functions in n variables may be interpreted as irreducible characters of the gen-
eral linear group, GLn(C), and the Littlewood–Richardson coeﬃcient cλ
µν then has a
representation-theoretic signiﬁcance as the number of times the irreducible representation
Vλ appears in the decomposition of the tensor product Vµ ⊗ Vν of irreducible represen-
tations of GLn(C). Additionally, the Schur functions have an intersection-theoretic in-
terpretation as representatives of Schubert classes and, in the context of multiplication
in the cohomology of the Grassmannian, the Littlewood–Richardson coeﬃcient cλ
µν is the
multiplicity of the Schubert class σλ in the product σµσν of Schubert classes σµ and σν.
In both these contexts the products are manifestly commutative so that cλ

µν = cλ

νµ.

µν and cλ

So far as the equality of the numbers cλ

νµ is concerned just the existence of
any bijective map ρ between the sets they serve to enumerate may conclude the story. On
the other hand, there are situations where each element of the two sets represents some
distinguishable object, and then the action of the map ρ taking an element of one set to an
element of the other may carry a quite explicit piece of information that deserves further
investigation. The parametrisation of the connected components of the tensor product of
crystal bases Bµ ⊗ Bν is one such situation, particularly so in view of the fact that the

3

ﬂip map a ⊗ b 7→ b ⊗ a does not give an isomorphism of crystals Bµ ⊗ Bν → Bν ⊗ Bµ.

The gln-crystal version of the Littlewood–Richardson rule [Tho74, Tho78, Nak93,
Kwo09] amounts to the decomposition of the tensor product of crystals Bµ ⊗ Bν into
a disjoint union of crystals Bλ with multiplicities cλ
µν counted by the LR tableaux in
LR(λ/µ, ν). In [HK06b], Henriques and Kamnitzer realise their crystal commutor, which
had been deﬁned in [HK06a] in a more general setting, using the language of tableaux and
hives in the case of gln, where the key roles are played by the highest and the lowest weight
elements of the crystal Bλ, and the Sch¨utzenberger involution ξ which “reverses” the crys-
tal. These highest and lowest weight elements are characterised in part by two of the three
interlocking GT patterns associated with a hive, as will be made clear in Section 12.1.
The gln-crystal commutor Bµ ⊗Bν → Bν ⊗Bµ, linked in [HK06b] with the Sch¨utzenberger
involution, induces a bijection from the set of connected components isomorphic to Bλ
in Bµ ⊗ Bν to the analogous set in Bν ⊗ Bµ. Through the connection between such con-
nected components and hives, they obtain a bijective map H(n)(λ, µ, ν) → H(n)(λ, ν, µ),
inheriting its involutive nature from the crystal commutor. Thus they prove not only that
crystal tensor product multiplicities are symmetric, ensuring that cλ
νµ, but also that
this map is involutive. This map is also shown to coincide with another map constructed
using a special case of octahedron recurrence. In [DK05], instead of using Young tableaux,
Danilov and Koshevoy introduce other combinatorial objects, called arrays, and endow
them with a crystal structure to deﬁne a similar commutor.

µν = cλ

The Littlewood–Richardson commutativity bijections in [HK06b, PV10, DK05, DK08],
with exception of the bijection ρ3 described in [PV10] and originally deﬁned by the ﬁrst au-
thor in [Aze99, Aze00], have their involution property based on that of the above crystal
commutor [HK06a, DK05], which in turn is based on properties of the Sch¨utzenberger
involution.
In particular, the map ρ1 deﬁned by means of tableau switching opera-
tions [BSS96], is written as a composition of three Sch¨utzenberger involutions ([PV10],
Section 3.1), in order to conclude its involution property. In fact, Danilov and Koshevoy
show in [DK08] that their commutor, the Henriques–Kamnitzer hive and crystal com-
mutors [HK06b], and the maps ρ2 and its inverse ρ′
2 in [PV10], as well as the tableau
switching map ρ1 [BSS96], all coincide, and are therefore all involutions. The map ρ3,
was not considered by Danilov and Koshevoy. Our task here is to obtain an independent
proof of the involutive nature of ρ3, realised here through the bijective action of ρ(n) on
LR tableau and σ(n) on LR hives.

1.2 Our Littlewood–Richardson commutativity involution

In Sections 3–6, we discuss the map originally deﬁned by the ﬁrst author, which we denote
by ρ(n), taking any LR tableau T of shape λ/µ and weight ν to another such tableau S of
shape λ/ν and weight µ, where λ, µ and ν are partitions of length ≤ n, and prove that
the map ρ(n) has the involutive nature.

The map ρ(n) is introduced in Sections 3 and 4. Here we begin by outlining the
content of Section 4, only referring back to the content of Section 3 as and when necessary.
The map is deﬁned by way of transforming the tableau T = T (n) into gradually smaller

4

tableaux T (n−1), T (n−2), . . . , T (1) and ﬁnally into the empty tableau T (0), in such a way
that, upon each transition from T (r) to T (r−1), the outer shape simply loses its rth row,
the inner shape shrinks by losing a horizontal strip, the entries r are all removed but the
entries 1, 2, . . . , r − 1 are shifted in the tableau in a certain way without being lost; and
while doing so the tableau ρ(n)(T ) = S is constructed, gradually from bottom to top, in
such a way that the rth row of S is determined by the information on the change of the
inner shape from T (r) to T (r−1) along with the number of entries r removed from T (r)
(See Deﬁnition 4.1). The transformation from T (r) to T (r−1) is achieved by applying a
sequence of deletion operators (Deﬁnitions 3.1 and 3.6). The action of each such operator
is a gentle modiﬁcation of the inverse of Sagan–Stanley’s internal insertion. To be more
precise, the action starts from the rightmost corner of the bottommost row of the tableau,
and that corner is deleted in terms of the tableau’s shape. As for the entry of that corner,
it is simply removed if that entry matches the row number r, and in such a case that is the
only change made in the tableau by the operator. Otherwise a certain path is generated
starting from that corner, and the entries get shifted upwards along the path. The path
extends until reaching one of the corners of the inner shape, and an entry bumped out
of the path is placed in that corner. Moreover, this operation preserves the LR property.
Such an operation is repeated as many times as there are cells in the rth row of T (r) to
produce T (r−1). It easily follows from the deﬁnitions that the constructed tableau S has
shape λ/ν and weight µ, but in showing its LR property (Theorem 4.2), a key role is
played by the comparison results (Lemmas 3.8, 3.10 and 3.11) of the paths taken by the
deletion procedures when applied successively. An illustration of the complete procedure
of constructing S from T can be found in Example 4.4.

The map ρ(n)

is injective, since one can recover T (r) from T (r−1) along with the
inner and outer shapes of T (r), by applying internal insertions and augmenting by a
suitable number of entries r in row r. This gives the inequality of the cardinalities
|LR(λ/µ, ν)| ≤ |LR(λ/ν, µ)|. By applying the same argument with µ and ν switched, we
see that the inequality is actually an equality, and the injection is forced to be bijective
(see Theorem 4.8).

Then we prove that the map ρ(n) is an involution (Theorem 5.1). This proof is some-
what long and occupies both Sections 5 and 6. In Section 5 the proof is reduced to the
analysis, in the case where the tableau T has a single cell containing r in its bottom rth
row, of how the deletion from the bottom cell containing r “commutes” in a certain way
with the deletions starting from the cells in the (r − 1)th row, and how this commutation
relation is reﬂected in the constructed tableau S. This is spelt out in Proposition 5.8 and
the whole of Section 6 is devoted to its proof.

Let us add here that internal insertions, together with deletions, were originally used
in [Aze00] by the ﬁrst author in showing the bijectivity of ρ(n) and also in the statement
to which the proof of the involutive nature was reduced. This statement is equivalent to
Lemma 5.6, and Proposition 5.8 mentioned above is a reﬁnement of Lemma 5.6.

We turn now to our hive model and the problem of identifying a bijective map σ(n) :
H(n) → H(n) such that for all H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) we have σ(n)
: H 7→ K with K ∈
H(n)(λ, ν, µ). By virtue of the bijection f (n) from LR n-tableaux to LR n-hives introduced

5

in Section 2.3, deletions on tableaux correspond to path removals from a hive. These are
deﬁned in Section 7 in terms of the action of three types of path removal operators, χr,
φr and ωr. Each of these reduces or increases by 1 the values of certain edge labels in a
given hive. These edges form a connected path, starting from the base of the hive and
proceeding to its left or right hand boundary. The route taken by each path is determined
by the occurrences of upright rhombi of gradient 0. It is ﬁrst shown that this action on
an LR hive in H(r) always yields another LR hive in H(r).

The next step, described in Section 8, is to show that the systematic application of our
path removal operators to H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) reduces it to an n-hive involving an empty
rightmost diagonal which may be removed to give an (n−1)-hive. Iterating this procedure
reduces H to an an empty hive, and recording the succession of left-hand boundary edge
labels of the intervening hives enables us to build up a partner hive K. This procedure
which involves a succession of pairs, consisting at each stage of a hive and what we call a
truncated hive, is illustrated in Example 8.3. The main result in this section is the proof
of Theorem 8.4 in which it is stated, as required, that K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ). This allows us
to deﬁne our map σ(n) through the identiﬁcation of K with σ(n)H.

In the following Section 9 we introduce a hive path addition procedure that is used to
deﬁne a map σ(n) : H(n) → H(n) such that for any K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ) we have σ(n) : K 7→
H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν). By virtue of the bijection f (n) from LR n-tableaux to LR n-hives, it may
be noted that the insertion path operation on LR tableaux introduced in [Aze99, Aze00]
corresponds to our hive path addition procedure. The hive K determines the precise
sequence of path additions, and we successfully show in the proof of Theorem 9.3 that
the result is as claimed. This involves the use of three Lemmas concerning detailed
considerations of the relationship between successive path additions.

It is then not diﬃcult to show in Theorem 10.2 that the maps σ(n) amd σ(n) are
mutually inverse bijections on H(n). However, it is considerably more demanding to prove
that these maps are involutions. This is done in Section 10 where the approach makes
use of two hives H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) and ˆH ∈ H(n)(λ − ǫn, µ, ν − ǫk) where ˆH = ψn H
is obtained from H through the removal of single path reducing the uppermost non-
zero upright rhombus gradient, say Ukn, in the rightmost diagonal of H by 1. With this
notation a crucial step is the proof of Lemma 10.5 which states that σ(n)ψn H = φn σ(n)H.
This is conveniently illustrated in the commutative diagram of Lemma 10.5. Once again
the proof involves an iterative path removal procedure in which H and ˆH are ﬁrst reduced
in size from n-hives to (n−1)-hives. They diﬀer by edge label diﬀerences of ±1 along what
we call a line of diﬀerence, and the terminating level of this line on the left-hand boundary
deﬁnes a diﬀerence in the upright rhombus gradients of their partner truncated hives that
consist at this stage of a single diagonal. Continuing this process results in succession of
consecutive lines of diﬀerence in the hives generated from H and ˆH whose terminating
levels lead to diﬀerences of upright rhombus gradients in the consecutive diagonals, taken
from right to left, of their ﬁnal partner hives K and ˆK. This procedure is not, however,
without its problems. The removal paths in H and ˆH may intersect, bifurcate and rejoin,
and the heart of the proof is taken up with proving that these possibilities, associated
with what we call critical rhombi, are no impediment to proving Lemma 10.5. Armed

6

with this Lemma it is then straightforward to complete the proof of Theorem 10.8 stating
that σ(n) is an involution.

This completes the main part of our exercise, but in Section 11 it is pointed out that
all our hive path removal and addition procedures are driven and controlled by upright
rhombus gradients. This allows us to conclude that if K = σ(n)H and any other hive
H ′ shares the same set of upright rhombus gradients as H, then its partner K ′ = σ(n)H ′
shares the same set of upright rhombus gradients as K, regardless of the boundary edge
labels.
If follows that one can deﬁne what we call a U-system of triangular arrays of
non-negative upright rhombus gradients, on which σ(n) acts in a uniform way regardless
of the speciﬁcation of the boundary labels necessary to turn such an array into a hive. It
is shown in particular that for every set of non-negative upright rhombus gradients not
only does there always exists a corresponding dressing by means of boundary labels that
is an n-hive, but also that there is an inﬁnite set of such dressings.

Section 12 consists of the discussion of the question of coincidence of all Littlewood–
Richardson commutativity bijections, ρ1, ρ2, ρ′
2 and ρ3, as raised by Pak and Vallejo
in [PV10]. These include the Benkart et al. tableaux switching map [BSS96], referred to
as ρ1, and the Henriques-Kamnitzer crystal [HK06a] and hive [HK06b] commutor maps,
and those based on arrays due to Danilov and Koshevoy [DK05, DK08] that constitute
ρ2 and ρ′
2. The maps ρ(n) and σ(n) discussed here both correspond to the map introduced
by [Aze99, Aze00] in an attempt to provide a shortcut alternative to the tableau switching
map ρ1 of [BSS96] and referred to as the fundamental symmetry map ρ3 in [PV10]. This
section closes with an illustration in support of the coincidence of ρ1 and ρ3, an approach
to whose proof was proposed in [Aze08].

2 Notation and deﬁnitions

2.1 Partitions, Young diagrams and tableaux

A partition is a ﬁnite weakly decreasing sequence λ = (λ1, λ2, . . . , λl) of strictly positive
integers, each term of which is called a part. We use lower case Greek letters such as λ, µ,
ν, . . . to represent partitions, and for a partition λ we use λi to denote its ith part. The
number of parts of a partition λ is called its length and is denoted by ℓ(λ). The sum of
its parts is called its weight and is denoted by |λ|. Sometimes the sequence λ is identiﬁed
with a longer sequence obtained by adjoining an arbitrary number of trailing zeros. In
this situation the length ℓ(λ) still refers to the number of its strictly positive parts and we
set λi = 0 for all i > ℓ(λ). We regard an empty sequence, or a sequence whose terms are
all zero, as a special case of a partition, namely the zero partition of length 0 and weight
0.

The Young diagram D(λ) of a partition λ is deﬁned to be the subset { (i, j) ∈ N × N |
1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ(λ), 1 ≤ j ≤ λi } of N × N. We represent it as an aggregate of |λ| boxes or
cells arranged in ℓ(λ) rows left-adjusted to a vertical line with its row i (counted from
the top) consisting of λi cells for each i. We refer to the cell at the intersection of row i
and column j (counted from the left) as the cell (i, j). A corner of D(λ) is a cell (i, j)

7

of D(λ) such that its removal from D(λ) leaves the Young diagram of some partition of
weight |λ| − 1.

If λ and µ are any two partitions such that µi ≤ λi for all i then we write µ ⊆ λ. In
such a case ℓ(µ) ≤ ℓ(λ), |µ| ≤ |λ| and D(µ) ⊆ D(λ) and the pair (λ, µ) speciﬁes a skew
Young diagram D(λ/µ) of shape λ/µ. This is deﬁned to be D(λ) \ D(µ) = { (i, j) | 1 ≤
i ≤ ℓ(λ), µi < j ≤ λi }, so that λ and µ specify the outer and inner shape respectively,
and the number of cells in D(λ/µ) is |λ|−|µ|.

Example 2.1. In the case λ = (6, 5, 5, 1) and µ = (3, 3, 2) we have

D(λ) =

and

D(λ/µ) =

(2.1)

A tableau T shape λ (resp. λ/µ) is any map T:D(λ) → N (resp. D(λ/µ) → N). Such a
tableau T is represented by a Young diagram with each cell (i, j) containing the number
s as an entry if T (i, j) = s. In this context, we sometimes call an entry s ∈ N a letter.
If T is a tableau of shape λ/µ, and (i, j) ∈ D(µ), we may extend the deﬁnition of T by
saying that the cell (i, j) is empty in T (even though strictly speaking (i, j) is not a cell
of T ), or that it contains 0, and accordingly we may write T (i, j) = 0 in this case. The
weight of a tableau T is the sequence α = (α1, α2, . . . , αs, . . .) where αs is the number of
entries s occurring in T (i.e. αs = #T −1(s)), and, just as in the case of partitions, trailing
zeros may be omitted.
Deﬁnition 2.2. Let λ and µ be partitions such that µ ⊆ λ. A tableau T of shape λ/µ
is said to be semistandard if

1. T (i, j) ≤ T (i, j + 1) if (i, j) and (i, j + 1) both lie in D(λ/µ), that is to say the

entries in each row are weakly increasing from left to right, and

2. T (i, j) < T (i + 1, j) if (i, j) and (i + 1, j) both lie in D(λ/µ), that is to say the

entries in each column are strictly increasing from top to bottom,

and is said to satisfy the lattice permutation property if

3. the number of entries s occurring in the ﬁrst r rows of T does not exceed the number

of entries s − 1 occurring in the ﬁrst r − 1 rows of T , for all r ≥ 1 and s ≥ 2.

It follows from the lattice permutation condition that the weight ν of T must be a

partition of length ℓ(ν) ≤ ℓ(λ) such that ν ⊆ λ and |ν| = |λ| − |µ|.

Deﬁnition 2.3. A tableau T is said to be a Littlewood–Richardson (LR) tableau if it is
semistandard and if it satisﬁes the lattice permutation property. We denote the set of all
LR tableaux of shape λ/µ and weight ν by LR(λ/µ, ν). This set will be empty unless
µ ⊆ λ, in which case ℓ(µ) ≤ ℓ(λ). For each positive integer n we denote the union of
those sets LR(λ/µ, ν) for which ℓ(λ) ≤ n by LR(n). We refer to elements of this set as
LR n-tableaux.

8

Example 2.4. In the case λ = (9, 9, 6, 4, 1), µ = (7, 5, 3) and ν = (7, 5, 2) a typical
tableau T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) ⊂ LR(5) ⊂ LR(6) ⊂ · · · takes the form:

1 1
1 1 2 2

1 1 2

1 2 2 3

(2.2)

where the empty cells occupy the shape speciﬁed by µ, and the cells with entries occupy
the shape speciﬁed by λ/µ, and the numbers of these entries for each integer k give the
parts νk of ν.

2.2 Hives, edge labels, gradients and interlocking Gelfand–Tsetlin

patterns

It is convenient to introduce a second combinatorial construct, namely, that of a hive ﬁrst
introduced by Knutson and Tao [KT99] with properties described in more detail by Buch
[Buc00].

A hive expresses itself in three diﬀerent forms. In its vertex representation, as given in
[KT99] and [Buc00], a hive is a labelling of the vertices of a planar, equilateral triangular
graph, as shown below on the left of (2.3), satisfying the rhombus inequalities indicated
on the right of (2.3).
If the side length of the hive is n, then the hive is called an n-
hive, and the edges connecting all neighbouring vertices divide the entire triangle into n2
elementary triangles of side length 1. An elementary rhombus is the union of any two
elementary triangles sharing a common edge. The rhombus inequalities require that for
each such rhombus the sum of the labels of the vertices at the ends of the common edge
must be greater than or equal to the sum of the labels of the other two vertices of the
rhombus. The hive is said to be an integer hive if all its vertex labels are integers.

For example in the case n = 4 we have:

The display on the left shows our indexing convention of the vertex labels, and the diagram
on the right indicates the nature of the rhombus inequality, to be applied to all elementary
rhombi of the three diﬀerent dispositions via rotation.

It is convenient to anchor each hive by setting a00 = 0, as we shall see below.

Its second form, the edge representation as introduced by [KTT06] and used in [KTT09,
CJM11], is one in which a hive is a labelling of all edges of its graph that satisﬁes the
triangle conditions and the betweenness conditions speciﬁed below in (2.6) and (2.8),
respectively.

A naming convention for the edge labels has been chosen so that αij, βij and γij label
the edges parallel to the left, right and lower boundaries, respectively, of the hive, with the
vertex labelled aij in (2.3) at their rightmost end. As a matter of convention we sometimes
refer to any edge parallel to the left, right or lower boundary as being an α-edge, β-edge
or γ-edge, respectively. The triangle conditions require that the edge labels α, β and γ
satisfy

in each elementary triangle of the hive of the two types

α + β = γ

α

β

γ

γ

and

β

α

(2.6)

(2.7)

In addition, the betweenness conditions require that

αi−1,j−1 ≥ αij ≥ αi−1,j;

βij ≥ βi,j−1 ≥ βi+1,j;

γi,j−1 ≥ γij ≥ γi+1,j

(2.8)

hold for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, where as an aide-m´emoire the arrangements of these edge labels
are illustrated by

αi−1,j

αi−1,j−1

αij

βi,j−1

βij

βi+1,j

γij

γi,j−1 γi+1,j

(2.9)

With this convention, the transformation from the vertex labelling to the edge labelling
is done by setting each edge label equal to the label of the edge’s right hand vertex minus
that of its left hand vertex, that is by setting:

αij = aij − ai,j−1 ;

βij = aij − ai−1,j ;

γij = aij − ai−1,j−1 .

(2.10)

This ensures that the edge labels of (2.7) automatically satisfy (2.6). In the other direction,
(2.6) ensures that inductively ﬁnding the vertex labels from the edge labels starting with
a00 = 0 gives a consistent result.
Example 2.6. Applying (2.10) to the hive speciﬁed in Example 2.5 by means of its vertex
representation (2.4) yields the edge representation:

(2.11)

Under this correspondence between vertex and edge representations of a hive, the
rhombus inequalities of (2.3) are translated into the betweenness conditions (2.8) as fol-
lows. Within a hive there are three types of elementary rhombi: right-leaning, upright
and left-leaning, as illustrated by

(2.12)

The parameters Rij, Uij and Lij introduced in these diagrams are not edge labels. They
are referred to as the gradients of the corresponding right-leaning, upright and left-leaning
rhombi, respectively. Each gradient is deﬁned to be the diﬀerence between parallel edge
labels in the relevant rhombus or, equivalently, the four-term alternating sign sum of the
vertex labels of that rhombus. To be precise, in terms of the edge labels the gradients are
given by:

Rij = αi−1,j−1 − αij = γi,j−1 − γij ;
Uij = αij − αi−1,j = βij − βi,j−1 ;
Lij = βi,j−1 − βi+1,j = γij − γi+1,j .

(2.13)

From the edge representation, the equalities on the right are a consequence of the triangle
conditions. The rhombus inequalities of (2.3) then take the form:

Rij ≥ 0, Uij ≥ 0, Lij ≥ 0 for all i, j such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n.

(2.14)

They are equivalent to the requirement that in each of the above diagrams (2.12) the label
on a thick edge is greater than or equal to the label on its parallel thin edge. Combining
the rhombi of (2.12) in pairs produces the trapezia of (2.9) and leads immediately to the
betweenness conditions (2.8).

All this gives rise to a third way of specifying hives, namely the gradient representation,
which involves labelling its boundary edges and giving the gradients of one or other of its
three sets of right-leaning, upright or left-leaning elementary rhombi. This is illustrated
in the case n = 5 by

In each of these three labelling schemes there are constraints on one set of boundary edge
labels, namely the β, γ and α labels in the case of right-leaning, upright and left-leaning
rhombi. For example, in the case of the upright rhombi which we mostly use in this paper,

Deﬁnition 2.7. An integer hive with a00 = 0 is said to be a Littlewood–Richardson
(LR) hive if all of its edge labels are non-negative integers. By virtue of the betweenness
conditions (2.8) this is equivalent to the requirement that its boundary edges are labelled
by the parts of partitions. For a ﬁxed positive integer n let H(n) denote the set of all
LR n-hives and let H(n)(λ, µ, ν) be the set of LR n-hives whose lower, left and right
boundary edge labels are speciﬁed by the parts of the partitions λ, µ and ν of lengths
ℓ(λ), ℓ(µ), ℓ(ν) ≤ n, arranged as exempliﬁed in the case n = 5 by

(2.18)

where the edge labels on the left, right and lower boundary are enumerated from bottom
to top, from top to bottom and from left to right, respectively.

Since all edge labels are ≥ 0 it also follows that in every elementary triangle labelled as
in (2.6) we have both γ ≥ α and γ ≥ β. Moreover, repeated use of the triangle condition
(2.6) ensures that

|λ| = |µ| + |ν| .

(2.19)

It should be noted that the betweenness conditions (2.8) imply that within an LR
hive H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) the non-negative integer α, β and γ edge labels automatically
specify three diﬀerently oriented interlocking Gelfand–Tsetlin (GT) patterns [GT50] of
types speciﬁed by the boundary edge labels µ, ν and λ, respectively.

For the relevant deﬁnitions of GT patterns, their type and weight and their one–to–
one correspondence with semistandard Young tableaux, see, for example, [Lou08]. Suﬃce
to say at this point, that a GT pattern, G, is a triangular array of non-negative integers
(λ(i)

j )1≤j≤i≤n that may be abbreviated to (λ) and displayed as below:

λ(n)

The entries satisfy the betweenness conditions λ(i+1)
for 1 ≤ j ≤ i < n.
The ith row, enumerated from bottom to top, necessarily constitutes a partition λ(i) of
length ≤ i. Such a GT pattern is said to be of type λ(n) and of weight γ = (γ1, γ2, . . . , γn)
where γi = |λ(i)| − |λ(i−1)| for i = 1, 2, . . . , n, with |λ(0)| = 0. The GT patterns of type

j ≥ λ(i+1)

j+1

≥ λ(i)

13

j − λ(i−1)

λ(n) are in bijective correspondence with semistandard Young tableaux of shape λ(n). The
partitions λ(i) specify the shape of that part of the semistandard tableaux consisting of
entries ≤ i, that is to say having λ(i)
Example 2.8. Our previous Examples 2.5 and 2.6 illustrate an LR hive H ∈ H(5)(λ, µ, ν)
with λ = (9, 9, 6, 4, 1), µ = (7, 5, 3, 0, 0) and ν = (7, 5, 2, 0, 0) in its vertex and edge
representations, (2.4) and (2.11), respectively. From the latter, one can see that the three
diﬀerently oriented interlocking Gelfand–Tsetlin patterns are of types µ, ν and λ and
weights rev(λ − ν), λ − µ and ν + rev(µ), respectively, where rev(κ) = (κn, . . . , κ2, κ1)
for any κ = (κ1, κ2, . . . , κn). They are displayed below along with their corresponding
semistandard tableaux.

(2.21)
The superscripts (α), (β) and (γ) are intended to indicate that the three GT patterns
specify the α, β and γ-edge labels of a hive, in this case the hive H of (2.11), and that the
three semistandard tableaux correspond to these same GT patterns. In the case of each
GT pattern the speciﬁcation of the original hive H may be completed by adding either
set of missing boundary edge labels, and then evaluating all the remaining edge labels by
means of the hive elementary triangle condition (2.6).

Alternatively, to avoid the necessity of giving any internal edge labels we may complete
the speciﬁcation of a typical LR hive by giving in addition to its non-negative boundary
edge labels, λi, µi and νi for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, one set of rhombus non-negative integer gradients,
namely Uij for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, as illustrated by

It is convenient to refer to the portion of such a hive consisting of a sequence of upright
rhombi with gradients Uij for ﬁxed j and i = 1, 2, . . . , j −1, together with a corresponding
elementary triangle with bottom edge labelled λj, as the jth diagonal of the hive.

With the above labelling the application of the condition γ ≥ α to the elementary

triangle at the foot of the hive with edge label λk ensures that

λk ≥ µk +

applied to the elementary triangle with edge label βk, one ﬁnds in the case of our LR hive
that

2.3 Connection between hives and tableaux

Let n be a ﬁxed positive integer. Then there is a one-to-one correspondence between
LR n-tableaux and LR n-hives. Let f (n) denote the map from LR(n) to H(n). taking
T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) to H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) by setting the upright rhombus gradients of H to

Uij = #entries i in row j of T for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n ,

(2.25)

and adding the boundary edge labels λ, µ and ν.
Example 2.9. In the case λ = (9, 9, 6, 4, 1), µ = (7, 5, 3), ν = (7, 5, 2), n = 5 and T as
shown on the left, the corresponding hive H is displayed on the right:

(2.26)

Before discussing the hive conditions, let us mention that it is also easy to describe
the inverse map f (n)−1. The boundary edge labels λi and µi for i = 1, 2, . . . , n specify
the skew shape λ/µ. Each rhombus gradient Uij for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n speciﬁes the number
of entries i in row j of T . For i from 1 to j − 1 these are arranged in weakly increasing
i=1 Uij
cells of this jth row are then ﬁlled with entries j. The number of these cells is necessarily

order from left to right across the jth row of T and the remaining λj − µj −Pj−1

15

non-negative since it is nothing other than the edge label βjj, and within any LR hive
all edge labels are ≥ 0. This also ensures that the total number of entries j in T is
j=i+1 Uij, but from the deﬁnition of the gradients this is just βjn = νj so that T

βjj +Pn

has weight ν = (ν1, ν2, . . . , νn).

Now we show that the map f (n) from tableaux to hives and its inverse f (n)−1 preserve
the Littlewood–Richardson nature of both tableaux and hives. To see this it should be
noted that

Uij = # of entries i in row j of T ;

Uk,j−1) − (µj +

Uk,j)

= # of entries i in the topmost j − 1 rows of T

−# of entries i + 1 in the topmost j rows of T ,

(2.29)

for all (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. It will be recognised that the conditions Uij ≥ 0
correspond to the ﬁlling of the rows of T with non-negative numbers of integer entries,
while the conditions Rij ≥ 0 correspond to the fact that entries of T are strictly increasing
down columns, while the conditions Lij ≥ 0 correspond to the lattice permutation rule of
Deﬁnition 2.2 for 2 ≤ s ≤ r ≤ n, with all other cases trivial.

This suﬃces to show that the above map f (n) that takes T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) to H ∈
H(n)(λ, µ, ν), for any ﬁxed n ≥ ℓ(λ), is a bijection. Since this is true for all λ, µ, ν with
ℓ(λ) ≤ n, f (n) provides a bijection from LR(n) to H(n).

In order to interpret hive edge labels and the constituent Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns in
terms of tableau parameters, it might be noted that under this bijection, the partition
(λ1, λ2, . . . , λi, αi,i+1, αi,i+2, . . . , αin) speciﬁes the shape of the subtableau of T consisting
of all entries ≤ i including 0 or empty boxes, for i ≥ 0, with this partition coinciding
with µ in the special case i = 0. On the other hand the partitions (β1j, β2j, . . . , βjj) for
j = 1, 2, . . . , n specify the weights of the ﬁrst j rows of T , with this partition coinciding
with ν in the special case j = n. More explicitly, αij is the number of entries ≤ i in row
j, βij is the total number of entries i in rows 1, 2, . . . , j and γij = αi−1,j + βij. It follows
that:

• G(α)
µ

is obtained from T ∈ LR(n) by recording the sequence of partitions giving the

shapes occupied by the entries < r in rows r, r + 1, . . . , n of T , for r = 1, 2, . . . , n.

• G(β)
ν

is obtained from T ∈ LR(n) by recording the sequence of partitions giving the

weights of the subtableau consisting of the ﬁrst r rows of T for r = n, . . . , 2, 1.

2.4 Combinatorial models for LR coeﬃcients

The Littlewood–Richardson rule states that the coeﬃcients appearing in the expansion
(1.1) of a product of Schur functions are given by

cλ
µν = #{T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν)}.

(2.30)

It follows from the bijection between Littlewood–Richardson n-tableaux and Littlewood–
Richardson n-hives for any ﬁxed n ≥ ℓ(λ) that

cλ
µν = #{H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν)}.

(2.31)

This result is due to Fulton, as reported in the Appendix to [Buc00].

Alternative combinatorial models for the LR coeﬃcients have been provided, based
not on the full speciﬁcation of hives, but rather on one or two of their three interlocking
Gelfand–Tsetlin patterns as exempliﬁed in (2.21). Let GT κ
ν denote the set of GT patterns
of type ν and weight κ. Then, for example, Theorem 1 of [GZ86] may be expressed in the
form

cλ
µν = #{G ∈ GT λ−µ

ν

| d(i)

j (ν) ≤ µi − µi+1 for 1 ≤ j ≤ i < n} ,

(2.32)

where G = (ν) = (ν(i)
j )1≤i≤j≤n. If G is reoriented so that its entries label the β-edges of a
potential hive, H, then by virtue of the GT pattern betweenness conditions it automati-
cally satisﬁes the two sets of rhombus conditions, Lij ≥ 0 and Uij ≥ 0 for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n.
Moreover, it may then be seen that d(i)
k=1 Uki for 1 ≤ j ≤ i < n.
These constraints are precisely those appearing on the left of (2.17) with αi = µi for
i = 1, 2, . . . , n, which correspond to the conditions Rj,i+1 ≥ 0. It follows that G restricted
by these conditions is precisely a GT pattern of the form G(β)
ν , whose completion by means
of the speciﬁcation of the remaining boundary edges and the use of the hive elementary
triangle condition (2.6) gives some H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν).

k=1 Uk,i+1 −Pj−1

j (ν) =Pj

Similarly, Theorem 4.3 of [BZ89] may be expressed in the form

µν = #{G ∈ GT rev(λ−ν)

µ

| n(j)

i (µ) ≤ νi − νi+1 for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n}

(2.33)

It may then be seen that n(j)

where G = (µ) = (µ(i)
j )1≤i≤j≤n. This time if G is reoriented so that its entries label
the α-edges of a potential hive, then by virtue of the GT pattern betweenness conditions
it automatically satisﬁes the two sets of rhombus conditions, Rij ≥ 0 and Uij ≥ 0 for
k=j+1 Ui+1,k for
1 ≤ i < j ≤ n.
1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. These constraints are precisely those appearing on the right of (2.17) with
βi = νi for i = 1, 2, . . . , n, which correspond to the conditions Lij ≥ 0. It follows that G
restricted by these conditions is precisely a GT pattern of the form G(α)
µ , whose completion
as before gives some H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν). Alternatively, a complete speciﬁcation of the
hive may be accomplished by using the GT pattern G(α)
augmented this time through
µ
the addition of the boundary edge labels λi, as is done in [Lou08], for example, where
in equation (11.135) the LR coeﬃcients are expressed as the number of such modiﬁed
GT patterns satisfying lattice permutation conditions derived from the corresponding

k=j Uik −Pn

i (µ) = Pn

17

LR tableau. The conditions involve parameters lij, where li,j = Uji for j < i, and
j=1 Uji, and the conditions themselves once more correspond to the

li,i = λi − µi −Pi−1

non-negativity of Lij for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n.

Finally, from a consideration of the highest and lowest weight elements of the connected

components isomorphic to Bλ in Bµ ⊗ Bν [HK06b] it may be seen that

µν = #{(G1, G2) ∈ GT rev(λ−ν)

where G1 = (µ(i)
j )1≤i≤j≤n. In this case G1 and G2 may be reori-
ented so as to form two interlocking GT patterns in the shape of a hive H with their
entries labelling the α and β edges, respectively. Then the result, obtained through the
application of the hive triangle conditions to specify the remaining γ-edge labels, is a hive
with all rhombus gradients non-negative if and only if the gradients Uij of the upright
rhombi arising from G1 and G2 coincide. In such a case the upright rhombus gradients
are given by Uij = µ(n−i)
, thereby explaining the necessity of
these conditions appearing in (2.34). So the pair (G1, G2) is to be identiﬁed with the pair
of GT patterns (G(α)

ν ) associated with some H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν).

µ , G(β)

j−i+1 = ν(j)

Thus all three of the above combinatorial expressions (2.32)-(2.34) for cλ

µν coincide
with that given in (2.31). In what follows, rather than explicitly using GT patterns, we
use the hive model based on (2.31). In doing so it is worth commenting here on the case
ℓ(λ) = r with r < n for which we have λn = 0. The hive conditions then imply that
µn = νn = 0 and the upright rhombus gradients Uin in the nth diagonal of any n-hive
H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) with λn = 0 are all 0. We say in such a case that the nth diagonal of
H is empty. Let κn be an operator whose action is to restrict any n-hive H with empty
nth diagonal to an (n − 1)-hive ˜H consisting of the leftmost (n − 1) diagonals of H. This
map from H(n)(λ, µ, ν) with λn = 0 to H(n−1)(λ, µ, ν) generated by the application of
κn is necessarily a bijection since both H(n)(λ, µ, ν) and H(n−1)(λ, µ, ν) are in bijective
correspondence with LR(λ/µ, ν), with the two maps from T to H and from T to ˜H,
governed by (2.25) for appropriate values n and n − 1, respectively, ensuring consistency
with the map κn : H 7→ ˜H.

The operations κk for k = 1, 2, . . . , n are required in Sections 8 and 10 where we con-
struct a bijective map from H(n)(λ, µ, ν) to H(n)(λ, ν, µ) and prove its involutive property
when extended to map from H(n) to H(n).

3 The action of deletion operators on tableaux

Our task is to provide a bijective map from all T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) to all S ∈ LR(λ/ν, µ),
and to show that this bijection is an involution, or, equivalently, to provide a map from
all H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) to all K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ), and to show it has the same properties. As
a ﬁrst step it is useful to deﬁne certain deletion operators whose action on T or H will
enable us to build up S or K.

First we deal with tableaux, for which the deletion operators were ﬁrst introduced
in [Aze99, Aze00], and later described in [PV10]. Their action can be speciﬁed by modi-
fying slightly a deletion procedure described by Sagan and Stanley [SS90].
Deﬁnition 3.1. For any given T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν), augmented by the inclusion of entries
0 in each cell of D(µ), and any corner cell (r, λr) of D(λ) the deletion operator δr,λr is
deﬁned to be such that:
(i) if T (r, λr) = r then the action of δr,λr on T is just to delete the cell (r, λr). In this case
a parameter called the terminating row number is deﬁned to be 0.
(ii) if 0 < T (r, λr) < r then the action of δr,λr on T is ﬁrst to delete the cell (r, λr) and
move its entry into row r −1 by replacing the rightmost entry strictly less than itself, with
that replaced entry in turn being bumped into row r − 2, again replacing the rightmost
entry strictly less than itself, and continuing in this way until an entry 0 is replaced by
some non-zero entry x, say. Note that this ﬁnal replacement occurs at some corner cell
(k, µk) of D(µ) since, if the original position of the entry x is (k + 1, j), the cell (k, j)
must have been empty (otherwise there would have been an entry T (k, j) < x in row k)
so that we have µk ≥ j > µk+1. In this case the terminating row number is deﬁned to be
k. The set of the cells where the changes are made deﬁnes a deletion path P in the form
of a vertical strip from the corner (r, λr) of D(λ) to a corner (k, µk) of D(µ) with one cell
P [s] in row s for each s = r, r − 1, . . . , k. The reason why the path forms a vertical strip,

19

in other words why the column numbers in the path weakly increase as the replacements
go up, is reviewed in the proof of Lemma 3.3 below.
(iii) if T (r, λr) = 0 then the action of δr,λr on T is just to remove the corner cell (r, λr) =
(r, µr) of D(λ) and D(µ). This cell constitutes a deletion path consisting of a single
cell with a corresponding terminating row number r. It follows that type (iii) could be
included as a special case of type (ii), although this time the removed entry 0 is not
replaced by any non-zero entry.

While cases (i) and (iii) are rather trivial it is worth illustrating an example of case

(ii):
Example 3.2. In the case n = 6, λ = (9, 9, 6, 4, 1) and µ = (7, 5, 3) the action of δ4,4 on
a typical tableau T yields ˜T as shown:

(3.1)
In this example the path P has been marked in T by blue entries, with of course the
initial corner cell deleted in ˜T .

It might be noted that it is the Littlewood–Richardson property together with the fact
that the contents of a deletion path are strictly decreasing as one works up the tableau
that leads in cases of type (ii) to the deletion path terminating in row k with k ≥ 1. In
contrast to this in cases of type (i), if one performed the deletion as in cases of type (ii)
by means of deletions in the sense of Sagan and Stanley [SS90] starting from a corner
cell (r, λr) of T containing the row number r, then, due to the Littlewood–Richardson
property, the process would continue until it bumped a non-zero entry, namely 1, out of
row 1, i.e. it would be external. We avoid this as in [Aze99, Aze00, PV10] by restricting
the deletion to be just that of the single corner cell, but it explains why, in this situation,
the terminating row number is deﬁned to be zero.

One consequence of this is that in cases of type (i), while the semistandard property
is automatically preserved under deletion, the same is not always true of the lattice
permutation property. However, if T has no entries greater than r, including the case
ℓ(λ) = r, then it is easy to see that the type (i) deletion of the corner cell (r, λr) does
automatically preserve both the semistandard and the lattice permutation properties.
Similarly, it is easy to see rather trivially that both the semistandard and the lattice
permutation properties are preserved under deletions of type (iii). Moreover the deletion
procedure has been designed so that it also preserves both the semistandard and the
lattice permutation properties of tableaux under deletions of type (ii) as shown in the
following two lemmas.
Lemma 3.3. Let the partition λ have length ℓ(λ) ≤ n and let T be a semistandard
tableau of shape λ/µ for some µ ⊆ λ. If (r, λr) is a corner cell of D(λ) for which the

20

entry in T is strictly less than its row number r, then the action of δr,λr on T preserves
the semistandard property.
Proof: Let P be the deletion path corresponding to the action of δr,λr on T . Since
T (r, λr) < r, then as we saw earlier P terminates in some corner (k, µk) of D(µ). Let
cr > cr−1 > · · · > ck+1 > (ck =)0 be the entries of P in T . Removing the corner entry cr
from row r clearly does not aﬀect the semistandard property. For i = r, r −1, . . . , k +1 the
bumping process involves the rightmost entry ci from row i and say column j replacing the
rightmost entry ci−1 < ci in row i − 1 and say column l. This ensures that entries remain
weakly increasing from left to right across the row i − 1. Moreover the column strictness
of entries in T ensures that l ≥ j (this is why the deletion path forms a vertical strip). If
l = j the column strictness between rows i − 1 and i is preserved since after deletion ci
will lie immediately above either an empty site (outside the outer shape) if i = r or the
larger entry ci+1 that has replaced it in row i if i < r. If l > j then after deletion ci will
lie in row i − 1 immediately above either an empty site (outside the outer shape) or an
entry that was originally to the right of the rightmost ci in row i and is therefore greater
than ci. Thus the column strictness between rows i − 1 and i is preserved in column l.
That in column j is easier since, while the entry of the cell (i − 1, j) remains unchanged,
that of the cell (i, j) is now larger than before (or empty outside the outer shape). Thus
semistandardness is preserved.
(cid:3)
Lemma 3.4. Let the partition λ have length ℓ(λ) ≤ n and let T be a Littlewood–
Richardson tableau of shape λ/µ for some µ ⊆ λ. If (r, λr) is a corner cell of D(λ) for
which the entry in T is strictly less than its row number r, then the action of δr,λr on T
preserves the lattice permutation property.
Proof: As usual for each (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, we let Uij be the number of
entries i in row j of T and let βij be the number of entries i in rows 1 through j of T .
The lattice permutation inequalities for T take the form Lij = βi,j−1 − βi+1,j ≥ 0 for
1 ≤ i < j ≤ n.

Again let P be the deletion path corresponding to the action of δr,λr on T , and note that
since T (r, λr) < r, the path P terminates in a corner of D(µ). Let k be the terminating
row number and let cr > cr−1 > · · · > ck+1 > 0 be the entries of P in T . Then as a result
of the deletion operation βcr,r−1, βcr−1,r−2, . . . , βck+1,k each increase by one, and all other
βij stay the same. It follows that the inequality Lij = βi,j−1 − βi+1,j ≥ 0 in T may only
be lost if βi+1,j increases by 1 and βi,j−1 stays the same upon deletion. This implies that
along P an entry i + 1 is bumped from row j + 1 to row j where it either replaces an entry
0 or bumps an entry l from row j to row j − 1 with l < i. In both cases this can only
occur if j + 1 ≤ r ≤ n and Ui+1,j+1 = βi+1,j+1 − βi+1,j ≥ 1 and Uij = βij − βi,j−1 = 0. It
follows that Lij = βi,j−1 − βi+1,j = βij − βi+1,j ≥ 1 + βij − βi+1,j+1 ≥ 1, where in the ﬁnal
step use has been made of the fact that Li,j+1 = βij − βi+1,j+1 ≥ 0. Since Lij is therefore
≥ 1 before the deletion along P and the deletion can only diminish it by at most 1, the
condition Lij ≥ 0 is maintained after deletion. Thus the lattice permutation property is
preserved.
(cid:3)

These Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4 enable us to prove in the following Lemma 3.5 that the

21

deletion procedure preserves the Littlewood–Richardson nature of a tableau. In order to
specify changes of outer and inner shapes and weights we deﬁne ǫi ∈ Zn with ith entry
equal to 1 and all other entries 0, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Lemma 3.5. Let ℓ(λ) = n. The deletion operator δn,λn on T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) maps T to
˜T , with ˜T ∈ LR((λ − ǫn)/µ, (ν − ǫn)) if νn > 0, and ˜T ∈ LR((λ − ǫn)/(µ − ǫk), ν) if νn = 0
and the terminating row number is k with 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
Proof:
If νn > 0 there is nothing to prove. The lattice permutation rule ensures that
there is at least one entry n in row n, and the operator δn,λn just removes the cell (n, λn)
with entry n from T . The resulting tableau ˜T is clearly in LR((λ − ǫn)/µ, (ν − ǫn)).

If νn = 0 and λn > µn so that T (n, λn) is non-zero and less than n, then δn,λn performs
the usual type (ii) deletion as described above along a deletion path P in T starting at the
corner cell (n, λn) of D(λ) and terminating in a corner (k, µk) of D(µ) with 1 ≤ k < n. It
follows from Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4 in the case r = n that the action of δn,λn preserves both
the semistandard and the lattice permutation property. Having emptied the cell (n, λn)
and ﬁlled the cell (k, µk) with a non-zero entry we have ˜T ∈ LR((λ − ǫn)/(µ − ǫk), ν) as
claimed.

Finally, if νn = 0 and λn = µn so that T (n, λn) = 0, then the cell (n, λn) is removed
both from the inner shape µ and the outer shape λ, so that k = n and again there is
nothing to prove.
(cid:3)

We also require

Deﬁnition 3.6. For any given T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) with ℓ(λ) = r the full r-deletion operator
δr is deﬁned by

δr := δr,1δr,2 · · · δr,λr

(3.2)

Its action on T is realised by acting with δr,λr ﬁrst and δr,1 last. In general the action
proceeds in three phases:
in Phase 1 corner cells are deleted in turn as in case (i) until
there remain no entries r in row r, and then Phase 2 proceeds by means of deletion
operations as in case (ii) until there are no non-zero entries in row r. Finally, Phase 3
corresponds to the removal of the empty cells in row r as in case (iii). If ℓ(λ) < r the full
r-deletion is understood to be a null-operator.
Example 3.7. Given the tableau T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) as shown on the left below, the full
5-deletion operator δ5 = δ5,1δ5,2 acts on T to yield δ5 T on the right. The cell to be
deleted under the action of δ5,2 is outlined in green, and the deletion path deﬁned by the
action of δ5,1 is the set of cells outlined in red. The terminating row numbers of the paths
associated with the action of δ5,2 and δ5,1 are 0 and 2, respectively.

In this example we took the liberty of indicating the ﬁrst corner deletion and then
its successor path deletion on the same diagram. This is always possible since the cells
involved are quite distinct from one another. The same is true for any two successive
path deletions brought about by the action of δr,j and δr,j−1, as will be made clear in the
Horizontal Path Comparison Lemma below.

Before stating it, we provide some preliminaries. Let (r, λr) be a corner cell of D(λ)
and let P be the deletion path of δr,λr applicable to T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) with 0 < T (r, λr) < r
and terminating row number t (< r). Let λ♭ and µ♭ be deﬁned by D(λ♭) = D(λ)−{(r, λr)}
and D(µ♭) = D(µ) − {(t, µt)} respectively, so that δr,λr T has shape λ♭/µ♭, and set P ♭ =
P ∩ D(λ♭/µ♭) = P − {(r, λr)}. Then the bottom cell P ♭[r − 1] (resp. the top cell P ♭[t]) of
P ♭ is bounded at the bottom (resp. the top) by a horizontal segment of the outer border
(resp. the inner border) of D(λ♭/µ♭).
In general, for any skew LR tableau, a vertical
strip P ♭ ascending from a cell bounded at the bottom by a horizontal segment of its
outer border to a cell bounded at the top by a horizontal segment of its inner border,
and containing one cell of its shape from every row in between, determines as illustrated
below the following subsets of the shape of the tableau: that subset strictly to the left of
P ♭ which, by convention, also includes everything below the row where P ♭ starts, and that
subset weakly to the right of P ♭, that is the union of P ♭ itself and the subset strictly to
the right of P ♭ which, again by convention, also includes everything above the row where
P ♭ terminates. If P ♭ is obtained from a deletion path P by removing its starting cell and
if there would be no confusion, these subsets are also called strictly to the left of P and
so on.

In the example below on the left, the cell marked by

is the starting cell of P and
form P ♭. The plain white region shows the subset strictly to the left of
those marked by
P , the dots ﬁll the subset strictly to the right of P , which is joined by the cells
to form
the subset weakly to the right of P . Below on the right is an example of part of some
shape λ#/µ# containing the same P ♭ and whose bottom and top cells are the bottom and
top nonempty cells in their respective columns.

After a deletion along P starting from (r, λr), another deletion path P ′ could start
either from any corner strictly to the left of P or from one weakly to the right of P ,
according to which the entire new deletion path P ′ lies either strictly to the left of P or

23

weakly to the right of P , due to the type of argument used repeatedly since [Kn70, proof
of Theorem 1](Knuth) in dealing with insertions rather than deletions, see also [Sch63,
Remarque 2] (Sch¨utzenberger). We now include a proof of this claim not only for the sake
of maintaining a self-contained presentation but also to take this opportunity to generalise
it in a manner to be used later.
Lemma 3.8.
[Elementary Path Comparison] Let T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν), (r, λr) a corner of
D(λ) such that T (r, λr) < r and P the deletion path of δr,λr applied to T with terminating
row number t. Set T ′ = δr,λr T ∈ LR(λ♭/µ♭, ν) where λ♭ and µ♭ are deﬁned as above.
Moreover, let T # be an LR tableau of some shape λ#/µ# containing the same vertical
strip P ♭ = P − {(r, λr)} having the same entries as in T ′, with its bottom cell (resp.
top cell) bounded below (resp. above) by a horizontal segment of the outer (resp. inner)
border of D(λ#/µ#). Let (r′, λ#
r′) < r′ and P #
the deletion path of δr′,λ#

r′) be a corner of D(λ#) such that T #(r′, λ#
applied to T # with terminating row number t′.

r′

(1) Suppose that (r′, λ#

r′) lies strictly to the left of P , and that the part of T # to the left
of P coincides that part of T ′ (and hence that part of T as well). Then the entire
P # runs strictly to the left of P , and we have t′ ≥ t.

(2) Suppose that (r′, λ#

r′ ) lies weakly to the right of P (in this case the part of T # strictly
to the left of P can be diﬀerent from that part of T ′ so long as the assumptions
made before part (1) are satisﬁed). Then the entire P # runs weakly to the right of
P , and we have t′ < t.

Remark 3.9. Note that the assumptions for T # in both cases (1) and (2) are satisﬁed by
the tableau T ′ = δr,λrT , so that both statements (1) and (2) are applicable, in particular,
to a deletion occurring immediately after δr,λr . In addition, we can (and will) apply (2)
after performing several deletions from T ′ so long as they do not change the contents of
P or stack any cells above the terminating cell of P (see the proof of the Vertical Path
Comparison Lemma 3.11 below).

Proof. As in Deﬁnition 3.1, let P [s] denote the cell of the path P in row s for any applicable
s. This notation will be used for other deletion paths as well.

The claim (1) is obviously true if P # terminates in or below row r, that is if t′ ≥ r.
So we consider the case where t′ < r. Note that P # lies strictly to the left of P in rows
r and lower since everything in such rows is considered to be strictly to the left of P ♭ by
convention. Now we proceed by decreasing induction on the row number i, with t ≤ i < r
and assume that P #, having run strictly to the left of P in rows > i, enters row i. Note
that, since i < r, the cell P [i + 1] exists, at least in T . Since P #[i + 1] lies strictly to
the left of P [i + 1] by the induction hypothesis, we have T #(P #[i + 1]) = T (P #[i + 1]) ≤
T (P [i + 1]) = T ′(P [i]) = T #(P [i]). This means that the candidate entries T #(P #[i]),
which must be < T #(P #[i + 1]), can only lie strictly to the left of P [i] in row i of T #, so
that P # proceeds strictly to the left of P [i], including the possibility of terminating there
with t′ = i ≥ t. If i = t, P # must terminate there since P [t] is the leftmost nonempty cell
in row t of T #. This inductively shows that the entire path P # runs strictly to the left
of P , and also that t′ ≥ t.

24

On the other hand, the claim (2) is obviously true if r′ < t, so we assume r′ ≥ t and
again proceed by decreasing induction on the row number i, with r′ ≥ i ≥ t. The initial
case i = r′ is covered by the assumption in (2) that P #[r′] is weakly to the right of P [r′].
If r′ > i ≥ t, we have T #(P #[i + 1]) ≥ T #(P [i + 1]) = T ′(P [i + 1]) > T ′(P [i]) with the
ﬁrst inequality following from the induction hypothesis on the location of P # in row i + 1,
and the next equality following from the equality of entries in T # and T ′ along P , while
the second inequality is the preserved evidence of the deletion along P . Thus the entry
T #(P #[i + 1]) goes to the cell P [i] or somewhere to its right, that is to say P #[i] lies
weakly to the right of P [i]. Since this continues up to i = t, in particular the deletion
δr′,λ#
(cid:3)

applied to T # still bumps something from row t, we have t′ < t.

r′

In our setting where the starting cells of the deletions are taken ﬁrst from right to
left in row n, then from right to left in row n − 1 and so on, these considerations can be
usefully organized in the form of the following two lemmas, the ﬁrst of which is already
clear.
Lemma 3.10.
[Horizontal Path Comparison] Let T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) with ℓ(λ) = r. Con-
sider the full r-deletion operator δr = δr,1 · · · δr,λr applied to T . Let P and P ′ denote the
deletion paths of δr,j and δr,j−1 in this sequence, where 2 ≤ j ≤ λr − νr, and let t and t′
be their terminating row numbers. Then P ′ runs strictly to the left of P , and we have
t′ ≥ t.
Proof: This is immediate from part (1) of Lemma 3.8.

(cid:3)

The second one, which is helpful in considering the action of δr followed by that of

δr−1, is slightly less straightforward.
Lemma 3.11.
[Vertical Path Comparison] Let T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) with ℓ(λ) = r and recall
that Uir is the number of entries i in row r of T . Phase 1 of the action of δr on T removes
all Urr cells containing entries r in row r, and we divide Phase 2 of δr into Phase 2A
and Phase 2B: Phase 2A consists of the Ur−1,r type (ii) deletions starting from the cells
containing r − 1 in row r, and Phase 2B consists of the remaining type (ii) deletions
starting from cells with non-zero entries ≤ r − 2. We set m = λr − νr − Ur−1,r − µr,
that is the number of deletions in Phase 2B of δr. Then it is to be noted that Phase 2 of
δr−1 applied to T # := δrT has at least m deletions, since δr has just delivered m nonzero
entries ≤ r − 2 to row r − 1. For each j ∈ N in the range 1 ≤ j ≤ m, let Pj (resp. P #
j )
denote the path of the jth deletion operation, in the order of occurrence, in Phase 2B of
δr applied to T (resp. Phase 2 of δr−1 applied to T #). Let tj (resp. t#
j ) be the terminating
row number of Pj (resp. P #
runs weakly to the right of Pj,
and we have t#
Example 3.12. In the case λ = (9, 6, 5, 4), µ = (6, 5, 2) and the following LR tableau T ,
as shown on the left, we have r = 4, λr = 4, µr = 0, νr = 0 and Ur−1,r = 1 so that m = 3.

The Phase 2A of δ4 = δ41δ42δ43δ44 applied to T consists only of the deletion δ44which
produces the deletion blue path in T ; the Phase 2B consists of deletions δ43, δ42 and δ41, in

The deletions in Phase 2A of δr carry entries r − 1 from row r to row r − 1, which
form a contiguous segment immediately to the left of any original r − 1 in row r − 1. The
deletions in Phase 2B of δr then carry smaller entries into row r − 1, which settle in cells
further to the left. Moreover, these cells P1[r − 1], P2[r − 1], . . . , Pm[r − 1], which may
or may not be contiguous, lie from right to left in this order, due to the Horizontal Path
Comparison Lemma 3.10. Hence, for each 1 ≤ j ≤ m, the starting cell P #
j [r − 1] of P #
j ,
being the jth rightmost cell to the left of the entries r − 1 in row r − 1 of T #, lies weakly
to the right of Pj[r − 1]. Part (2) of Lemma 3.8 then implies the required result, namely
that P #
j < tj, provided only that immediately before
j
the deletion δP #
j , satisﬁes all the assumptions regarding in
this instance Pj − {Pj[r]} implied by the hypotheses of Lemma 3.8.

j [r−1] starts, the tableau, say T #

lies weakly to the right of Pj and t#

To establish this we use induction on j. First assume that j = 1. By the Horizontal
Path Comparison Lemma 3.10, no deletions in δr occurring after δP1[r] alter the contents of
P1, nor do they put any entries above P1[t1] since they terminate in rows ≥ t1. Moreover,
all operations between the end of δr and the beginning of δP #
1 [r−1] are Phase 1 deletions
which simply remove the cells in row r − 1 lying strictly to the right of P1, so after these
operations the contents of P1 − {P1[r]} are still preserved, and the cell P1[r − 1] (resp.
P1[t1]) is still bounded below (resp. above) by a horizontal segment of the outer (resp.
inner) border of T #
1 .

Now assume that 2 ≤ j ≤ m. By the Horizontal Path Comparison Lemma 3.10,
the deletions in δr occurring after δPj[r] do not alter the contents of Pj, nor do they put
any entries above Pj[tj] since they terminate in rows ≥ tj. Now, by the Horizontal Path
Comparison Lemma 3.10 applied to Pj−1 and Pj, Pj−1 lies strictly to the right of Pj, and
P #
j−1 runs weakly to the right of Pj−1 by the induction hypothesis. Moreover, again by

26

the Horizontal Path Comparison Lemma 3.10, this time applied to P #
j−1, these
paths all lie strictly to the right of Pj (symbolically we have · · · < Pj+1 < Pj < Pj−1 ≤
P #
j−1 < · · · < P #
1 ). Hence, including the Phase 1 deletions in δr−1, all operations occurring
between δPj [r] and δP #
j [r−1] leave the contents of Pj untouched, and the cell Pj[r − 1] (resp.
Pj[tj]) is still bounded below (resp. above) by a horizontal segment of the outer (resp.
inner) border of T #
j .

1 , . . . , P #

By the induction argument this shows, as required, that T #

j does satisfy all the con-
ditions of the preamble in Lemma 3.8 for all j = 1, 2 . . . , m, thereby completing the proof
of the current Lemma.

4 Bijective map from LR(λ/µ, ν) to LR(λ/ν, µ)

With our deletion operators we are able to construct from any LR tableau T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν)
a partner LR tableau S ∈ LR(λ/ν, µ). To do so we empty the initial LR tableau T by
performing a sequence of deletion operations, from right to left across each row in turn
from bottom to top. This renders it empty and simultaneously allows us to build the ﬁnal
LR tableau S from the data on the row number of the starting cell and the terminating
row number of each deletion path.

To accomplish this, we use a formulation in which the initial T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) and the
ﬁnal S ∈ LR(λ/ν, µ) are associated with pairs (T (n), S(0)) and (T (0), S(n)), respectively,
where T (n) = T , S(n) = S and both S(0) and T (0) are empty tableaux, and we introduce
operators that modify both components of pairs.
Deﬁnition 4.1. For an LR tableau T with no more than n rows, set T (n) = T and
let S(0) be an empty tableau. Then let ∆(n) denote the operation which transforms the
pair (T (n), S(0)) into another pair ∆(n)(T (n), S(0)) := (T (0), S(n)) through the action of
a succession of n operators ∆n, ∆n−1, . . . , ∆1 that produce pairs (T (r), S(n−r)), with
r = n − 1, n − 2, . . . , 0, respectively, as indicated by

(T (n), S(0)) ∆n

∆n−1

(4.1)

where each ∆r maps (T (r), S(n−r)) to (T (r−1), S(n−r+1)) by applying the operation δr deﬁned
in Deﬁnition 3.1 to the left-hand component T (r), so that T (r−1) = δrT (r), and by placing
a new row on top of the right-hand component S(n−r) to produce S(n−r+1), with this row
consisting of cells containing the terminating row numbers of this δr operation, including
zeros, arranged from left to right across the new row in the order in which they are
identiﬁed under the action of δr. We call the tableau S(n) the partner tableau of T (n).

To see that the prescribed operations are applicable, note that, by repeated use of
Lemma 3.4, T (r) is an LR tableau with outer shape (λ1, . . . , λr). S(r) will be a certain
tableau of shape (λr+1, . . . , λn) with zero and positive entries, or in fact a ﬁlling of the
rows r+1 through n of the Young diagram D(λ) with such entries. In particular, T (0) is an
empty tableau, and S(n) is a ﬁlling of D(λ) with zero and positive entries. Furthermore,
we have

27

Theorem 4.2. Let n be a positive integer and let λ, µ and ν be partitions such that
ℓ(λ) ≤ n and µ, ν ⊆ λ with |λ| = |µ| + |ν|. For each LR tableau T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) let
T (n) = T and let S(0) be an empty tableau. If we let ∆(n)(T (n), S(0)) = (T (0), S(n)) as in
Deﬁnition 4.1, then S = S(n) is a LR tableau and S ∈ LR(λ/ν, µ).

As a ﬁrst step towards proving this theorem we establish with the notation of Deﬁni-

tion 4.1 the following:
Lemma 4.3. Let µ(r) = (µ(r)
r ) denote the inner shape of T (r) for r = n, n −
1, . . . , 0. Then T (r) is an LR tableau of shape (λ1, . . . , λr)/µ(r) and weight (ν1, . . . , νr)
while S(n−r) is a tableau of shape (λr+1, . . . , λn)/(νr+1, . . . , νn) and weight µ − µ(r).

1 , . . . , µ(r)

Proof. The result is obvious for r = n in which case µ(n) = µ, T (n) has shape λ/µ and
S(0) is empty. So let us assume that the result has been veriﬁed for the pair (T (r), S(n−r))
for some 1 ≤ r ≤ n, and show the result for the pair (T (r−1), S(n−r+1)).

By Deﬁnition 4.1, we have T (r−1) = δrT (r). Recall from Deﬁnition 3.1 the three phases
of the action of δr which eventually shave oﬀ the whole row r from the outer shape of T (r).
Since, by the induction hypothesis, T (r) has no more than r rows and satisﬁes the lattice
permutation property, the entries r can only appear in row r. Moreover, the number of
such entries is νr since none can have been removed under the action of δs for s > r. Hence,
as described in Lemma 3.5, the operations in Phase 1 delete all νr entries r from T (r),
thereby reducing the weight from (ν1, . . . , νr) to (ν1, . . . , νr−1). The operations in Phases
2 and 3 do not remove any nonzero entry, so this weight remains unchanged. However,
in general they remove some cells from the inner shape of T (r), including all inner cells
in row r, making the new inner shape µ(r−1) (by our choice of notation). Since the LR
property is maintained, again by Lemma 3.5, it follows that T (r−1) is an LR tableau of
shape (λ1, . . . , λr−1)/µ(r−1) and weight (ν1, . . . , νr−1).

By Deﬁnition 4.1, S(n−r+1) is constructed by placing on top of S(n−r) a new row
containing the terminating row numbers of the deletions ocurring in the application of δr
to T (r). This row has length λr since δr consists of λr deletion operations. Phase 1 consists
of νr type (i) deletions each producing a terminating row number 0. Then Phases 2 and 3
produce λr − νr nonzero terminating row numbers of weight µ(r) − µ(r−1). It follows by the
induction argument that the weight of S(n−r+1) is (µ − µ(r)) + (µ(r) − µ(r−1)) = µ − µ(r−1),
as required.
(cid:3)

Example 4.4. The situation is illustrated in the case n = 4 and r = 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 as follows.
On the left, at each stage, the red boxes represent the terminating cells of the deletion
paths that occur during Phases 2 and 3 of the operation δr, which form the skew shape
µ(r)/µ(r−1), while the green boxes represent the cells to be removed during Phase 1 of δr.
The tableaux T (r) are LR tableaux by Lemma 3.5. On the right, it may be noted that
the tableaux S(n−r) are all semistandard, and the ﬁnal one S(n) is an LR tableau. These
properties will be established in complete generality below.

To complete the proof of Theorem 4.2 we require two additional Lemmas. First, using

the same notation as before:
Lemma 4.5. For r = 0, 1, . . . , n each tableau S(r) is semistandard.

Proof. Again we can proceed by induction. Since it contains no cells, the empty tableau
S(0) is semistandard. Then by the induction hypothesis S(n−r) is semistandard. However,

29

as we have indicated in the proof of Lemma 4.3, S(n−r+1) is constructed by placing on
top of S(n−r) a new row of length λr that contains on its left νr terminating row numbers
0, followed from left to right by λr − νr non-zero terminating row numbers. As required
for semistandardness these automatically appear in weakly increasing order thanks to the
Horizontal Path Comparison Lemma 3.10.

Since S(n−r) also satisﬁes the strict vertical inequalities by the induction hypothesis,
the only remaining condition required to establish the semistandardness of S(n−r+1) is the
vertical condition between its newly added row and the top row of S(n−r) (assuming that
r < n). We verify this by applying the Vertical Path Comparison Lemma 3.11 with its r
replaced here by r + 1. Phase 2 of δr+1 is divided into Phases 2A and 2B with U = Ur,r+1
being the number of Phase 2A deletions (i.e. the number of entries r in row r + 1 of
T (r+1)). By construction, the top row of S(n−r) and the new row of S(n−r+1) are as in the
following picture (see the statement of Lemma 3.11 for the notation m, tj and t#
j ). Note
that the lattice permutation property of T (r+1) implies that entries r can lie in rows r
and r + 1 only, so that the number of entries r in row r of T (r+1) is νr − U, and implies
furthermore that νr − U ≥ νr+1, or equivalently that νr+1 + U ≤ νr.

By the Vertical Path Comparison Lemma 3.11 we have tj > t#
for 1 ≤ j ≤ m, which
j
implies that the cell immediately above tj in S(n−r+1) is either empty or ﬁlled with some-
thing ≤ t#
j , verifying the required strict vertical inequalities for these cells. Moreover,
since all entries in the new row are at most r, the inequalities for the cells containing
r + 1 and their respective immediate upper neighbours also hold. It follows that S(n−r+1)
is semistandard, and the induction argument then implies that S(r) is semistandard for
all r = 0, 1, . . . , n, as required.
(cid:3)

Secondly, again using the same notation as above, we have:

Lemma 4.6. S = S(n) satisﬁes the lattice permutation property.

Proof. . Note that the construction of S implies that µ(r)
k , namely the length of row k of
the inner shape of T (r), equals the number of entries k to be put in rows 1 through r of S.
Hence the lattice permutation property of S is equivalent to the inequalities µ(r−1)
≥ µ(r)
k+1
for 1 ≤ r ≤ n and 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 and, moreover, it is suﬃcient to restrict to the range
1 ≤ k < r ≤ n since otherwise the inequality trivially holds (since µ(r−1) and µ(r) have at
most r−1 and r parts respectively). The required inequality again follows from Horizontal
Path Comparison Lemma 3.10, namely from the fact that the terminating row numbers
in Phases 2 and 3 in δr weakly increase in the order of occurrence, as follows. Let Vkr
denote the number of the terminating row numbers k generated during Phases 2 and 3 of

k

30

k − µ(r−1)

δr, that is to say Vkr = µ(r)
. Then, among the λr − νr relevant deletions, the ﬁrst
V1r terminate in row 1, the next V2r terminate in row 2, and so on, continuing until the
ﬁnal Vrr terminate in row r (this last part is nothing but Phase 3). Observe the change
of inner shape, noting that after each deletion it always has to be the Young diagram
of a partition. This in particular implies that V1r cannot exceed µ(r)
since, if the
inner shape D(µ(r)) loses this number of cells from row 1 with the length of row 2 intact,
then it will not have a corner in row 1 any more; so we have µ(r−1)
1 − V1r ≥ µ(r)
2 .
Next, before the deletions terminating in row 2 start, the lengths of rows 2 and 3 of
the inner shape are still µ(r)
respectively, and by the same argument we have
2
µ(r−1)
k+1 for all
2
1 ≤ k ≤ r − 1, and the lattice permutation property of S is ensured.
(cid:3)

3 . Proceeding in this manner, we obtain µ(r−1)

2 − V2r ≥ µ(r)

and µ(r)

Finally, we have

Proof of Theorem 4.2. Taken together Lemmas 4.3, 4.5 and 4.6 ensure that the tableau
S = S(n) is of shape λ/ν and weight µ, and that it satisﬁes both the semistandard
It is therefore an LR tableau and, more precisely,
and lattice permutation properties.
S ∈ LR(λ/ν, µ), as required.
(cid:3)

Remarkably, the map we have constructed from T = T (n) to S = S(n) is bijective. The

following lemma clariﬁes the basis of the proof of injectivity.
Lemma 4.7. Let n, λ, µ, ν, T and S be as in Theorem 4.2, and let (T (n), S(0)),
(T (n−1), S(1)), . . . , (T (0), S(n)) be as in Deﬁnition 4.1. Then, for each 1 ≤ r ≤ n, the
pair (T (r), S(n−r)) can be recovered from the sole knowledge of (T (r−1), S(n−r+1)) in the
following manner.

• S(n−r) consists of the lowermost n − r rows of S(n−r+1).

• Let Vkr denote the number of entries k in the top row of S(n−r+1) for 0 ≤ k ≤ r,
including entries 0 (in fact V0r equals νr, but we shall set aside this fact for the
moment). Then T (r) can be obtained from T (r−1) by applying Sagan and Stanley’s
internal insertion [SS90] from row k precisely Vkr times with k running from 1 up to
r in this order, and then adjoining V0r entries r to the right of the existing entries
in row r.

Proof. The assertion for S(n−r) is immediate from the construction. Now, again by con-
struction, the composition of the top row of S(n−r+1) tells that the full r-deletion applied
T (r), yielding T (r−1), consists of V0r type (i) deletions producing entries 0 in the top row
of S(n−r+1), then Vkr type (ii) deletions terminating in row k and producing that many
entries k in the top row of S(n−r+1), with k running from 1 up to r − 1 in this order, and
ﬁnally Vrr type (iii) deletions terminating in row r and producing that many entries r in
the top row of S(n−r+1). This ensures that it is possible to apply Sagan and Stanley’s
internal insertion to T (r−1) ﬁrst from each row k precisely Vkr times with k running from
r down to 1 in this order (note that the ﬁrst Vrr insertions from row r simply create that
many empty cells in row r), all reaching row r, and ﬁnally to adjoin V0r entries r to the

31

right of whatever already exists in row r, and that the result of these operations coincides
with T (r).
(cid:3)

Now the bijectivity is made explicit in the following:

Theorem 4.8. Let n, λ, µ and ν be as in Theorem 4.2, and let ρλ
LR(λ/µ, ν) to LR(λ/ν, µ) that takes T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) to S ∈ LR(λ/ν, µ) by way of

µ,ν be the map from

T 7−→ (T, ∅) ∆(n)

7−→ (∅, S) 7−→ S .

(4.2)

Then ρλ

µ,ν is a bijection from LR(λ/µ, ν) to LR(λ/ν, µ).

Proof. Let T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) and let (T (r), S(n−r)), r = n, n − 1, . . . , 0, be as in Deﬁni-
tion 4.1. Now start with the pair (∅, S) = (T (0), S(n)) and apply Lemma 4.7 with r = n,
n − 1, . . . , 0 in this order to successively recover (T (1), S(n−1)), . . . , (T (n), S(0)) = (T, ∅).
Hence one can tell what T was by the sole knowledge of ρλ
µ,νT . This proves that the
map ρλ
µ,ν from LR(λ/µ, ν) to LR(λ/ν, µ) is injective, and hence we have the inequality
|LR(λ/µ, ν)| ≤ |LR(λ/ν, µ)|. Now a special feature of our situation is that we also have
a map ρλ
ν,µ going from LR(λ/ν, µ) to LR(λ/µ, ν) deﬁned in the same manner but with
the roles of µ and ν interchanged, since the construction works for any shape and weight
(the sizes have to match but that condition is symmetric in µ and ν), and by applying
the same argument to ρλ
ν,µ we also deduce |LR(λ/ν, µ)| ≤ |LR(λ/µ, ν)|. So these two sets
have the same cardinality, and it is ﬁnite. So any injection from one to the other is also
a surjection. Hence the map ρλ
(cid:3)

µ,ν in the Theorem is a bijection.

Remark 4.9. With more eﬀort, it can be proved that the above recovering procedure
based on the internal insertion and adjunction described in Lemma 4.7 is applicable to
any S ∈ LR(λ/ν, µ) and that it yields an element of LR(λ/µ, ν), without assuming that
S comes from a T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) via the map ρλ
µ,ν, for an illustrative example see [Aze99,
Aze00]. This allows one to prove the bijectivity without resorting to the ﬁniteness of
cardinalities. This strategy will be adopted in the language of LR hives in Section 9.

In the next section it will be proved that the collection of maps ρλ

µ,ν has an involutory
nature in the sense that the composition of maps ρλ
µ,ν is the identity. This means that
the inverse map from LR(λ/ν, µ) to LR(λ/µ, ν) mentioned in the previous paragraph,
based on internal insertion and adjunction, actually coincides with our original map ρλ
ν,µ
based on deletions. It follows that the insertion procedure of Lemma 4.7 provides another
method to obtain the map in the statement of Theorem 4.2.

5 Tableau proof of involutive nature of bijection

The aim of this section is to give a tableau-based proof of the involutive property of the
collection of bijections in the statement of Theorem 4.8. To be more precise, let ρ(n)
denote the map

ρ(n) : LR(n) → LR(n)

32

deﬁned by way of

ρ(n) : T 7−→ (T, ∅) ∆(n)

7−→ (∅, S) 7−→ S.

It follows that for λ, µ and ν satisfying (*)

ρ(n)(LR(λ/µ, ν)) = LR(λ/ν, µ) with ρ(n)(cid:12)(cid:12)LR(λ/µ,ν) = ρλ

µν

µν is as deﬁned above in Theorem 4.8.

where ρλ
Theorem 5.1. The bijection ρ(n) is an involution.

The rest of this section constitutes a proof of Theorem 5.1 fulﬁlling in complete gen-

erality the strategy developed in [Aze00].

The case n = 1 is easy, since if ℓ(λ) ≤ 1, then both LR(λ/µ, ν) and LR(λ/ν, µ) consist
of single elements. Having this as the base case, we prove Theorem 5.1 by induction on n.
Let n ≥ 2 and T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) ⊆ LR(n), and set ∆(n)(T, ∅) = (∅, S), namely S = ρ(n)T .
It is convenient to let S− denote the tableau obtained from S by removing the nth row.
The inductive nature of the construction of ρ(n) is such that S− can be regarded as the
output of ρ(n−1) applied to δnT ∈ LR(n−1) since S− is just the rows 1, 2, . . . , n−1 of S. By
induction, we can assume that ρ(n−1)(S−) = δnT . Our goal is to show that ρ(n)(S) = T .
Since we do not do this yet, we write T ′ for ρ(n)(S) for the moment. Suppose we can
prove the following
Proposition 5.2. Let n ≥ 2 and S ∈ LR(n), and set T ′ = ρ(n)(S). Set T ′′ = ρ(n−1)(S−).
Then we have δnT ′ = T ′′. Namely the following diagram commutes:

Let λ, ν and µ be the outer shape, the inner shape and the weight of S respectively,
namely S ∈ LR(λ/ν, µ). The validity of Proposition 5.2 means that both T and T ′ are
transformed into the same tableau T ′′ = ρ(n−1)(S−) by δn. Moreover, T and T ′ both have
shape λ/µ and weight ν. Hence, whether one starts with (T, ∅) or (T ′, ∅), the one-row
semistandard tableau created by ∆n on the right-hand side consists of νr empty cells
created in Phase 1 and, if we let µ(n−1) denote the inner shape of T ′′, exactly µk − µ(n−1)
entries k with k running from 1 up to n − 1 in this order, all created in Phase 2, and
ﬁnally µn entries n created in Phase 3; namely, if one denotes this one-row tableau by R,
we have ∆n(T, ∅) = ∆n(T ′, ∅) = (T ′′, R). By Lemma 4.7 we have T = T ′.
So the proof of Theorem 5.1 is now reduced to that of Proposition 5.2.

33

We ﬁrst deal with the special case where row n of S consists of exactly one cell, but
afterwards we will argue that the general case can be reduced to this special case. We
start with some particularly easy special cases.
Lemma 5.3. If λn = 1 and the cell (n, 1) is empty in S, then Proposition 5.2 holds.

Proof. Consider applying ∆(n) to S to produce T ′, as in Deﬁnition 4.1. In applying ∆n,
the only deletion δn,1 is of type (iii), and produces a single cell containing n on the right-
hand component, where the word right (and left also, which will appear presently) is
chosen in accordance with the computation of ρ(n)(S), i.e. the pairs (S, ∅) and (∅, T ′).
Hence the left-hand component at this stage, δnS, coincides with S−, and applying δn−1,
. . . , δ1 to it produces the same rows on the right-hand component as does applying ∆(n−1)
to (S−, ∅). This means that T ′ consists of T ′′ = ρ(n−1)(S−) plus one cell (n, 1) containing
n. Applying δn to T ′ incurs a Phase 1 deletion only, which removes the cell (n, 1) and T ′′
is what is left. Hence Proposition 5.2 holds in this case.
(cid:3)

Lemma 5.4. If λn = 1 and S(n, 1) = n, then Proposition 5.2 holds.

Proof. Consider applying ∆(n) to S to produce T ′, as in Deﬁnition 4.1. In applying ∆n,
only Phase 1 arises, removing the cell (n, 1) and producing a single empty cell on the
right-hand component. Aside from this diﬀerence, the situation is very much similar to
the preceding case, and the validity of Proposition 5.2 in this case follows by the same
argument.
(cid:3)

We treat one more case separately, which not only is a special case but also serves as
the terminating step of an iteration occurring in a more general case to be discussed next.
Lemma 5.5. If λn = 1 and S(n, 1) = n − 1, then Proposition 5.2 holds.

Proof. In once again applying ∆(n) to S to produce T ′ as in Deﬁnition 4.1, the operation
δn applied to S consists of a single operation δn,1. It brings the bottom entry n − 1 to
row n − 1, where it replaces the rightmost entry < n − 1 in that row, which we call y
and, unless y = 0, incurs further bumping. Let P0 denote this deletion path, and l its
terminating row number. In applying δn−1 to δnS, after the removal of the entries n − 1 in
Phase 1, the Phase 2 and 3 deletions start from the cells in row n − 1 strictly to the left of
P0[n − 1] (see Deﬁnition 3.1 (ii) for this notation). Let P1, P2, . . . , Pm (m = λn−1 − µn−1)
denote these deletion paths, and k1, k2, . . . , km their terminating row numbers. The
bottom two rows of T ′ produced by these operations are as follows.

Now consider S− the tableau obtained fom S be deleting its nth row, and apply ∆(n)
to produce T ′′, again as in Deﬁnition 4.1. In applying δn−1, after the removal of entries
n − 1 in Phase 1, the ﬁrst Phase 2 or 3 deletion starts from the cell P0[n − 1] containing
y, and since the rows n − 2 and above, if any, are the same as those of S, this deletion
proceeds along the path P −
:= P0 − {(n, 1)} and terminates in row l. The remaining
0
Phase 2 and 3 deletions start from the cells in row n − 1 to the left of P0[n − 1] containing
entries x1, x2, . . . , xm, and since the portion of the current tableau to the left of P −
0
is the same as that portion of δnS, these deletions proceed along the paths P1, P2, . . . ,
Pm, and terminate in rows k1, k2, . . . , km respectively. The Horizontal Path Comparison
Lemma 3.10 applied to the operation δn−1 for S− assures that l ≤ k1 (≤ · · · ≤ km). The
bottom row of T ′′ produced by these operations is as follows.

At this stage we have δn−1S− = δn−1δnS, so that the upper n − 2 rows of T ′′ and
T ′, produced by applying δ1 · · · δn−2 to them respectively, are the same. The diﬀerence
between T ′ and T ′′ is exactly that will be incurred by applying δn to T ′, which consists of
a single operation δn,1, pushing the bottom entry l into the rightmost empty cell of row
n − 1 and terminating there. Thus Proposition 5.2 is veriﬁed in this case.
(cid:3)

Using Lemma 5.5 as a base case, we want to prove the following by induction on

n − S(n, 1).
Lemma 5.6. If λn = 1, the cell (n, 1) of S is nonempty and S(n, 1) ≤ n − 1, then
Proposition 5.2 holds.

We take this opportunity to introduce some notation which helps compactify certain

expressions in the proofs that follow.
Deﬁnition 5.7. (1) For any tableau T and a natural number k, we let k{T (resp. k{T ) de-
note the tableau consisting of the topmost (resp. bottommost) k rows of T . Occasionally
we apply the same notation for a deletion path P as well.

(2) If T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) with ℓ(λ) ≤ r, in which case we have deﬁned δr = δr,1 · · · δr,λr ,
r (using i as a superscript, not a subscript) for the ith piece of this

we may also write δi
sequence of operations in the order of application, namely

δi
r = δr,λr+1−i,

so that

δr = δλr
r

· · · δ1
r .

It may be noted that, in the construction of the partner tableau, the terminating row
number of the operation δi

r is to be placed in the cell (r, i).

(3) If T is a tableau of shape λ/µ, s ∈ N and if (r, c) is not a cell of D(λ/µ) but if
D(λ/µ) ∪ {(r, c)} is another skew Young diagram, then we write T ∪(r,c) s for the tableau
obtained from T by adjoining a cell (r, c) containing the entry s.

(4) Suppose that a letter e ∈ N is given.

ℓ(λ) ≤ r − 1 such that T ∪(r,1) e is again an LR tableau, then we let ˆδr,1T = ˆδ e
the LR tableau δr,1(T ∪(r,1) e ). The terminating row number of the operation ˆδ e
to T refers to that of the deletion δr,1 applied to T ∪(r,1) e .

If T is a LR tableau of shape λ/µ with
r,1T denote
r,1 applied

The following provides an essential inductive step to prove Lemma 5.6 by way of
showing that delaying, so to speak, the deletion from the bottom cell of S (please refer
to the statement of Proposition 5.8 for the exact meaning of this) retains the result of
deletion on S itself but corresponds to a single bumping step on the part of its partner
tableau.

(2) Let l′ be the terminating row number of the operation ˆδn,1 applied to S−. Moreover,
let R′ = (k′
λn−1) be the sequences of terminating
row numbers produced by the operation δn−1 applied to ˆδn,1S− (= δn,1S) and S−
respectively (which will constitute the rows n − 1 of T ′ and T ′′ respectively). Fur-
thermore, let l′′ be the rightmost entry in R′ strictly smaller than l′. Then we have
l′′ > 0, and R′′ coincides with what is obtained from R′ by replacing this entry by
l′. Moreover, l′′ equals the terminating row number of the operation ˆδn−1,1 applied
to δn−1S−.

In this section, we grant the truth of Proposition 5.8 and continue with the proof of
Lemma 5.6, then Proposition 5.2, which yields Theorem 5.1 as we saw after the statament
of Proposition 5.2. The proof of Proposition 5.8 will be given in Section 6.

Proof of Lemma 5.6. Set e = S(n, 1) as in the statement of Proposition 5.8. If n − e = 1,
then Lemma 5.5 readily shows the validity of Proposition 5.2 in this case. So let us assume
that n − e ≥ 2. In this case we can apply Proposition 5.8. What it says can be read as
follows. If one applies ρ(n) to S, then δn,1 yields the terminating row number l′ and then
δn−1 yields the row R′ of terminating row numbers; these form 2{T ′, and the remaining
operations yield n−2{T ′, where the notation of part (1) of Deﬁnition 5.7 has been used.
Note that this whole procedure can also be described as applying δ1 · · · δn−2 · δn−1 · ˆδn,1
to S−. We compare this with applying the following operations to S: ﬁrst temporarily
remove the entry e at (n, 1), apply δn−1, and then adjoin e back to (n − 1, 1) and apply
δ1 · · · δn−2δn−1; in other words applying δ1 · · · δn−2 · ˆδn−1,1 ·δn−1 to S−. Then δn−1 yields the
row R′′ of terminating row numbers, ˆδn−1,1 yields l′′ by part (2) of Proposition 5.8, and
since ˆδn−1,1δn−1S− = δn−1ˆδn,1S− by part (1) of Proposition 5.8, the operations δ1 · · · δn−2
again yield n−2{T ′. This is illustrated in the middle picture of (5.2) below; note that this
three part middle picture is not meant to be a tableau, although the adjunction of l′′ to
n−2{T ′ at (n − 1, 1) is in fact an LR tableau (this follows easily from the LR property of
T ′ and the fact that l′′ was one of the entries in row n − 1 of T ′), which we temporarily
denote by T ∗.

(5.2)
Moreover (2) also says that, if one applies δn,1 to T ′, then l′ changes row n − 1 from
R′ to R′′, bumping l′′. By the deﬁnition of deletion operation, this bumped element l′′
continues to change n−2{T ′ exactly as it would do if one applied the operation δn−1,1 to
T ∗; hence what we are trying to show is that 1{T ′′ = R′′ and that n−2{T ′′ = δn−1,1T ∗.

That 1{T ′′ = R′′ is clear from the deﬁnitions. On the other hand, if we set S∗ =
(δn−1S−)∪(n−1,1) e , then S∗ is also an LR tableau since S∗(n−2, 1) equals either S(n−2, 1)
or S(n − 1, 1) and the weight of n−2{S∗ is the same as that of n−1{S, and the description
above shows that ρ(n−1)S∗ = T ∗. Since S∗ contains e, which is ≤ n − 2, in the cell
(n−1, 1), we can apply the induction hypothesis to S∗, which shows that δn−1,1ρ(n−1)S∗ =
ρ(n−2)(n−2{(S∗)), and since n−2{(S∗) = δn−1S−, we have ρ(n−2)(n−2{(S∗)) = ρ(n−2)δn−1S− =
n−2{(ρ(n−1)S−) = n−2{T ′′, as desired.
(cid:3)

Example 5.9. Before proceeding with the proof of Proposition 5.2, we explain in the

case where n = 5, λ = (9, 9, 6, 4, 1), µ = (7, 5, 3) and S =

1 2 2 3

(so that

S = S− ∪(5,1) 3 ), is reached by ﬁrst applying Proposition 5.8 n − S(n, 1) times and then
ﬁnishing by Lemma 5.5.

The computation of ρ(5)S = T ′ (resp. ρ(4)S− = T ′′) consists of transforming the tableau

S (resp. S−) following the route

S

δ5,1→ S(4) δ4→ S(3) δ3→ S(2) δ2→ S(1) δ1→ S(0) = ∅
(resp. S− δ4→ S−(3) δ3→ S−(2) δ2→ S−(1) δ1→ S−(0) = ∅)

(5.3)

(5.4)

(see the diagram (5.7) below), and piling up the terminating row numbers shown in
the diagram in blue letters accompanying the
arrows in the case of the bottom
deletions, and those shown in red letters accompanying the
arrows in the case of
the other deletions, into a tableau T ′ (resp. T ′′) shown in (5.8).

The operator ˆδ5,1 = ˆδ 3

δ5,1→ S(4) of (5.3)
ˆδ5,1→ S(4) without aﬀecting the terminating row numbers being produced, thereby

5,1 enables us to rewrite the initial portion S

as S−
making both routes to consider start from the same tableau S−.

Since S(n, 1) ≤ n−2 we can apply Proposition 5.8 to S, whose purpose is twofold: one
is to show the validity of the conclusion of Proposition 5.2, δ5,1(ρ(5)S) = ρ(4)S−, in rows
5 and 4; the other is to pass the task of showing its validity in the remaining upper rows
to a recursive application of Lemma 5.6 to S∗ = δ4S− ∪(4,1) 3 = S−(3) ∪(4,1) 3 (where
3 = S(5, 1)), namely to comparing the tableaux obtained from the routes

S∗ δ4,1→ (or S−(3)

ˆδ4,1→ ) S(3) δ3→ S(2) δ2→ S(1) δ1→ S(0) = ∅ and
S−(3) δ3→ S−(2) δ2→ S−(1) δ1→ S−(0) = ∅.

(5.5)

(5.6)

The claims in part (2) of Proposition 5.8 serve the ﬁrst purpose: the diagram gives l′ = 2,
R′ = (1, 1, 2, 3) and R′′ = (1, 2, 2, 3), so that l′′ = 1 (the rightmost entry < l′ in R′),
which veriﬁably coincides with the terminating row number 1 given by ˆδ4,1 = ˆδ 3
4,1 applied
to S−, and R′′ coincides with the result of replacing the rightmost 1 of R′ by 2. Due to
ˆδ5,1S− = ˆδ4,1δ4S− in part (1) of Proposition 5.8, namely the commutativity
the claim δ4
of the upper rectangle in (5.7) in terms of the transformations of S−, one veriﬁes by
chasing the route (5.5) in the diagram that ρ(4)S∗ piles up the upper three rows of ρ(5)S
over the cell (4, 1) containing the element l′′ = 1 bumped from R′, and since ρ(3)S∗− is
just the upper three rows of ρ(4)S−, the conclusion of the recursively applied Lemma 5.6,
δ4,1(ρ(4)S∗) = ρ(3)S∗−, will take care of the equality δ5,1(ρ(5)S) = ρ(4)S− in rows 1, 2 and
3.

In general, applying Lemma 5.6 to S∗ may again need invoking Proposition 5.8, in
which case it is worth noting that S∗(n−1, 1) = S(n, 1) since it ensures that the operation
ˆδn−1,1 deﬁned in the context of S and that of S∗ are indeed the same operation. In this

39

example, however, S∗ already meets the requirements of Lemma 5.5 since S∗(4, 1) = 3 =
4 − 1, which directly gives δ4,1(ρ(4)S∗) = ρ(3)S∗−: the lower row of (5.8) indeed veriﬁes
that δ4,1 places l′′ = 1 into the empty cell (3, 2) of ρ(4)S∗ and yields ρ(3)S∗−.

This completes our Example 5.9.

Combining Lemmas 5.3, 5.4 and 5.6, we have

Lemma 5.10. If λn = 1, then Proposition 5.2 holds.

Finally, using Lemma 5.10, we give the following inductive step for proving Proposi-

tion 5.2 by induction on λn.
Lemma 5.11. Let S be as in Proposition 5.2, and assume that λn > 0. Let S← denote
the tableau obtained from S by erasing the cell (n, 1) and shifting each of the remaining
cells in row n to the left by one column. Note that S← ∈ LR(n). Then we have ρ(n)S← =
δn,λnρ(n)S.

Proof. We are comparing the partner tableaux of S and S←. The drawings in Eq. (5.9)
1 and 5 are the tableaux S and S←
below endeavours to illustrate the relationship.
respectively. The fat black arrows denote migration to the respective partner tableaux: 1
to 4 and 5 to 8 . The claim is that the partner 8 for S← coincides with the transform
of the partner 4 for S by a single deletion δn,λn, starting with the entry denoted by x in
the drawing. Note that row n of 4 is drawn detached from the rest of the tableau. This
is to show an arrow connecting the cell (n, λn) to row n − 1. As we shall see towards the
end of the proof, that is one point to which we shall return.

· · · δ1

n

As an intermediary, consider 2 S′

:= δλn−1
n . The symbol δ′

nS, the result of applying the n-
deletion δn without the ﬁnal deletion δλn
n above the arrow going from
1 to 2 represents this shorter combination, and the three red wavy lines in 1 and the
three black wavy lines in 2 indicate the deletion paths associated to the application of
δ′
n to S, assuming in the picture that all its consituents are type (ii) deletions, and with
the convention that b∗, c∗ and d∗ denote the uppermost nonzero entries of the respective
paths starting from the cells containing b, c and d, and that the empty red squares above
them in 1 , which become dotted and ﬁlled squares in 2 , are their terminating cells. If
some of these deletions are of type (i) or type (iii), the corresponding wavy lines in the

41

pictures are just symbolic, the actual changes being limited to the removal of the starting
cells.

· · · δ1

n

If we apply δλn−1

n to S← instead, which amounts to applying the full n-deletion
δn in this case, the deletions carve the same changes except for their starting cells being
shifted to the left, as indicated by the red wavy lines in 5 and the black wavy lines in
6 , possibly symbolic, and leave the tableau 6 which coincides with the result, n−1{S′, of
the removal of the cell (n, 1) from S′.

Since S′ has only one box in row n, Lemma 5.10 assures, by way of Proposition 5.2,
that the partner on the lower level 7 coincides with the transform of the partner 3 for
S′ by a single deletion δn,1 indicated by the blue wavy line with the same convention as
the red wavy lines in 1 and the black wavy line in 7 indicating the result of shifting.
Again δn,1 can be of type (i) or (iii), and then the wavy line is symbolic with the change
actually limited to the removal of the starting cell. Note that such a case occurs exactly
when the deletions δn,1 from 1 and 2 are of type (iii) or (i) respectively.

Next we compare the partners 4 for S and 3 for S′. Note that S′ appears in the

42

process of applying ∆n to (S, ∅) as a left-hand side component. At that point, the cells
(n, 1) through (n, λn − 1) on the right-hand side component, namely those cells of the
partner 4 , have been constructed by placing the terminating row numbers of the red
wavy paths shown in 1 , indicated by i, j and k in the drawing.
If we continue, the
remaining deletion δn,1 applied to S′ produces a terminating row number, denoted by x
in the drawing, to be placed at (n, λn) of 4 , and then δn−1, . . . , δ1 produce rows n − 1
through 1 of 4 . If we start from S′ to produce 3 instead, the transformations of the
left-hand side components are exactly the same, but the terminating row number of the
ﬁrst deletion δn,1 for S′, which is also x, is placed at (n, 1), and the rows n−1 through 1 of
3 , produced by the continuing deletions δn−1, . . . , δ1, are exactly the same as those of 4
as indicated by the = sign in the drawing. Thus, the tableau 4 can be described as being
obtained from 3 by moving the cell (n, 1) to (n, λn) and placing the terminating row
numbers of the possibly symbolic red wavy lines in 1 in cells (n, 1) through (n, λn − 1).
Similarly, or even more simply, the partner 8 for S← can be described as the partner 7
for 6 plus a row consisting of the terminating row numbers of the red wavy lines shown
in 5 , attached as row n. Note again that these terminating row numbers, indicated by
i, j and k in the drawing, are exactly the same as those of the red wavy lines shown in
1 , in other words the contents of the cells (n, 1) through (n, λn − 1) of 4 .

Since the topmost n − 1 rows of 4 are exactly the same as those of 3 , the ﬁrst
deletion δn,λn for 4 and the ﬁrst deletion δn,1 for 3 , both starting with the entry denoted
by x in the drawing and hence belonging to the same type, follow the same path, if they
are of type (ii), and incur the same changes (no changes in the case of type (i) or (iii))
in the topmost n − 1 rows of 4 and 3 respectively. This claim in the case of type (ii)
is veriﬁed by consulting Deﬁnition 3.1, according to which the deletion path proceeds
iteratively from the current cell by looking for the rightmost cell in the row immediately
above which contains an entry stricty smaller than that of the current cell, which ensures
that the deletion path is determined by the value of the starting entry and the tableau
above the starting row, regardless of the column position of the starting entry. However,
at ﬁrst sight it may sound suspicious to claim that the path obtained from the blue wavy
line in 3 by moving the starting cell to the right still constitutes the beginning of a valid
deletion path if one worries about the possibility of moving the entry x in 3 too far to the
right to form a vertical strip. The point is that how far x is moved to the right is bounded
by the semistandardness of the tableau 4 that is itself constructed as the partner of the
originally given tableau S. Then as reviewed in the proof of Lemma 3.3 this automatically
assures that the path generated according to Deﬁnition 3.1 is a vertical strip.
(cid:3)

Now we can state the proof of Proposition 5.2, thereby concluding the proof of Theo-

rem 5.1.

Proof of Proposition 5.2. If λn = 0, then S and S− coincide, and T ′ and δnT ′ coincide,
so the conclusion is immediate. If λn > 0, then we can apply Lemma 5.11 successively to
S, S←, (S←)← and so on, to show that ρ(n−1)S− is obtained from ρ(n)S by applying δn,λn,
δn,λn−1, δn,λn−2 and so on, namely by applying δn, as required.

6 Proof of Delaying Bottom Cell Deletion lemma

This whole section constitutes the proof of Proposition 5.8. This rather long proof tries
to organize its course of logic by putting some intermediate claims in lemmas, which form
layers as in (6.1). This means that the proof of Proposition 5.8 states, proves and uses
Lemmas 6.1, 6.2 and 6.10 (plus some narrative text augmenting some minor points), and
the proof of Lemma 6.2 has a similar structure, and so on.

We begin by applying Vertical Path Comparison Lemma 3.11 to S, where δn,1 is
a Phase 2B deletion, which shows that R′ contains at least one nonzero entry strictly
smaller than l′. Hence we have l′′ > 0.

Now note that δn−1

be the deletion path of the operation ˆδn,1 (actually that of the δn,1 part of this operation)
applied to S−.

Let i∗ be the smallest i such that the paths P ′

i and P ′ have at least one cell in common,
and call i∗ the ﬁrst contact index. Such i exists since the deletion starting from P ′[n − 1]
is in Phase 2 and does share the cell P ′[n − 1] with P ′; moreover the minimality of i∗
implies that the starting cell of P ′

i∗ is weakly to the right of P ′[n − 1].

With i∗ thus deﬁned, let us relate it with the place where the replacement of l′′ by l′

occurs in the transition from R′ to R′′.

of the outer (resp. inner) border, with contents of P ′ − {(n, 1)} unaltered after ˆδn,1: this
is because the starting cell of P ′
i is strictly to the right of P ′[n − 1] and, by induction, the
earlier deletions in δn−1 have occurred only strictly to the right of P ′, keeping P ′[n − 1]
(resp. P ′[l′]) bounded below (resp. above) by a horizontal segment of the outer (resp.
inner) border and also keeping the contents of P ′ − {(n, 1)} unaltered, so that part (2) of
Lemma 3.8 assures that P ′

and the starting cell of P ′

Now assume that P ′

δr,2 to this tableau, performing the deletion starting from the cell containing S(P ′[r]),
then it proceeds along r−1{P ′, yielding (r−1{δn,1S) ∪(r,1) S(P ′
i∗+1[r]) . If one compares this
tableau with (r−1{S!)∪(r,1) S(P ′
i∗+1[r]) , the diﬀerences are limited to the region to the right
of r−1{P ′. Furthermore, if one applies δr,1 to this latter tableau, performing the deletion

(r−1{S!) ∪(r,1) S(P ′

that k′

Now we consider the following operations D(i), 0 ≤ i < λn−1, that interpolate between
δn−1ˆδn,1 and ˆδn−1,1δn−1 (to be applied to S−), and observe how the resulting tableaux
change (or rather do not change) and how the sequences of terminating row numbers
change.

On the other hand, the operation ˆδn−1,1δn−1, which should be the other end of the in-
terpolation, does not appear to be present among the operations D(i), but we shall see
below in Lemma 6.10 that it has the same eﬀect on S− as D(λn−1−1), and also that
the terminating row numbers produced by applying ˆδn−1,1δn−1 to S− coincides with
R(λn−1−1) = R′′ · l′′ = (k′′

Proof. The proof of Lemma 6.2 will be further divided into sublemmas. Let us begin
by verifying the statements (1) and (2) for i < i∗, where i∗ is the ﬁrst contact index
introduced before Lemma 6.1.
Lemma 6.4. For i < i∗, each of the operations δ1

Hence the statements (1) and (2) of Lemma 6.2 hold for these i.

since ˆδn,1 passes row n − 1 by carrying e ≤ n − 2 into a cell to the left of all (n − 1)’s in
row n − 1 of S− and hence deferring this operation until after the type (i) deletions from
row r − 1 does not change anything.

n−1 since
at every stage the rightmost entry strictly smaller than the entry coming from the row

or not. So these two operations, upon exchanging the order of applications, follow the
same paths bumping exactly the same elements. Combined with the induction hypoth-
esis, we have ˆδn,1δi
ˆδn,1S−, so that the remaining operations

incur the same transformations on these two. Hence ˆδn,1 also commutes

This immediately implies the statement (1): D(i)S− = D(0)S−. Moreover, since the
paths are the same, the terminating row numbers are also the same, including the zeros
obtained from type (i) deletions, except that l′, obtained from ˆδn,1, comes ﬁrst in D(0)
whereas in D(i) it comes in between k′

This validates the statement (2).

Reverting to the proof of Lemma 6.2, what we have just shown, namely Lemma 6.4,
ﬁnishes the proof of Lemma 6.2 in the special case where i∗ = λn−1, since it covers all
values of 0 ≤ i < λn−1 in the statements (1) and (2) of Lemma 6.2 in this case.

So we assume that i∗ < λn−1 in the remainder of the proof of Lemma 6.2.
Then we reach a crucial step which we call the case of ﬁrst contact, namely changing
D(i∗−1) into D(i∗) by exchanging the order of ˆδn,1 and δi∗
n−1, which are their i∗th and
(i∗ + 1)th operations in the order of application. Note that the sequence expected for
R(i∗) in the statement (2), (k′
1, . . . , k′
λn−1), would derive from
the already established R(i∗−1) = (k′
λn−1) by switching
its (i∗ + 1)th and (i∗ + 2)th terms rather than the i∗th and (i∗ + 1)th terms. Thus,

Proof. We prove this by investigating closely the paths taken by the three relevant oper-
ations in D(i∗) over Lemmas 6.6, 6.7 and 6.8 below.
For that purpose, let (r∗, c∗) be the cell where P ′
i∗ and P ′ ﬁrst meet, i.e. the lowest cell
i∗ ∩ P ′, which we call the cell of ﬁrst contact. We divide the tableaux into three parts:
of P ′
the part below row r∗ (which we call the lower part), the part consisting of a single row
r∗ and the part above row r∗ (the upper part).

Let us start by looking at the lower part, which is easy.

Lemma 6.6. Below row r∗, the operations δi∗
i∗ and P ′
respectively, bumping the same entries as in D(i∗−1) including the ones bumped from row
r∗ + 1 into row r∗, with the order of ocurrence switched from that in D(i∗−1).

n−1 and ˆδn,1 in D(i∗) take paths P ′

Hence the lower parts of S′

2 coincide, and accordingly the next operation δi∗+1
n−1
in D(i∗−1) in D(i∗) utterly coincides below r∗, including the entry it bumps into row r∗. In
particular, the lower parts of S′

2 and S′′

3 also coincide.

3 and S′′

Proof. The ﬁrst claim can be proved by arguing similarly to the case i < i∗ since, below
the cell of their ﬁrst contact, the path P ′
i∗ lies strictly to the right of P ′. The remaining
claims follow easily from the ﬁrst one.

Lemma 6.7. The operations ˆδn,1, δi∗
n−1 in D(i∗−1), respectively, go through the
cells (r∗, c∗), (r∗, c∗) and (r∗, c∗ − 1) in row r∗. The operations δi∗
n−1 in D(i∗)
(now arranged in the order of application in D(i∗)) go through the cells (r∗, c∗), (r∗, c∗ − 1)
and (r∗, c∗ − 1) in row r∗, respectively.

the cell (r∗, c∗ − 1)) may be inside the inner shape of S′
0, or in other words x or y can be
0. The notation such as hxi and hyi is used in (6.3) as a reminder of this situation. The
position (r∗, c∗ + 1), represented by a dotted box in (6.3), may be outside the outer shape,
and notation such as (z) used in (6.3) signiﬁes this situation. The blue box P ′[r∗ + 1]
always exists in S′

This implies u > y. When we say “bumps hyi to row r∗ − 1”, it is to be understood that
if y = 0 no actual entry is bumped out of row r∗ but the deletion terminates in row r∗.

1 (r∗, c∗), the letter u enters the cell (r∗, c∗ − 1), conﬁrming the statement for
ˆδn,1 in D(i∗), and it bumps hxi to row r∗ − 1. Finally the third operation δi∗+1
n−1 , proceeding
along P ′
i∗+1[r∗ + 1]) into row r∗. Since the lower parts
of S′
i∗+1[r∗ + 1]) = w. Moreover, since
w > u (see (6.4)) = S′′
2 (r∗, c∗), the letter w enters the
cell (r∗, c∗ −1), conﬁrming the statement for δi∗+1
2 (r∗, c∗ −1) = u
to row r∗ − 1.

i∗+1[r∗ + 1]) = S′
2 (r∗, c∗ − 1) and w ≤ v (see S′

1 (P ′[r∗ + 1]) = u into row r∗. Since u > y ≥ x = S′′

i∗+1 in the lower part, bumps S′′

n−1 in D(i∗), and it bumps S′′

2 coincide, we have S′′

2(P ′
1) = S′′

2 and S′′

3 and S′′

We have seen that both S′

3 have w in the cell (r∗, c∗ − 1), v in the cell (r∗, c∗)
and the same entries as S′
0 elsewhere in row r∗, and that the entries bumped to to row
r∗ − 1 by the three operations in the order of application, hyi, u and hxi in the case of
D(i∗−1) and hyi, hxi and u in the case of D(i∗), are switched between the second and the
third operations. Thus the proof of Lemma 6.7 is ﬁnished in the case r∗ < n − 1.

If r∗ = n − 1, the path P ′ starts from row r∗ + 1, while P ′

i∗+1 start from row r∗.
So v and w do not exist, and the cell (r∗, c∗ +1), if it exists in S−, has been removed by the
operation δi∗−1
n−1 , so that z does not exist either. One can easily see that the transformation
also proceeds as shown in (6.3) if one ignores the cells containing parenthesized entries,
so the same conclusions as in the case r∗ < n − 1 hold.
(cid:3)

i∗ and P ′

Now we look at the upper part.

Lemma 6.8. Above row r∗, the operations δi∗
P ′, P ′
takes the same path, namely ˆδn,1, δi∗+1

n−1 in D(i∗) take the paths
i∗ respectively, bumping the same entries as the operation in D(i∗−1) that

n−1, ˆδn,1 and δi∗+1

i∗+1 and P ′

n−1 respectively.

n−1 and δi∗

The upper parts of S′

3 coincide. The terminating row numbers given by the
three operations in D(i∗−1) and D(i∗), arranged in the respective orders of occurrence, are
switched between the second and the third.

3 and S′′

Proof. We ﬁrst deal with some easy cases. If both x and y are zero, the only letter sent
into row r∗ − 1 during the three operations is u, by δi∗
n−1 in the case of D(i∗−1) and by δi∗+1
n−1
in the case of D(i∗); in both cases the upper part of S′
0 is maintained until accepting the
letter u, so it causes the same deletion paths in both cases (which must be P ′
i∗ since it is
so in D(i∗−1)), leaving the upper part the same. Thus the statement is validated with the
upper parts of both P ′ and P ′
i∗+1 being empty in this case. If only x is zero, the letters
sent into row r∗ − 1 during the three operations are y and u, in this order in both D(i∗−1)
and D(i∗). So they incur the same deletion paths in both cases (which must be P ′ and P ′
i∗
respectively since they are so in D(i∗−1)), leaving the upper parts the same again. The
statement is again validated with the upper part of P ′

i∗+1 being empty.

50

1 and S′′

Now we assume that both x and y are positive. Both in D(i∗−1) and D(i∗), the ﬁrst
of the three relevant consecutive operations applied to S′
0 sends the same letter y to row
r∗ − 1 as we saw in Lemma 6.7. Hence it incurs the same bumping in both cases. Since we
know that it follows P ′ in D(i∗−1), it also follows P ′ in D(i∗), involving the same entries.
Hence the upper parts of S′
1 are identical. Now we compare the eﬀect of the
remaining two operations in the upper part. The second operation in D(i∗−1) starts by
bringing u (> y) into row r∗ − 1, and we know that its path P ′
i∗ lies weakly to the right of
P ′. On the other hand, the second operation in D(i∗) starts by bringing x (≤ y) into row
r∗ − 1. By applying the Horizontal Path Comparison Lemma 3.10 to an auxiliary tableau
0) ∪(r∗,1) x ∪(r∗,2) y , we see that its path, which we temporarily call P ′′ (actually
(r∗−1{S′
P ′
i∗+1 as we shall see instantly), lies strictly to the left of P ′. So the latter operation
keeps everything weakly to the right of P ′ unchanged, in particular the contents of P ′
i∗
and its right-hand side neighbours if any, so that the third operation in D(i∗), starting
with the same letter u as the second operation of D(i∗−1), also follows P ′
i∗; making the
contents of the upper part of P ′
2. On the other hand, the
second operation in D(i∗−1) does not change anything strictly to the left of P ′, including
the contents of P ′′, and each of its right-hand side neighbours either stays the same or
grows larger (the latter possibility can only occur if it is contained in P ′), so that the third
operation in D(i∗−1), starting with the same letter x as the second operation of D(i∗), also
i∗+1 = P ′′ in the upper part; making the contents of the
follows P ′′ and hence we have P ′
2 . We have seen that the upper parts of S′
upper part of P ′
3
and S′′
3 coincide, and that the terminating row numbers produced by the three operations
and D(i∗−1) and D(i∗) are switched between the second and the third operations, so the
statement of Lemma 6.8 is validated in this case.

The conclusions of Lemmas 6.6, 6.7 and 6.8 validate Lemma 6.5, and hence the state-
(cid:3)

ments (1) and (2) of Lemma 6.2 for i = i∗.

Continuing with the proof of Lemma 6.2, we show that the remaining cases where
i∗ < i < λn−1 can be proved by repeating the same argument as in the case of ﬁrst
contact.
Lemma 6.9. Let i be such that i∗ < i < λn−1. Then (δi−1
n−1S−) ∪(n,1) e , e =
S(n, 1), is an LR tableau satisfying the assumptions of Proposition 5.8, with ﬁrst contact
index equal to 1. Moreover, the statements (1) and (2) of Lemma 6.2 for S hold for these
values of i.

n−1 · · · δ1

Proof. Note that the tableau in the statement can be written as δi−1
n−1S. The initial
part of this sequence of deletions may be of type (i), namely removals of letters n − 1 from
row n − 1, but this cannot cause violation of the LR property since there are no entries n
in row n by the assumption on S in Proposition 5.8. The remaining operations preserve
the LR property due to Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4. Since row n of this tableau is the same as
that of S, it also satisﬁes the assumption of Proposition 5.8.

n−1 · · · δ1

Now we consider the case i = i∗ + 1, and denote this tableau by S∗ for simplicity. If we

actually P ′

1 for S∗ share a cell, (r∗, c∗ − 1) in the notation
the paths playing the roles of P ′ and P ′
for the proof of Lemma 6.5 (even though the cell of ﬁrst contact may be in a lower row),
and so the ﬁrst contact index for S∗ equals 1. By applying Lemma 6.5 to S∗, we conclude
that exchanging the order of ˆδn,1 and δi∗+1
1 results in the same tableau after
further applying δi∗+2
n−1 , with the terminating row numbers of the second and the third of
these three operations switched; namely that the statements (1) and (2) of Lemma 6.2
hold for i = i∗ + 1.

n−1 applied to S′′

If i∗+1 < λn−1−1, then we can repeat the same argument since the situation can again
be regarded as that after the case of ﬁrst contact, until we have shown the statements (1)
and (2) of Lemma 6.2 for all i ≤ λn−1 − 1.
(cid:3)

Lemmas 6.4, 6.5 and 6.9 cover all values of 0 ≤ i < λn−1 in statements (1) and (2) of
Lemma 6.2, and so the proof of Lemma 6.2 is ﬁnished in the case i∗ < λn−1 as well. (cid:3)

Finally, as we have anticipated in Remark 6.3, we have to compare

Lemma 6.10. We have D(λn−1−1)S− = ˆδn−1,1δn−1S−. Moreover, in applying ˆδn−1,1δn−1
to S−, the sequence of terminating row numbers produced by δn−1, R′′ by deﬁnition,
coincides with the sequence obtained by replacing the rightmost l′′ in R′ with l′, and the
terminating row number produced by ˆδn−1,1 coincides with l′′.

n−1

· · · δ1

Proof. Note that the part δλn−1−1
n−1 is common to both D(λn−1−1) and ˆδn−1,1δn−1.
Let S# denote the result of applying this part to S−. Then S# has only one cell (n − 1, 1)
in row n − 1. Hence, in D(λn−1−1), the next operation ˆδn,1 sends e, which it ﬁrst places
in the cell (n, 1), to (n − 1, 1), which continues to incur the same transformation as the
next operation δλn−1
in ˆδn−1,1δn−1 incurs on S#. So these two operations produce the
n−1
same terminating row numbers, and we have ˆδn,1S# = (δλn−1
n−1 S#) ∪(n−1,1) e . Hence the
in D(λn−1−1), applied to ˆδn,1S#, is identical with the δn−1,1 part of
ﬁnal operation δλn−1
n−1
the ﬁnal operation ˆδn−1,1 in ˆδn−1,1δn−1, applied to δλn−1
ˆδn,1S# =
ˆδn−1,1δλn−1
n−1 S# namely D(λn−1−1)S− = ˆδn−1,1δn−1S−, with the ﬁnal operations also giving
the same terminating row numbers. Hence the sequences of terminating row numbers
of D(λn−1−1) and ˆδn−1,1δn−1, both applied to S−, are the same. The former sequence is
R(λn−1−1) by deﬁnition, which is obtained from R′ by replacing the rightmost l′′ with l′
and then appending l′′ due to part (2) of Lemma 6.2 with i = λn−1 − 1. Hence the part
concerning the terminating row numbers is also veriﬁed.
(cid:3)

n−1 S#, so that we have δλn−1

This completes the rather long proof of Proposition 5.8.

Example 6.11. We use the same S as in Example 5.9. We illustrate in this case how
the delay of the bottom cell deletion from δ4ˆδ5,1 to ˆδ4,1δ4, namely the act of diverting
around the upper rectangle in (5.7), accompanied by the mutation of the resulting se-
quence of terminating row numbers, can be interpolated by considering the operations
D(i) introduced in Lemma 6.2.

Let us ﬁrst show in the diagram (6.5) the dim red paths P ′

4, from right
to left, taken by the operations δ1
4 to be applied successively to S− and, for
easy visual recognition, an additional very dim blue cell (5, 1) with entry 3 to make it S
and the slightly dim blue path P ′ taken by the operation δ5,1 applied to S. This shows
that i∗ = 2 with (3, 5) being the cell of ﬁrst contact.

rectangle, such as the dim orange patch in (6.7), the exchange of the terminating row
numbers exactly accompanies the exchange of operators, while in the case of diversion
around a hexagon such as the dim yellow and green patches, representing the exchange
between the ﬁrst and second terms in the three term sequence of operators to apply,
the exchange of terminating row numbers occurs between the second and third terms
in the corresponding three term sequence of terminating row numbers. The diversion
around the lowermost dim purple trapezium results in essentially the same sequence of
transformations, causing no change in the resulting terminating row numbers.

This whole diagram (6.7) is to ﬁt inside the top rectangle of the drawing (5.7). In
the notation of Proposition 5.8 and Example 5.9, the terminating row number produced
from the top ˆδ5,1 arrow is l′, those produced from the arrows on the right-hand (resp.

54

left-hand) edge of (6.7) form the sequence R′ (resp. R′′), l′′ is the term of R′ produced
by the second arrow from the top in this case. One can observe that, through the local
changes described above, l′ sneaks into the position of l′′ in R′ while most of R′ is copied
to R′′, l′′ being bumped out of the sequence and sent to the bottom ˆδ4,1 edge.

7 Path removals from a hive

By virtue of the bijection between Littlewood–Richardson tableaux and hives, the action
of deletion operators on tableaux corresponds to a path removal procedure in hives. Under
this bijection the three types of action (i), (ii) and (iii) of the deletion operator δr,λr on
an LR tableau T with a corner cell at (r, λr) as described in Deﬁnition 3.1 correspond to
three types of hive path removal that we now deﬁne.

It should be recalled ﬁrst that in any given hive a diagonal consists of all the triangles
in a strip parallel to the right hand boundary of the hive lying between an edge on the
base and a corresponding edge on the left hand boundary. Our convention is that the pth
diagonal is the one bounded by the edges λp and µp. Then by a path we mean a connected
set of edges extending from an edge on the base to an edge on either the left or right hand
boundary. Such paths are generally zig-zag in nature and proceed either up a diagonal or
horizontally leftwards from one diagonal to another. They consist of pairs of edges taken
from a sequence of neighbouring triangles always including their common edge.
Deﬁnition 7.1. For any given H ∈ H(r)(λ, µ, ν) with r = ℓ(λ) we may deﬁne three path
removal operators χr, φr and ωr whose action on H is to reduce or increase edge labels
by 1 along a path starting from the edge labelled λr on the base of the hive and speciﬁed
as follows:

(i) χr: if νr > 0 then the path consists of the edges labelled λr and νr, with both edge

labels decreased by 1;

(ii) φr: if λr − µr − νr > 0 so that Uir > 0 for some i < r then the path proceeds up
the rth diagonal from the edge labelled λr through upright rhombi of gradient 0
until it encounters an upright rhombus of positive gradient, at which point it moves
horizontally to the left into the (r − 1)th diagonal and proceeds up this diagonal
or to the left as before, and so on until it terminates on the left-hand boundary at
the top of the kth diagonal, that is at the edge labelled µk for some k such that
1 ≤ k < r, with all path α and γ edge labels being decreased by 1 and all path β
edge labels increased by 1;

(iii) ωr: if µr > 0 then the path proceeds directly up the rth diagonal until it terminates
on the left-hand boundary at level r, that is at the edge labelled µr, with all path
edge labels decreased by 1.

The three types of path are illustrated below. In each case the action of χr, φr and
ωr on the hive H is to decrease the label of each red edge by 1 and to increase that of
each blue edge by 1. In particular, under this action the edge label λr and one or other

55

of νr, µk (with k < r) or µr are each reduced by 1 to λr − 1 and νr − 1, µk − 1 or µr − 1,
respectively.

(7.1)
While the structure of the paths is rather simple in cases (i) and (iii), the structure of
the path in case (ii) is more complicated and consists of a sequence of ladders in each
diagonal from the rth to the kth. Each ladder consists of a continuous zig-zag of red α- or
γ-edges passing through upright rhombi of gradient 0 that extends up the diagonal from
an edge that is either on the base of the hive or the top of an upright rhombus that we call
the foot rhombus (coloured green), to an edge that is either on the left hand boundary or
the bottom of an upright rhombus that we call the head rhombus (coloured yellow), as
illustrated below:

head rhombus

ladder

>0

0

0

0

0

foot rhombus

(7.2)

The length of a ladder is the number of its rungs, that is to say the number of horizontal
red γ-edges. Thus the ladders starting at the base of the hive lack a foot rhombus, while
those ending on the left hand boundary lack a head rhombus. It might be noted that all
ladders, including these, may consist of a single red α-edge, in which case the length is
0. The passage between one diagonal and the next is by way of a blue β-edge parallel to
the right hand boundary. If such an edge is the lth from the top of the diagonal then its
level is said to be l.

Before using these path removals we ﬁrst establish that the action of each of the path

removal operators preserves the hive conditions, as follows:
Lemma 7.2. Let H be a hive in H(r)(λ, µ, ν) with r = ℓ(λ). Then the path removal
operators are such that if we set ˜H = χr H, φr H or ωr H with νr > 0, λr − µr − νr > 0
and µr > 0, respectively, then in each case ˜H is a hive.
Proof:

It is easy to see that the triangle conditions (2.6) are preserved under any of the

56

three path removal procedures mapping a hive H to ˜H by examining the changes to the
edge labels of elementary triangles as illustrated by:

(7.3)

Moreover all edge labels remain non-negative under the map from H to ˜H. This is
obvious in the case of all blue edge labels since they are increased by 1 in the passage from
H to ˜H. On the other hand red edge labels are each decreased by 1, so it is necessary to
show that each red edge label in H is positive.

This is clear in case (i) since the only two red edges are those labelled λr and νr, which
by hypothesis are positive. In case (ii) the fact that λr > 0 implies that all γ-edges in the
ﬁrst r diagonals of H carry positive labels, this includes all the red γ-edges labels. This
only leaves the red α-edges. On any given pth diagonal these are separated by upright
rhombi of gradient 0, so they all carry the same label. For p > k this label must be positive
since at the top of each the ladder there appears a head rhombus of positive gradient. In
the kth diagonal the shared red α-edge label is µk, and the fact that µk is also positive
follows from the application of the betweenness condition to the conﬁguration

> 0

µk

(7.4)

In case (iii) the hive conditions imply that the labels of all red γ-edges are ≥ λr and those
of all red α-edges are ≥ µr. These red edge labels must therefore all be positive since
by hypothesis λr > 0 and µr > 0. Thus all red edge labels of H are positive in all three
cases, and as a consequence all edge labels of ˜H are non-negative integers.

Turning next to rhombi, as a result of the path removals the requisite changes in red
and blue edge labels automatically change the gradients of certain elementary rhombi.
In order that ˜H be an LR hive it is necessary to show that all these gradients remain
non-negative.

In the case of a type (i) hive path removal the action of χr aﬀects only one rhombus

and does so as shown below:

L

νr

λr

χr
7−→

L+1

νr−1

λr−1

(7.5)

Clearly, the gradient of this rhombus is increased. It follows that all rhombus gradients
remain non-negative under the action of χr.

The situation is more complicated for type (ii) hive path removals under the action of
φr. From the deﬁnition of a type (ii) path, the upright rhombi between the foot and the
head rhombi all have gradient 0. The only upright rhombus gradients that are changed
under the action of φr are those of the foot and head rhombi which increase and decrease

57

by 1, respectively. In the case of the type (ii) example illustrated in (7.1) the changes in
upright rhombus gradients are then as indicated below:

µk

0
+1

−1
0

−1

0
+1

−1
0

+1

The only reductions in gradient are thus of the form:

λr

U

φr
7−→ U−1

(7.6)

(7.7)

However, since each head rhombus necessarily has positive gradient this conﬁguration
only arises if U > 0 so that U − 1 ≥ 0. As a result all upright rhombus gradients remain
non-negative after a type (ii) hive path removal.

The only right-leaning rhombi that undergo a reduction in gradient under a type
(ii) hive path removal generated by the action of φr are those subject to the following
transformation:

α R

α′

φr
7−→

α−1 R−1

α′

(7.8)

To preserve the validity of the corresponding hive condition it is therefore necessary to
show that in this case the initial gradient R = α − α′ is positive. It can be seen from (7.6)
that the only cases that arise are those of the following type:

α

R4
0
α

α4

R3
0
α

R2
0
α

α3

α2

α1
R1
0 > 0
α

α0

(7.9)

The fact that the parallel red edge labels α on the left of the diagram are identical, is a
consequence of the gradients of the intervening upright rhombi all being 0 as indicated by
the 0’s appearing on the horizontal red edges. On the right of the diagram the fact that
the relevant upright rhombi have non-negative gradients implies that α1 ≥ α2 ≥ α3 ≥ α4,
while the positivity of the gradient of the upright rhombus indicated in the diagram by > 0

58

on a horizontal black edge and coloured yellow ensures from the betweenness conditions
that α ≥ α0 > α1. Hence α ≥ α0 > α1 ≥ α2 ≥ α3 ≥ α4 so that Rk = α − αk > 0 for
all k, as required for the right-leaning rhombus condition to be maintained after the path
removal.

Still dealing with type (ii) hive path removals generated by the action of φr, the only
left-leaning rhombi that undergo a decrease in their gradients are those subject to the
following transformation:

β′

βL

φr
7−→ β′

L−1

β+1

(7.10)

This case can only arise as part of the following hexagonal initial conﬁguration:

β′′

β′′′

0 > 0
L

β

β′

(7.11)

In terms of the given edge labels the initial gradient of the lower left-leaning rhombus
of the type illustrated above is given by L = β′ − β. However the gradients of the two
upright rhombi speciﬁed in the diagram as 0 and > 0 ensure that β′ = β′′ and β′′′ > β.
In addition the gradient β′′ − β′′′ of the upper left-leaning rhombus must be non-negative.
Hence β′ = β′′ ≥ β′′′ > β. It follows that L = β′ − β > 0 so that L − 1 ≥ 0. This conﬁrms
that all rhombus gradients remain non-negative under the action of φr.

Finally, for a hive path removal of type (iii) as illustrated on the right of (7.1) the only

rhombi whose gradients change are those undergoing the map:

R

ωr
7−→

R+1

Thus all rhombus gradients remain non-negative under the action of ωr.

(7.12)

(cid:3)

Very much as in the tableau case we next introduce

Deﬁnition 7.3. For any given n-hive H ∈ H(r)(λ, µ, ν) with r = ℓ(λ), the path removal
operator θr,λr is deﬁned by

χr
φr
ωr

if νr > 0;
if νr = 0 and Uir > 0 for some i < r;
if νr = 0, Uir = 0 for all i < r, and µr > 0.

(7.13)

θr,λr =


With this deﬁnition of θr,λr we have

Lemma 7.4. Let ℓ(λ) = r. Then the hive path removal operator θr,λr maps any given
H ∈ H(r)(λ, µ, ν) to ˜H with (i) ˜H ∈ H(r)((λ − ǫr), µ, (ν − ǫr)) if νr > 0; (ii) ˜H ∈
H(r)((λ − ǫr), (µ − ǫk), ν) with 1 ≤ k < r if νr = 0 and Uir > 0 for some i < r; (iii)
˜H ∈ H(r)((λ − ǫr), (µ − ǫr), ν) if νr = 0, Uir = 0 for all i < r.

59

Proof: In each case we have established in Lemma 7.2 that ˜H is a hive. It only remains
to consider the changes of the hive boundary labels. It can be seen from (7.1) that the
only changes are a reduction by 1 of the labels λr and νr in case (i), λr and µk in case
(ii), and λr and µr in case (iii).
(cid:3)

Again very much as in the tableau case, we next introduce

Deﬁnition 7.5. For any given hive H ∈ H(r)(λ, µ, ν) with ℓ(λ) ≤ r the full r-hive path
removal operator θr is deﬁned by

θr := θr,1θr,2 · · · θr,λr ,

(7.14)

where it is to be understood that θr acts as the identity on H if ℓ(λ) < r. In general its
action on H proceeds in three successive phases: Phase 1 consists of νr hive path removals
of type (i); Phase 2 consists of λr − νr − µr hive path removals of type (ii); and Phase 3
consists of µr hive path removals of type (iii), so that

θr = ωµr

r φλr−µr−νr

r

χνr
r .

(7.15)

With this deﬁnition we have

Theorem 7.6. For a hive H ∈ H(r)(λ, µ, ν) with ℓ(λ) ≤ r let θrH = ˜H then ˜H ∈
H(r)(˜λ, ˜µ, ˜ν) with ˜λ = (λ1, . . . , λr−1, 0), ˜µ = (µ1 − V1r, . . . , µr−1 − Vr−1,r, 0) and ˜ν =
(ν1, . . . , νr−1, 0), where Vkr is the number of type (ii) hive path removals from H that ex-
tend from the boundary edge initially labelled λr to that initially labelled µk for 1 ≤ k < r.
Proof:
If ℓ(λ) < r then λr = µr = νr = 0 and there are no path removals so that Vkr = 0
for all k = 1, 2, . . . , r − 1. This implies that ˜λ = λ, ˜µ = µ, ˜ν = ν and ˜H = θrH = H ∈
H(r)(˜λ, ˜µ, ˜ν), as required. For ℓ(λ) = r the required result is an easy consequence of the
iterated use of Lemma 7.4. The edge label νr is reduced to 0 in Phase 1. At the same time
the edge label λr is reduced to λ −νr in Phase 1, then to λ −νr −µr in Phase 2, and ﬁnally
to 0 in Phase 3, in which the edge label µr is also reduced to 0. Meanwhile in Phase 2 the
parameters Vkr give the number of hive removal paths that reach the left-hand boundary
edge initiall labelled µk thereby reducing this label to µk − Vkr for k = 1, 2, . . . , r − 1. (cid:3)

Two further observations are of use in what follows.

Lemma 7.7. In the action of θr on H ∈ H(r)(λ, µ, ν) with ℓ(λ) = r if a hive path removal
of type (ii) follows a path P and reaches the left-hand boundary at level k, then the next
such removal follows a path P ′ lying weakly above the path P in each diagonal and reaches
level k′ with k′ ≥ k.
Proof: This can be seen by consideration of the following hive path removal diagram
in which two successive removal paths P and P ′ are illustrated, P in red, P ′ in blue and

60

their overlap in magenta.

k′

k

0

(7.16)

The interpretation of this is that the ﬁrst path P is the union of the red and magenta
edges, while the second path P ′ is the union of the blue and magenta edges. Working
from right to left the route of P ′ necessarily coincides with that of P , as shown in the initial
magentasection, unless and until it reaches an upright rhombus, indicated in purple,
whose initial gradient 1 was reduced to 0 by the removal of the path P . At this point the
paths separate but they may meet again, whereupon the path P ′ again must coincide with
that of P , as shown in the second magenta section, unless and until it reaches another
such upright rhombus, again indicated in purple, whose initial gradient 1 was reduced
to 0 by the removal of the path P . In such a case the paths separate again, and so on.
This observation guarantees that the path P ′ lies weakly above that of P and also that
it meets the left-hand boundary at an edge weakly above that reached by P .
(cid:3)
Corollary 7.8. Under the action of θr on H ∈ H(r)(λ, µ, ν) with ℓ(λ) = r let Vkr be
the number of type (ii) hive path removals reaching the left-hand boundary at level k for
1 ≤ k < r. Then for each such k

µk ≥ µk − Vkr ≥ µk+1.

(7.17)

Proof:
The ﬁrst inequality follows from the fact that Vkr ≥ 0. Then, by virtue of
Lemma 7.7, the left-hand boundary edge label µk+1 must remain unchanged under all Vkr
hive path removals reaching the edge labelled µk. Each one of these decreases this label by
1. The fact that the hive conditions are preserved under these hive path removals implies
that on the left-hand boundary the kth edge label must remain greater than or equal to
that of the (k + 1)th edge label. Thus after all Vkr path removals we have µk − Vkr ≥ µk+1,
that is the second inequality of (7.17).
(cid:3)

Our second observation is the following:

Lemma 7.9. Under the action of θr followed by θr−1 on H ∈ H(r)(λ, µ, ν) with ℓ(λ) = r,
let Nkr and Nk−1,r−1 be the number of type (ii) hive path removals occurring in the
action of θr and θr−1 that reach the left-hand boundary at or below levels k and k − 1,
respectively. Then

Nk−1,r−1 ≥ Nkr − Ur−1,r,

(7.18)

61

where Ur−1,r is the upright rhombus gradient at the foot of the rth diagonal of H.
Proof:
the action of θr on H is typically as shown below.

It should be noted that the impact of type (ii) hive path removals in Phase 2 of

We have illustrated two distinct types of path: on the left a path that passes from the rth
to the (r −1)th diagonal beneath the upright rhombus at the foot of the rth diagonal with
initial gradient Ur−1,r > 0 reduced to Ur−1,r − 1 ≥ 0 by the hive path removal, and on the
right a path that ﬁrst passes up the rth diagonal through at least one upright rhombus of
gradient 0 before entering the (r − 1)th diagonal. The number of the former is precisely
Ur−1,r and these are necessarily removed before any of the latter. Each of the latter leaves
immediately below it in each diagonal an upright rhombus whose gradient is increased by
1. These increases are cumulative since successive type (ii) hive path removals always lie
weakly above their predecessors, by virtue of Lemma 7.7.

Now consider the Nkr type (ii) hive path removals that extend from the rth to the
jth diagonal with 1 ≤ j ≤ k. If Nkr ≤ Ur−1,r then all these path removals are of the
form shown above on the left. In such a case Nk−1,r−1 ≥ 0 ≥ Nkr − Ur−1,r as required. If
Nkr > Ur−1,r then the ﬁrst Ur−1,r of these are again as shown on the left. Let the sequence
of the remaining nkr = Nkr − Ur−1,r of path removals of the type shown on the right
be P1, P2, . . . , Pnkr , with Pi+1 lying weakly above Pi in accordance with Lemma 7.7 for
i = 1, 2, . . . , nkr − 1. It follows that the sum of upright rhombus gradients in the (r − 1)th
diagonal of θrH is at least nkr. The action of θr−1 must reduce this sum of gradients to
0. It does so through a sequence of at least nkr hive path removals P ′
of
type (ii), again with P ′
i in accordance wth Lemma 7.7. Consider
ﬁrst the relationship between P1 and P ′
1 lies strictly below P1.
Under the action of θr, in each diagonal it enters, the path removal P1 leaves immediately
beneath it an upright rhombus of gradient ≥ 1, moving weakly upwards as the path
traverses the diagonals westwards (see the green upright rhombi in the right-hand picture
of (7.19)). This situation is unaltered by the removal of all subsequent type (ii) paths Pj
with j > 1 since these all lie weakly above P1. It also remains unaltered by the removal
of any necessary type (iii) paths under the action of θr and any necessary type (i) paths
under the action of θr−1. Hence the ﬁrst type (ii) path P ′
1 removed under the action of
θr−1, starting from the bottom edge of diagonal r − 1, must leave that diagonal below the

1. We wish to show that P ′

green rhombus in that diagonal. This puts P ′
1 in diagonal r − 2 below the green rhombus
in diagonal r − 2, and forces it to leave that diagonal below that rhombus. The situation
persists, and we conclude, as intended, that P ′
1 does lie strictly below P1. This argument
may be extended. Note that, following the removal of P ′
1, there will still remain in each
diagonal entered by P2 an upright rhombus of gradient ≥ 1 immediately below the path
P2. This is easy to see if the transition of P2 into that diagonal occurs strictly above that
of P1. If P2 enters that diagonal at the same level as P1, then the upright rhombus in
that diagonal immediately below them will have gradient ≥ 2, and even if the removal
of P ′
2 lies
strictly below P2. Continuing in this way it is clear that P ′
i lies strictly below Pi for all
i = 1, 2, . . . , nkr. Therefore at least nkr type (ii) paths removed under the action of θr−1
meet the left hand boundary at a level strictly below the level reached by Pnkr, which is
itself ≤ k. It follows that Nk−1,r−1 ≥ nkr = Nkr − Ur−1,r, as claimed.
(cid:3)

1 reduces that gradient by one it remains ≥ 1. It then follows as before that P ′

8 Path removal map from H(n)(λ, µ, ν) to H(n)(λ, ν, µ)

Armed with our path removal procedures we are able to exploit them to construct from
any hive H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) a partner hive K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ). To do so it is only necessary
to evacuate the initial hive H by performing a sequence of path removals that render
it empty and to build the ﬁnal hive K from the data on the location of the ﬁrst and
last edges on each path that is removed. In doing so one constructs a sequence of pairs
(H (r), K (n−r)) for each r = n, n − 1, . . . , 0 where H (r) is an r-hive and K (n−r) is an r-
truncated n-hive consisting of the rightmost n − r diagonals of some n-hive. These pairs
are such that H (n) = H and H (0) is the empty hive, signiﬁed here by a single point, while
K (n) = K and K (0) is an empty n-truncated n-hive, signiﬁed by a single boundary line
consisting of β-edges with labels µ1, µ2, . . . , µr.
Example 8.1. In the case n = 4 the map we are seeking is of the following type from
(H (4), K (0)) to (H (0), K (4)):

the pair (H (n), K (0)) to the pair Θ(n)(H (n), K (0)) := (H (0), K (n)) through the action of a
succession of n operators that produce pairs (H (r), K (n−r)), with r = n − 1, n − 2, . . . , 0,

The operator Θr is deﬁned to map the pair (H (r), K (n−r)) to (H (r−1), K (n−r+1)) as follows.
First H (r−1) is obtained from θr H (r) by the action of the operator κr introduced at the
end of section 2. This deletes the rth diagonal, which by construction is empty, so that
H (r−1) = κrθrH (r). In parallel with this, K (n−r+1) is obtained from K (n−r), by adding
to its left-hand boundary an rth diagonal of upright rhombi having gradients Vkr, with
boundary edge labels νr and λr at its top and bottom, respectively, and with right- and
left-hand boundary edge labels (µ(r)
r−1 ), respectively, where

Following this lengthy deﬁnition, it is convenient to exemplify each phase of the action
of Θr on the pair (H (r), K (n−r)). Before doing this it is helpful to introduce an operator
ζr whose action on a truncated hive K (n−r) with left hand boundary edge labels µ(r)
for

In this example it has been assumed that the hive path removal illustrated on the left is
the ﬁrst that terminates at the 3rd edge on the left-hand boundary, thereby reducing the
edge label µ(5)
2 have been reduced to
µ(4)
1 and µ(4)
2 , respectively, by the previous Phase 2 removal of two sequences of V15 and
V25 paths starting at the 5th edge on the lower boundary and terminating at the 1st and
2nd edges, respectively, on the left-hand boundary. As a result the edge label λ5 − ν5 has
been reduced to σ5 := λ5 − ν5 − V15 − V25. These previous hive path removals on the left
have dictated the insertion of the two upright rhombus gradients V15 and V25 appearing
on the right, and as a consequence the increase in the lower boundary edge label from
ν5 + µ(5)
5 + V15 + V25. Then the hive path removal on the left, whose route
5
is determined by the 0 upright rhombus gradients, gives rise to the insertion of an upright
rhombus gradient of 1 on the right along with a further increase of the lower boundary
edge label from τ5 to τ5 + 1. In Phase 2 this process continues until on the left the upright
rhombi in the 5th diagonal all have gradients equal to 0, with the initial edge label λ5 − ν5
reduced to µ(5)

However, no corresponding hive path additions to ζrK (n−r) are required because the ad-
dition of µ(r)

We are now in a position to state

Theorem 8.4. Let n be a positive integer and let λ, µ and ν be partitions such that
ℓ(λ) ≤ n and µ, ν ⊆ λ with |λ| = |µ|+|ν|. For each LR hive H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) let H (n) = H
and let K (0) be an n-truncated n-hive with edge labels µ. If we let Θ(n)(H (n), K (0)) =
(H (0), K (n)) as in Deﬁnition 8.2, then H (0) is an empty hive and K = K (n) is an LR hive
K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ). In such a case we write K = σ(n)H.
Proof:
From the iteration scheme of Deﬁnition 8.2 and the illustration of the action
of Θr in mapping (8.2) to (8.3) it is clear that K = K (n) will have boundary edge labels
λ, ν and µ.
In addition it can be seen that each Phase of the action of Θr preserves
the triangle condition at every stage. The possibility of an edge label becoming negative
arises only in the case of a Phase 2 type (ii) hive path removal as illustrated by the red
edge in (8.6). However, arguing inductively, the edge labels µ(n)
k = µk are non-negative
for 1 ≤ k < n. If, by the induction hypothesis the edge labels µ(r)
k are all non-negative
for 1 ≤ k < r then the Vkr Phase 2 removals have the eﬀect of reducing the edge initially
labelled µ(r)
k+1 ≥ 0 for 1 ≤ k < r − 1, where the penultimate
k
step follows from Corollary 7.8. Thus the edges labels µ(r−1)
for 1 ≤ k < r − 1 are all
non-negative. This completes the induction argument.

k − Vkr ≥ µ(r)

k

= µ(r)

k

As far as the gradients of elementary rhombi are concerned, all the upright rhombus
gradients Vkr are non-negative as they count the number of certain type (ii) hive path

68

removals. It remains to show that the left and right-leaning rhombus gradients are also
non-negative.

The (k, r)th left-leaning rhombus of K will have the edge labels indicated below

µ(r)
k

Vkr

Lkr

µ(r)
k+1

µ(r−1)

The gradient of the illustrated left-leaning rhombus is then given by

Lkr = µ(r−1)

k

− µ(r)

k+1 = µ(r)

k − Vkr − µ(r)

k+1 ≥ 0,

(8.8)

(8.9)

where the ﬁnal step is a consequence of Corollary 7.8 being applied in the case H = H (r).
Thus all left-leaning rhombi in K are non-negative.

Similarly, the (k, r)th right-leaning rhombus of K will have the edge labels determined

by the diagram shown below on the left.

(8.10)

In this diagram on the left, the edge labels νr and νr−1 are constrained by the hive
conditions for the sub-diagram of H (r) shown on the right. These imply that

νr−1 − Ur−1,r ≥ νr.

(8.11)

It follows that the right-leaning rhombus gradient is given by

Rkr = (νr−1 +

Vi,r−1) − (νr +

k−1

Xi=1

Xi=1

≥ Ur−1,r + Nk−1,r−1 − Nkr ≥ 0 .

(8.12)

where use has been made of Lemma 7.9.

Thus all elementary rhombus gradients of K are non-negative, and this completes the
proof that K is an LR hive. The boundary edge labels then ensure that K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ).

9 Creation of a hive by path additions

Having used a path removal procedure to provide a map from any H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) to
some K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ) we now wish to show that a path addition procedure may be used
to provide a map from any K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ) to some H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν). The aim is to
show that these two maps are mutually inverse to one another, thereby proving that each
is a bijection.

Our approach is to move successively from an (r − 1)-hive H (r−1) to an r-hive H (r)
In doing so it is necessary to
under a procedure dictated by the rth diagonal of K.
exploit ﬁrst the operator κ−1
that adds to H (r−1) an rth diagonal consisting of a sequence
of upright rhombi all of gradient 0, with its upper and lower boundary edge labels 0, and
with its remaining new edges given the unique labels that preserve the hive conditions.
This is the inverse of the bijection κr introduced and exempliﬁed in the case r = 4 at the
end of section 2.

r

To proceed further, let UH(r)(λ, µ, ν) be the set of all triangular arrays of side length
r satisfying the hive triangle relations and the condition that all upright rhombus labels
are non-negative integers, with boundary edges labelled by λ, µ and ν. For each H ∈
UH(r)(λ, µ, ν) we deﬁne path addition operators χr, φk and ωr analogous to the path
removal operators χr, φr and ωr of section 7.
Deﬁnition 9.1. For any given H ∈ UH(r)(λ, µ, ν) with ℓ(λ) ≤ r we deﬁne three path
addition operators χr, φk and ωr whose action on H is to increase or reduce edge labels
by 1 along paths speciﬁed as follows:

(i) χr: the path consists of the boundary edges labelled νr and λr, with each of these

labels being increased by 1;

(ii) φk: for any k < r the path proceeds down the kth diagonal from the edge labelled
µk through upright rhombi of gradient 0 until it encounters an upright rhombus of
positive gradient, at which point it moves horizontally to the right into the (k + 1)th
diagonal and proceeds down this diagonal or to the right as before, and so on until
it either reaches the base of the hive and then moves to the right or reaches the
right hand boundary and then moves down the rth diagonal until, in both cases, it
terminates at the edge labelled λr, with all path α and γ edge labels being increased
by 1 and all path β edge labels decreased by 1 ;

(iii) ωr: the path proceeds directly down the rth diagonal until it terminates at the base

at the edge labelled λr, with all path edge labels increased by 1.

These three types of path addition are illustrated below. In each case every

bfblue edge label is increased by 1 and every red edge label is decreased by 1. In the case
of χr and ωr the path additions are conﬁned to the rightmost rth diagonal. On the other
hand the path addition route ascribed to the action of φk with 1 ≤ k < r consists of a
sequence of ladders through upright rhombi of gradient 0 in each diagonal from the kth
to the rth, with the passage from each diagonal to the next taking place through a red

Each ladder (coloured blue) extends down its diagonal either from the top left hand
boundary or from an upright rhombus (coloured green) until it either reaches an upright
rhombus of positive gradient (coloured yellow) or the base of the triangular array. Thus,
the ladders starting on the left hand boundary lack a head rhombus, while those ending
at the base lack a foot rhombus. As shown in the above example of type (ii), ladders
may consist of a single blue edge.
In such a case the ladder is said to have length 0.
More generally, its length is the number of upright rhombi it crosses, that is to say the
number of its horizontal blue edges. The path addition is such that the gradient of the
foot rhombus is decreased by 1 from its initial positive value, while the gradient of the
head rhombus is increased by 1.

It might be noted here that there are two distinct manners in which type (ii) paths
may terminate. They are illustrated below, with the ﬁgures on the left and right applying
to cases in which the path addition reaches the base in the diagonal with j = r and j < r,
respectively.

Lemma 9.2. Let H be an array in UH(r)(λ, µ, ν) with ℓ(λ) ≤ r. Then an application
of the path addition operator to H produces another such array ˜H with boundary edge
labels as appropriate to each type of addition operator. More precisely,

if ˜H = χrH
if ˜H = φkH, with 1 ≤ k < r,
if ˜H = ωrH

then ˜H ∈ UH(r)((λ + ǫr), µ, (ν + ǫr));
then ˜H ∈ UH(r)((λ + ǫr), (µ + ǫk), ν);
then ˜H ∈ UH(r)((λ + ǫr), (µ + ǫr), ν).

Proof: As far as elementary triangles are concerned the path additions give rise to the
following possibilities.

It is clear that the triangle conditions are preserved in every case.

As far as upright rhombus gradients are concerned the only conﬁguration that gives

rise to a reduction in an upright rhombus gradient is that shown below:

+1

−1

> 0

U −→ U −1

(9.5)

This situation only occurs in case (ii) of (9.1), where the transition in the case of the
foot rhombi is from U to U − 1 with U > 0. Thus all upright rhombus gradients remain
non-negative after all possible path additions.

This ensures that ˜H belongs to UH(λ∗, µ∗, ν∗) for some boundary edge labels λ∗, µ∗, ν∗.
The fact that these boundary edge labels are as speciﬁed in the Lemma follows directly
from Deﬁnition 9.1 of the path addition operations.
(cid:3)

In the case of left- and right-leaning elementary rhombi the only conﬁgurations that

72

give rise to a reduction in a rhombus gradient are those shown below:

R −→ R−1

L −→ L−1

L −→ L−1

It is not immediately clear that L and R are always > 0 in these conﬁguration. In fact
this depends crucially on both the number of path additions of each type and the order
in which they are applied. However, we claim the validity of the following
Theorem 9.3. Let n be a positive integer and let λ, µ and ν be partitions such that
ℓ(λ) ≤ n and µ, ν ⊆ λ with |λ| = |µ| + |ν|. For each LR hive K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ) with
upright rhombus gradients Vij for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n let

1 H (0) ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) .

(9.8)

In such a case we write H = σ(n)K.
Proof:

It is convenient to set λ(r) = (λ1, λ2, . . . , λr) and ν(r) = (ν1, ν2, . . . , νr) for r =
1, 2, . . . , n and to remind ourselves of the notation already used in connection with K
whereby µ(r) = (µ(r)
k = µk − Vk,n − Vk,n−1 − · · · − Vk,r+1 for
k = 1, 2, . . . , r. Notice in particular that this means that the exponent of ωr in (9.7)
is just µ(r)
r . The notation also allows us to deﬁne K(r) ∈ H(r)(λ(r), ν(r), µ(r)) to be the
subhive of K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ) consisting of its leftmost r diagonals, for r = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Thus K(r) is essentially the complement of the truncated hive K (n−r) in K = K (n).

Our strategy is to proceed by induction with respect to r in showing that H (r) ∈

H(r)(λ(r), µ(r), ν(r)), where H (r) = θrκ−1

r H (r−1) with θr determined by K(r).

In the case r = 1 we have K(1) =

where in the ﬁnal step use has been made of the fact that µ(1)

as required.

To complete the induction argument, we need to show that for r ≥ 2 if H (r−1) =
θr−1κ−1
r H (r−1) with θr de-
termined by K(r) as in (9.7), then H (r) ∈ H(r)(λ(r), µ(r), ν(r)). Before showing that H (r)
constructed in this way is a hive, let us ﬁrst show that at least its boundary edge labels
are as required. To do this it is helpful to display K(r) and various intermediate states
between H (r−1) and H (r). These take the form:

upright rhombi of gradient 0 to H (r−1) and then applying all µ(r)
type (i) path addition
r
operators. Then H (r)
by applying Vkr type (ii) path addition
(ii)
operators successively in the order k = r − 1, . . . , 2, 1. For each k the Vkr added paths
increase the kth left hand boundary edge label from µ(r−1)
k , as a consequence of
the ﬁrst identity in (9.11). Moreover, each of the path additions extends as far as the
foot of the rth diagonal adding precisely 1 both to the rth lower boundary edge and to
one or other of the upright rhombus gradients in this diagonal. It follows from this that
˜U1r + ˜U2r + · · · + ˜Ur−1,r = V1r + V2r + · · · + Vr−1,r and that the rth lower boundary edge

It remains to determine whether or not H (r) satisﬁes all necessary hive rhombus con-
r , as deﬁned by (9.7), to H (r−1) the ﬁrst step associated with
ditions. In applying θrκ−1
the action of κ−1
is to add an rth diagonal in which each upright rhombus has gradient 0,
as shown below on the left. This is followed by the action of ωα
r as shown
below on the right, where each blue edge has its label increased by α: that is from 0 to α
in the case of sloping blue edges, from νk to νk + α in the case of the kth horizontal blue
edge counted from the top, with k = 1, 2, . . . , r − 1, and from 0 to α in the case of the
horizontal blue edge on the boundary.

The hive conditions on H (r−1) imply that αr−1 ≥ · · · ≥ α2 ≥ α1 ≥ 0, while those on K(r)
imply that α1 = µ(r−1)
r = α. It follows on the left that after the action of κ−1
the right-leaning rhombus crossing the (r − 1)th and rth diagonals at level j has gradient
Rj = αj − 0 ≥ 0 for j = 1, 2, . . . , r − 1, and the gradients of the left-leaning rhombi in the
rth diagonal are νk − νk+1 ≥ 0 for k = 1, 2, . . . , r − 1. Since the upright rhombus gradients
at level k in the rth diagonal are 0, all the hive conditions are satisﬁed. Similarly, on
the right after the action of ωα
r the right-leaning rhombus crossing the (r − 1)th and rth
diagonals at level j has gradient αj − α ≥ α1 − α ≥ 0 for j = 1, 2, . . . , r − 1. Since
the upright and left-leaning rhombus gradients in the rth diagonal are unchanged, it can
again be seen that after all the path additions on the right all the hive conditions are still
satisﬁed.

r

Turning next to the path additions that follow from the application of φk with k < r,
there are two distinct ways in which an addition path may enter a ladder, as illustrated
below in the case of a ladder of length at least 1. If the ladder has length 0, in either case,
it passes immediately to the next diagonal and creates no rhombus of the type listed in

On the left, a ladder starting on the left hand boundary in the kth diagonal has been
shown. It has been illustrated immediately after the completed action any one of the Vkr
path additions by φk, on the assumption that this leaves a ladder of length s ≥ 1 in the
kth diagonal. This action has the eﬀect of increasing the boundary edge label from µ(r−1)
to α ≤ µ(r−1)
k . This case is exactly analogous to that on the right of (9.12).
The hive conditions on H (r−1) imply that αs ≥ · · · ≥ α2 ≥ α1, while those on K(r) imply
that α1 = µ(r−1)
k ≥ α. It follows as before that all necessary right-leaning rhombus
gradients such as Rj remain ≥ 0, and that all hive conditions are preserved.

On the right, a typical interior ladder is shown lying in the dth diagonal. It has been
illustrated immediately after any one of the actions of φk. Prior to this action the edges
labelled α, α0 and α1 had labels α − 1, α0 − 1 and α1, respectively. For the addition path
to enter the dth diagonal by way of the red edge it is necessary that the yellow upright
rhombus has an initial gradient U = α1 − (α0 − 1) > 0. The initial hive conditions also
imply that both α0 − 1 ≥ α − 1 and αs ≥ · · · ≥ α2 ≥ α1. It follows that α1 ≥ α0 and
αs ≥ · · · ≥ α2 ≥ α1 ≥ α so that after the path addition the upright rhombus has gradient
U − 1 = α1 − α0 ≥ 0 and the jth the right-leaning rhombus has gradient Rj = αj − α ≥ 0
for j = 1, 2, . . . , s. Thus all rhombus gradients remain ≥ 0. Not only that, the red edge
has an initial label that must be positive since U > 0, so it remains non-negative after
the path addition, and all hive conditions are therefore satisﬁed. However it still remains
to consider the left-leaning rhombus at the top of the ladder. To this end consider the
following diagram with the edge and gradient labels speciﬁed before the path addition.

(9.14)

In this situation, by hypothesis, the yellow upright rhombus has gradient U = β −β′ =
α′′ − α′ > 0 and the white upright rhombus has gradient 0. Advantage has been taken

76

of the latter condition to equate two pairs of edge labels, one pair labelled α and the
other labelled β′′. The initial hive conditions also imply that α′ ≥ α and β′ ≥ β′′ from
which it follows that L = β − β′′ > 0 and R = α′′ − α > 0. After the path addition
the edge label β is reduced to β − 1 and the edge label α is increased to α + 1. All this
implies that the rhombus gradients U, L and R are reduced to U − 1, L − 1 and R − 1,
respectively, all of which remain ≥ 0. In addition the red edge label has been reduced
from β to β − 1 = U + β′ − 1 ≥ β′ which is necessarily non-negative by the initial hive
conditions. Thus yet again the hive conditions are preserved.

There is just one more concern that shows itself in the case of a type (iia) path
addition of the form illustrated on the right in (9.3), in which under the action of some
φk the path reaches the base of the hive in a diagonal j with k ≤ j < r and then proceeds
along this base to the right-hand corner. Our previous arguments are suﬃcient to see that,
after the addition of the type (iia) path, all hive rhombus gradient conditions are satisﬁed,
including the non-negativity of the upright rhombus gradient signiﬁed by U in (9.3), except
possibly the non-negativity of the gradient of the left-leaning rhombus of the penultimate
type indicated in (9.6) that appears in the bottom right hand corner of (9.3). All the
previous arguments about the preservation of hive conditions have been independent of
any positivity assumption about the gradient, L, of this left-leaning rhombus on the base
of the hive at its right-hand end. To meet the hive condition for this rhombus we require
that L = νr−1 −U ≥ 0 because at this stage, just before the application of χ νr
r , the bottom
two edges on the right-hand boundary have labels νr−1 and 0. Since the red edge labels
are weakly decreasing from left to right both before and after the path addition, all such
red edge labels will be non-negative if νr−1 − U ≥ 0. Thus the non-negativity of both L
and all red edge labels will be guaranteed after each type (iia) path addition if U ≤ νr−1.
However, since U increases steadily under these path additions from its initial value 0 to
its ﬁnal value ˜Ur−1,r, we need only ˜Ur−1,r ≤ νr−1 to ensure that the hive conditions are
satisﬁed at the conclusion of all type (ii) path additions.

We will actually need to ensure that a stronger condition is met. This is necessitated

by a consideration of the ﬁnal type (iii) path additions arising from the action of χ νr
r .

This simply adds νr to the labels of the two edges meeting at the lower rightmost
vertex of H (r), as illustrated below, where it has been convenient to denote ˜Ur−1,r by U.

As a result of this path addition the left-leaning rhombus at the foot of the rth diagonal
has its gradient Lr decreased from νr−1 − U to νr−1 − U − νr, which is non-negative if and

77

only if U ≤ νr−1−νr. Since this is stronger than our previous condition U ≤ νr−1, it follows
that all hive conditions will be satisﬁed by H (r) if it can be shown that ˜Ur−1,r ≤ νr−1 − νr.
To prove this we ﬁrst make the following observation regarding the addition of a

succession of type (ii) paths.
on H (r−1) let a hive path addition of type (ii)
Lemma 9.4. During the action of θrκ−1
r
follow a path P starting from the left-hand boundary at level k, then the next such path
addition follows a path P ′ lying weakly below the path P in each diagonal from the kth
to the rth.
Proof:
The path P is generated by the action of φk with k < r and consists of a
sequence of ladders in the diagonals p for p = k, k + 1, . . . , r. The deﬁnition (9.7) of θr is
such that the next path P ′ must then be generated by the action of some φk′ with k′ ≤ k.
It follows that as P ′ moves down and to the right it encounters P in some diagonal p with
p ≥ k. However it can only do so by intersecting that part of P consisting of a ladder in
that diagonal. Since the upright rhombi on the ladder all have gradient 0, the path P ′
then necessarily follows P to the foot of the ladder where it may either continue to follow
P into the next diagonal or separate from P by continuing down its own ladder in the pth
diagonal. This is illustrated below in a diagram intended to make it clear that P ′ always
remains weakly below P .

(9.16)

The interpretation of this is that the ﬁrst path P is the union of the blue and magenta
edges, while the second path P ′ is the union of the red and magenta edges. Working
from left to right the route of P ′ meets that of P at the site of a purple upright rhombus
of gradient 0. The paths P ′ and P then coincide as shown in the initial magenta section,
until it reaches a foot rhombus at which point P continues to the right. Meanwhile, if the
gradient of that yellow rhombus, which was necessarily positive, is reduced to 0 by the
addition of the path P , then P ′ continues further down the diagonal. The process then
continues with the divergent paths coming together again in another magenta section,
but always with P ′ weakly below P .
(cid:3)

Our next observation concerns the relationship between type (ii) path additions Pi
and Qi generated by θr and θr−1, respectively. Since θ1 does not generate any type (ii)
path additions it may be assumed that r ≥ 3.

78

Lemma 9.5. For r ≥ 3 let Pi for i = 1, 2, . . . , λr [resp. Qi for i = 1, 2 . . . , λr−1] be
the paths added by the operation lying in the ith position counted from the left in the
expression (9.7) for θr [resp. the corresponding expression for θr−1], that is to say the ith
position in the reverse order of action of the individual constituent operations χr, φk, ωr
in θr [resp. χr−1, φk, ωr−1 in θr−1], assuming that each power of an operator is expanded
as a product of the same operator occurring as many times as its exponent. We denote
the operator giving rise to this ith path addition by θr,i [resp. θr−1,i].

Then for each i such that νr−1 < i ≤ νr +Pr−1

type (ii) and the path Pi lies strictly above Qi.

j=1 Vj,r which
j=1 Vj,r−1 due to the non-negativity of the right leaning rhombus
gradient Rkr in K. Hence the path Q passes from the lth diagonal to the (r−1)th diagonal
leaving an upright rhombus of positive gradient immediately above it in each diagonal
from the (l + 1)th to the (r − 1)th, necessarily including the kth, as illustrated below.

To show that P = Pi lies strictly above Q = Qi it only remains to show that the positivity
condition on all the green rhombus gradients associated with the addition of Qi remains
valid up until the subsequent addition of Pi.

νr +Pr−1

This can be accomplished as follows. Consider ﬁrst the case i = m where m =
j=1 Vjr, that is the case in (9.7) corresponding to the ﬁrst type (ii) path addition
in the action of θr and thus the maximum value of i in (9.17). In this case P = Pm,
let the addition of Q = Qm leave a sequence of upright rhombus gradients Uum(d),d > 0
for d = l + 1, l + 2, . . . , r − 1 with um(d) specifying the level at which the path Qm
enters the dth diagonal, with um(d) strictly increasing as d increases. The addition of
the remaining (ii) paths Qi with i < m can only increase the value of each Uum(d),d
since, thanks to Lemma 9.4, each Qi with i < m lies weakly below Qm. The remaining
operations between the addition of Qm and the addition of Pm leave all upright rhombus
gradients unaltered. Thus immediately prior to the addition of Pm we have Uum(d),d > 0
for all d = k, k + 1, . . . , r − 1 so that Pm cannot pass down through any of these upright
rhombi and must therefore lie stricty above Qm as claimed.

Then, in the case i = m − 1 if we set P = Pm−1 and Q = Qm−1 the addition of Qm
and Qm−1 leaves Uum(d),d > 0 and Uum−1(d),d > 0 if um−1(d) < um(d) and Uum−1(d),d > 1 if
um−1(d) = um(d) for d = l + 1, l + 2, . . . , r − 1, with um−1(d) also strictly increasing as d
increases. All of these gradients are left unaltered by the addition of the remaining (ii)
paths Qi with i < m − 1, and the remaining operations between the addition of Qm−1
and the addition of Pm. For any d > k the addition of Pm can only reduce Uum(d),d by 1
leaving Uum−1(d),d > 0 in both cases described above. It follows that Pm−1 which starts at
a level above Qm−1 remains strictly above Qm−1 for all d up to r − 1.

Continuing in the same way, one ﬁnds that Pi lies strictly above Qi for all i from
(cid:3)

j=1 Vjr, as claimed.

νr−1 + 1 to m = νr +Pr−1

We are now in a position to prove the following

Lemma 9.6. For r ≥ 2 let the action of θrκ−1
r−1H (r−2) yield H (r)
r
with the upright rhombus gradient in the position (r −1, r) given by ˜Ur−1,r. Then ˜Ur−1,r ≤
νr−1 − νr.

on H (r−1) = θr−1κ−1

80

Proof:
For r = 2 there are precisely V12 type (ii) path additions and each of these
contributes +1 to ˜U12. There are no other contributions so that ˜U12 = V12. However, in
K(2) the right-leaning rhombus hive condition R12 ≥ 0 implies that V12 ≤ ν1 − ν2, thereby
establishing the required result in the case r = 2.

For r ≥ 3 we can exploit Lemma 9.5. Given any pair of addition paths Pi and Qi
with Qi necessarily extending as far as the (r − 1)th diagonal, the fact that Pi lies strictly
above Qi means that Pi enters the rth diagonal above its lowest upright rhombus, and
therefore makes no contribution to ˜Ur−1,r. The only possible contributions to ˜Ur−1,r are
those that might arise from the type (ii) path additions Pi that are not paired with a
corresponding type (ii) path addition Qi. It then follows immediately from the alignment
of the expansions of θr and θr−1 in (9.17) that ˜Ur−1,r ≤ νr−1 − νr, as required.
(cid:3)

Returning to the proof of Theorem 9.3 that was interrupted immediately before we
embarked on Lemmas 9.4–9.6, we now know that ˜Ur−1,r ≤ νr−1 − νr, as required to
prove that all hive conditions are satisﬁed under the successive addition of all paths as
r on the hive H (r−1). Under the induction hypothesis that
dictated by the action of θrκ−1
H (r−1) ∈ H(r)(λ(r−1), µ(r−1), ν(r−1)), we have therefore established that H (r) = θrκ−1
r H (r−1)
is a hive. Since we have already established that H (r) has the appropriate boundary edge
labels, it follows that H (r) ∈ H(r)(λ(r), µ(r), ν(r)).

This completes the induction argument, and applying this result in the case r = n
we conclude that H = H (n) ∈ H(n)(λ(n), µ(n), ν(n)) = H(n)(λ, µ, ν), as claimed in (9.8),
thereby proving the validity of Theorem 9.3.
(cid:3)

10 Hive proofs of the bijective and involutive prop-

erties

The relationship between our path removal and path addition operations allows us to
establish the bijective nature of the maps we have encountered in Theorems 8.4 and 9.3
whose domains we can combine as follows:
Deﬁnition 10.1. For ﬁxed positive integer n, let H(n) be the union of all H(n)(λ, µ, ν) for
partitions λ, µ and ν with ℓ(λ) ≤ n and µ, ν ⊆ λ with |λ| = |µ|+|ν|. Let σ(n) : H(n) → H(n)
be such that for each H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) we have σ(n) : H 7→ K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ) with
K = σ(n)H, as deﬁned in Theorem 8.4. Similarly, let σ(n) : H(n) → H(n) be such that for
each K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ) we have σ(n) : K 7→ H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) with H = σ(n)K, as deﬁned
in Theorem 9.3.

With this deﬁnition we have the following:

Theorem 10.2. The maps σ(n) and σ(n) are mutually inverse bijections.
Proof: It follows from Theorems 8.4 and 9.3 that the maps σ(n) and σ(n) provide maps
from H(n)(λ, µ, ν) to H(n)(λ, ν, µ) and from H(n)(λ, ν, µ) to H(n)(λ, µ, ν), respectively.
Moreover, for any H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) if σ(n)H = K with K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ), then K records
the boundary edges of a sequence of path removals that reduce H to the empty hive H (0).

81

If K is then used to specify the sequence of path additions that create σ(n)K from H (0),
then this latter sequence is exactly the reverse of the original sequence with each path
removal replaced by its inverse in the form of a path addition. The sequence formed
in this way is precisely what is required to re-create H from H (0). That is to say, if
σ(n)H = K then σ(n)K = H. By exactly the same type of argument, if one starts with
K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ) and creates H = σ(n)K ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν), then the action of σ(n) on H
consists of reversing the order of the path additions and applying their inverses to H in
the form of corresponding path removals. By this means one necessarily arrives back at
K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ) as a record of the boundary edges of the sequence of path removals.
That is to say, this time, if H = σ(n)K then K = σ(n)H. It follows that σ(n) and σ(n) are
mutually inverse maps and that both are bijective.
(cid:3)

Our next task is to prove that the map σ(n) is an involution. To do this we proceed
by way of a sequence of Lemmas, in connection with which we need to introduce a new
type (iv) path removal operation.
Deﬁnition 10.3. Given any hive H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) with λn > 0 and Uin > 0 for some
i < n, the type (iv) path removal operator ψn acts on H by decreasing the red edge
labels by 1 along a zig-zag path from the edge labelled λn to that labelled νk where
k = min{j | Ujn > 0} as illustrated below. For convenience we have set βk,n−1 = β∗ and
Ukn = U ∗ with U ∗ > 0 by the deﬁnition of k,

µn

(10.1)

Prior to the path removal the hive conditions, together with the fact that U ∗ > 0,
β∗ ≥ 0, µn ≥ 0 and λn > 0, imply that all the red edge labels are positive. This can be
seen by noting that the red α-edges have labels ≥ µn + U ∗ > 0, the red β-edge has label
νk = β∗ + U ∗ > 0, and the red γ-edges have labels ≥ λn > 0. It follows that after the type
(iv) path removal these and all other edge labels remain non-negative. In addition the
type (iv) path removal preserves the hive triangle conditions and decreases the bounday
edge labels λn and νk by one, and the upright rhombus gradient Ukn = U ∗ also by one,
whilst preserving the values of all other upright rhombus gradients. That such a path

82

removal preserves all the rhombus hive conditions can be seen from the following diagrams

As an immediate consequence of this we have:

Lemma 10.4. Let H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) with ℓ(λ) = n be such that Uin > 0 for some i < n.
Then ψnH ∈ H(n)(λ − ǫn, µ, ν − ǫk) where k = min{j | Ujn > 0}.

We are now in a position to state what turns out to be a crucial lemma en route to

Lemma 10.7 and our involution Theorem 10.8.
Lemma 10.5. Let H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) with ℓ(λ) = n be such that Uin > 0 for some i < n.
Then σ(n)ψn H = φn σ(n)H, that is to say that the following diagram commutes:

and let ˆH = ψn H. Setting H (n) = H and ˆH (n) = ˆH, let the action of σ(n) yield K = K (n)
and ˆK = ˆK (n) by way of the chains

θn to H and θn to ˆH := ψn H. These procedures diﬀer only in respect of the existence of
one extra path removal from H, namely the last type (ii) path removal. Typically, this
last type (ii) path removal is illustrated in magenta and blue in (10.5) below on the left:

This has been drawn on the assumption that there exists l < k such that Ul,n−1 = Y with
Y > 0 before the removal of the blue path. For simplicity, we refer to this as the Y > 0
situation. If there is no upright rhombus gradient Ul,n−1 = Y with l < k and Y > 0,
which we refer to as the Y = 0 situation, then the blue path removal extends the whole
way up the (n − 1)th diagonal to the left-hand boundary at level j = n − 1.

All but the last of the type (ii) path removals from H coincide with those from ˆH
and reduce all the upright rhombus gradients in the nth diagonal to 0 except for that of
Ukn in H which at this stage takes the value 1. This gradient is then reduced to 0 by the
ﬁnal type (ii) path removal from H, represented above by the magenta and blue path.
This goes up the magenta ladder from its horizontal base to its head rhombus, coloured
purple, at level k (counted from the top) and then enters the (n − 1)th diagonal and
passes along the blue path to the left-hand boundary at some level j (counted from the
bottom) with j ≤ n − 1.

Following this, the ﬁnal µn type (iii) path removals that arise if µn > 0 are necessarily
the same for both H and ˆH.
It follows that H (n−1) diﬀers from ˆH (n−1) only through
diﬀerences of ±1 as appropriate in the labels of the blue edges, together with associated
diﬀerences of ±1 in the gradients of the foot and head rhombi of the blue ladders in the
diagonals from n − 1 down to j. To be precise, in the case of the above example (10.5),
if in the (n − 1)th diagonal two upright rhombus gradients at levels k and l separated by
0’s take values X ≥ 0 and Y ≥ 1 in ˆH (n−1), then they take the values X + 1 and Y − 1
in H (n−1), with further diﬀerences of ±1 in the foot and head rhombus gradients in four
more diagonals.
If we are in the Y = 0 situation then the blue path zig-zags up the
(n − 1)th diagonal in the form of a type (iii) path leaving an upright rhombus gradient of

84

X + 1 in H (n−1) and decreasing the top-most edge label by 1.

Furthermore, if the blue path reaches the left-hand boundary at level j ≤ n − 1
(counted from the bottom), then the path removals discussed so far create identical entries
Vin ≥ 0 in both K (1) and ˆK (1) for all i < j, together with Vjn = V + 1 in K (1) and
Vjn = V in ˆK (1), respectively, for some V ≥ 0, as illustrated in (10.5) on the right.
It can then be seen from this diagram that the removal of the brown path from K (1)
gives φn K (1) = ˆK (1) since the eﬀect of this removal is to reduce the lowest non-vanishing
upright rhombus gradient V + 1 to V . This proves the validity of (10.4) in the case r = 1.

Next we consider the removal of paths in ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1) through the action of
θn−1. There are two cases to consider: Case (i), in which all type (ii) paths removed from
ˆH (n−1) that enter the (n − 2)th diagonal at or below level k pass west and northwest to
the hive boundary without ever becoming coincident (in the sense of having an edge in
common) with the blue path; and Case (ii) in which at least one such path removed from
ˆH (n−1) does become coincident with the blue path. 1ex
Case (i) Consider ﬁrst all paths removed from ˆH (n−1) that enter the (n − 2)th diagonal
at or below level k to leave a hive ˆH ′. The eﬀect of their removal is to reduce the upright
rhombus gradient Uk,n−1 in ˆH (n−1) from X to 0 in ˆH ′. By hypothesis none of these paths
becomes coincident with the blue path. They pass to the left-hand boundary at level
i < j along paths determined by the upright rhombus gradients below the blue path,
with the foot rhombus gradients responsible for an inpenetrable barrier to climbing the
blue ladders. Exactly the same paths may be removed from H (n−1) since the upright
rhombus gradients below the blue path in H (n−1) and ˆH (n−1) diﬀer only through the
foot rhombi of the blue ladders having a gradient 1 greater than those in ˆH (n−1), as
signiﬁed by the symbols +1 in each such foot rhombus as shown on the left in (10.5).
They thereby present exactly the same inpenetrable barrier as before, leaving the paths
themselves unaltered. Removing these paths from H (n−1) to give a hive H ′ reduces the
upright rhombus gradient Uk,n−1 in H (n−1) from X + 1 to 1 in H ′. In this situation with
the upright rhombus gradient 1 in H ′ and 0 in ˆH ′, we say that the rhombus itself is
pre-critical. This is signiﬁed in (10.6) below by placing the symbols 0 above 1 in such an
upright rhombus.

In the case of path removals from H ′, this leaves a single extra type (ii) path P
entering the (n − 2)th diagonal at level k, as shown in magenta and red on the left in
(10.6). Before its removal, the diﬀerence of +1 in the gradients of the foot rhombi of H ′
as compared with those of ˆH ′, ensures that they remain positive. It follows that the extra
path P stays strictly below the blue path and ends on the left hand boundary at level i
with i < j.

The next path removal from ˆH (n−1) has also been illustrated on the left on the as-
sumption that we are in the Y > 0 situation. It takes the form of a type (ii) path ˆP and
proceeds up the (n − 1)th diagonal, following ﬁrst the magenta path and then the black
edge at level k across what is now the critical rhombus in the (n−1)th diagonal. After this
it necessarily follows the blue path that formed the only diﬀerence between ˆH (n−1) and
H (n−1). Thus the critical rhombus has produced a bifurcation of the magenta path into
the blue and red paths followed by ˆP and P , respectively. Thereafter the rhombus has
gradient 0 in both cases and is said to be post-critical. All the remaining pairs of paths
removed from ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1) coincide, each passing directly through the post-critical
rhombus.

On the other hand if we are in the Y = 0 situation, the blue path that formed the
only diﬀerence between ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1) would have proceeded directly up the (n − 1)th
diagonal to its top-most edge, with no diﬀerence between the upright rhombus gradients
of ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1) in this diagonal above level k, or indeed any other diagonal at any
level. It follows that all the remaining type (ii) path removals from ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1)
coincide. This leaves just type (iii) path removals from ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1), all following
the same path directly up the (n − 1)th diagonal, but with one more type (iii) path
removal required for ˆH (n−1) than for H (n−1). This extra path removal, like all the others
of type (iii), must also follow the blue path terminating at level j = n − 1, bringing the
edge labels along this path into coincidence for both ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1).

To conclude, for both Y = 0 and Y > 0 all the path removals from H (n−1) and ˆH (n−1)
coincide other than the magenta and red path removed from H (n−1) and the magenta,
black and blue path removed from ˆH (n−1). Since the blue part was already absent in
H (n−1) by virtue of its removal from H (n) it follows that ˆH (n−2) diﬀers from H (n−2) only
through diﬀerences of ±1 as appropriate in the labels of the red edges, together with
associated diﬀerences of ±1 in the gradients of the foot and head rhombi of the red
ladders in the diagonals from n − 2 down to i.

It also follows that if the numbers of paths reaching i and j in passing from H (n−1) to

86

H (n−2) are A and B, respectively, then the corresponding numbers for the passage from
ˆH (n−1) to ˆH (n−2) are A − 1 and B + 1, respectively, with A ≥ 1 and B ≥ 0. There are
no paths in either case reaching levels between i and j. The consequence for this for the
upright rhombus gradients of K (2) and ˆK (2) is illustrated on the right in (10.6), where the
entries A, B and V + 1 apply to K (2) and A − 1, B + 1 and V apply to ˆK (2). If we clarify
this by separating the diagrams of K (2) and ˆK (2) we ﬁnd that they are related by a single
path removal as shown below in (10.7).

It follows from the above argument that φn K (2) = ˆK (2) for all Case (i) examples, thereby
establishing for Case (i) the validity of (10.4) in the case r = 2.

Case (ii) By hypothesis, in this case there exists at least one type (ii) path removed
from ˆH (n−1) that enters the (n − 2)th diagonal at level k or below and becomes coincident
with the blue path that diﬀerentiates between ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1). This cannot occur, of
course, if this blue path is conﬁned, as in the Y = 0 situation, to the (n − 1)th diagonal.
Thus in Case (ii) we must be in the Y > 0 situation.

We then proceed as before by considering pairs of path removals generated by the
action of θn−1 on ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1). Let the sequence of pairs of type (ii) paths generated
in this way be denoted by ˆPa and Pa for ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1), respectively, with a =
1, 2, . . . , m. Here m is the sum of upright rhombus gradients in the (n − 1)th diagonal,
which is the same for both ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1). As we work up the diagram, the two paths
ˆPa and Pa, in ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1) respectively, are identical so long as the path ˆPa stays
below the route of the blue path, due to the same reason as in Case (i). However, by
virtue of our Case (ii) hypothesis, at least one of the paths ˆPa that enter the (n − 2)th
diagonal at or below level k, that is to say below the blue path, becomes coincident with
the blue path somewhere to its west. Let ˆPc be the ﬁrst such path. We shall now see
that this is a case of bifurcation between the paths ˆPc and Pc upon encountering a critical
rhombus.

Due to the form taken by type (ii) paths passing continuously from one diagonal to
another after climbing a ladder in each diagonal, the coincidence of ˆPc with the blue path

87

necessarily starts with the path ˆPc entering the blue ladder in, say, the pth diagonal,
traversing its foot rhombus at, say, level f , from its lower right edge, via its horizontal
In the picture (10.8)below, the part of ˆPc up to this foot
edge to its upper left edge.
rhombus is shown in dotted magenta, and the horizontal edge of this rhombus in black.
In order for this to happen, this rhombus must have gradient 0 in this situation. On the
other hand, the path Pc, initially coincident with ˆPc along the dotted magenta path, ﬁnds
that the gradient of the same foot rhombus equal to 1 instead of 0, a diﬀerence arising
from the blue path distinguishing H (n−1) from ˆH (n−1), and the path Pc therefore passes
west below this rhombus. The situation is marked in (10.8),as in Case (i), by placing the
symbols 0 above 1 in this rhombus, showing its gradients before the removals of ˆPc and
Pc respectively. When reached by the common dotted magenta part of the paths ˆPc and
Pc, it causes a bifurcation, so this rhombus should duly be called critical at this point.
Note that this rhombus will carry a common gradient 0 after this pair of removal, and we
shall then call it post-critical as in Case (i).

To follow the bifurcated paths beyond the critical rhombus, the path ˆPc necessarily
follows the route of the original blue path to its end at level j, since the upright rhombus
gradients guiding this route, namely those in the original blue ladders except for their
foot rhombi, have the same values as they did immediately before the removal of the
original blue path during the application of the operator θn to H (n), which was missing
in the application of θn to ˆH (n). This part of the original blue path is shown in dotted
blue in (10.8). The path Pc, on the other hand, after decreasing the gradient of the
critical rhombus from 1 to 0, proceeds along what is exempliﬁed as the red path in (108),
to end on the left-hand boundary at some level i with i < j, for the same reason as in
Case (i) regarding an inpenetrable barrier below the original blue path.

Let ˆH and H be the hives obtained from ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1), respectively, at this stage.
The only edges of ˆH and H that have diﬀerent labels constitute what we call a line of
diﬀerence. Working from right to left, this consists of the undotted blue edges, the single
black edge and the red edges, each of whose edge labels diﬀers by ±1 as between ˆH and
H. For future reference the black edge label in ˆH is one greater than that in H.
In
general there remain further path removals from both ˆH and H under the action of θn−1.

88

With an additional assumption on the subsequent pairs of paths generated by the
action of θn−1 that none of them encounter any critical rhombi except in the starting
(n − 1)th diagonal, such a pair of path removals from both ˆH and H emanating from
levels at or below k must proceed together weakly above the dotted magenta path and
strictly below the blue path until they enter the pth diagonal at a level below (that is
geometrically below) level f . Thereafter they follow the dotted magenta path up the
pth diagonal, passing inexorably through the post-critical rhombus since its gradient is 0
in both ˆH and H. They then proceed west or northwest weakly above the dotted blue
path, eventually terminating on the left-hand boundary at level j or above. Since, by
crossing the line of diﬀerence at the post-critical rhombus they do not disturb it, these
path removals from ˆH and H necessarily coincide, and they still leave the black edge
having labels that diﬀer by 1 for ˆH and H.

However, because of the distinction between the upright rhombus gradients X + 1 and
Y −1 in the (n−1)th diagonal of H (n−1) at levels k and l, and the corresponding gradients
X and Y in ˆH (n−1), the next pair of paths Pd and ˆPd removed from H (n−1) and ˆH (n−1),
respectively, are no longer coincident. As illustrated below in (10.9), they are initially
coincident along a magenta section in the (n − 1)th diagonal, until they both meet the
pre-critical rhombus at level k. Here they diverge, with Pd following a red path strictly
below the original blue path as far as the post-critical rhombus in the pth diagonal at
level q, with ˆPd crossing the critical rhombus in its (n−1)th diagonal by means of its black
horizontal edge, and then following the dotted blue path, coincident with a portion of
the original blue path, as far once again as the post-critical rhombus in the pth diagonal
at level q. At that point the path Pd crosses this post-critical rhombus along what had
been in (10.8) its black horizontal edge and merges with the path ˆPd, with both then
proceeding along a magenta path to the left-hand boundary at some level j′ ≥ j.

Now let ˆH ′ and H ′ be the hives obtained from ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1), respectively, at
this stage. As far as the two critical rhombi are concerned in diagonals n − 1 and p,
the gradients are now all 0 in both ˆH ′ and H ′. The fact that ˆPd, but not Pd, passes
along the horizontal edge of the critical rhombus in the (n − 1)th diagonal changes the

89

edge label in ˆH ′ so that it is one lower than that in H. It is therefore coloured black in
(10.9) to signify that it is now to be incorporated in the line of diﬀerence between ˆH ′ and
H ′. In contrast to this, the fact that Pd, but not ˆPd, passes along the horizontal edge of
the critical rhombus in the pth diagonal of H lowers its edge label by 1, bringing it into
coincidence with that of ˆH ′ and thereby removing this edge from the line of diﬀerence
between ˆH ′ and H ′. This new line of diﬀerence thus consists of the single blue and black
edges in (10.9), together with the red edges.

Continuing to remove the remaining Y − 1 paths neceassary to reduce to 0 the upright
rhombus gradient at level l in diagonal n − 1, has no eﬀect on this line of diﬀerence
since the paths are coincident in ˆH ′ and H ′, as indeed are all subsequent path removals
generated by the action of θn−1, including those of type (iii). All such paths pass up the
(n−1)th diagonal to level l, crossing the line of diﬀerence without disturbing it in any way
at level k, before proceeding either west and northwest or just northwest to the left-hand
hive boundary at or above level j′.

As in Case (i) this leave H (n−2) and ˆH (n−2) diﬀering by a single path removal, namely
that speciﬁed this time by the red part of the line of diﬀerence that lies within these two
(n − 2)-hives, with K (2) and ˆK (2) diﬀering exactly as before by the single brown path
removal illustrated in (10.7). This conﬁrms the validity of ˆK (2) = ψn K (2) in all Case (ii)
examples for which there is just one interior critical rhombus in addition to the critical
rhombus on the right-hand boundary.

However, there exist other Case (ii) examples involving more than one internal critical
rhombus as will be exempliﬁed next. The elucidation of paths proceeds as before. There
may exist an initial sequence of pairs of paths common to ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1) that pass
to the left-hand boundary without meeting the original blue path responsible for the
distinction between these two hives. Then by hypothesis there exists a pair of paths Pc
and ˆPc that follow a dotted magenta path along a common route in ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1)
until this reaches the ﬁrst critical rhombus in the pth diagonal. Here it bifurcates, with
ˆPc following the dotted blue path in ˆH (n−1) to the left-hand boundary at level j and Pc
following the red path in H (n−1) to the same boundary at level i. Thereby leaving the
following post-critical situation in which the pair of upright rhombus gradients have both
been shown to be 0.

After this there may be a sequence of pairs of path removals common to both ˆH (n−1)
and H (n−1) that proceed west and northwest strictly below the blue path and weakly
above the dotted magenta path until they intersect it in the pth diagonal. They then
follow it up this diagonal passing through the post-critical rhombus and then proceeding
west and northwest weakly above the dotted blue path terminating on the left-hand
boundary at level j or above.

Since there are now to be at least two interior critical rhombi, there exists a new pair
of path removals, say Pd and ˆPd that follow the dotted magenta path along a common
route in ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1) until they reach the critical rhombus in the qth diagonal.
Here they diverge making the rhombus post-critical, this time with Pd following the red
path in H (n−1) and ˆPd following the dotted blue path in ˆH (n−1) that is coincident with
the original blue path. Beyond the qth diagonal the red part of the path Pd eventually
reaches the pth diagonal which it necessarily ascends as far as the post-critical rhombus
which it then crosses, only to merge with the dotted blue part of the path ˆPd to follow a
second dotted magenta path to the left-hand boundary weakly above all previous paths
to terminate at some level j′. This is illustrated below, with the omission of the dotted
paths from (10.10).

Now we are in a position analogous to that illustrated in (10.8).

In general there
will be a further sequence of pairs of path removals common to both ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1)
that proceed from the foot of the (n − 1)th diagonal west and northwest, weakly above
the dotted magenta path and strictly below the blue path in (10.11). At some point
they must reach the qth diagonal, and then follow it up as far as the second post-critical
rhombus. They pass through this, without disturbing the line of diﬀerences, and proceed
west and northwest weakly above both the blue and magenta dotted paths terminating
on the left-hand boundary. Provided no more than two internal critical rhombi occur this
sequence of common path removals may be continued until the upright rhombus at level
k in the (n − 1)th diagonal has become critical with its gradient reduced to 1 and 0 in the
cases ˆH (n−1) and H (n−1), respectively. At this stage, illustrated below in (10.12), the line
of diﬀerence consists of the single blue and black edges, together with the continuous

91

red path.

The next pair of path removals are the last of the X + 1 path removals from H (n−1)
to enter diagonal (n − 2) at level k and the ﬁrst of the Y path removals from ˆH (n−1) to
enter diagonal (n − 2) at level l, These are illustrated below in (10.12) in which the dotted
sections of paths in (10.11) have been omitted.

Let the corresponding pair of paths be Pe and ˆPe. Then Pe traces the same type of
path as its predecessors, west and northwest along a red path to the qth diagonal, across
the critical rhombus decreasing its black edge label in (10.11) by 1, thereby removing
it from the line of diﬀerence, and then proceeding west and northwest to the left-hand
boundary. Path ˆPe follows the undotted blue path in (10.11), removing it from the line of
diﬀerence and converting it to the dotted blue path. In doing so it meets the qth diagonal
and thereafter it necessarily merges with Pe, as represented in (10.12) by another dotted
magenta portion.

If we remove from (10.12) all dotted edges this exposes more clearly the ﬁnal line of
diﬀerence, which appears as a red path extending from the (n − 1)th diagonal at level k
to the left-hand boundary at level i.

As in Case (i) this leaves H (n−2) and ˆH (n−2) diﬀering by a single path removal, the red
path, with K (2) and ˆK (2) diﬀering exactly as before by the single brown path removal
illustrated in (10.7). Thus once again we have ˆK (2) = φn K (2).

It is clear that this argument may be extended to the case of an arbitrary number of
internal critical rhombi, through the insertion of additional pairs of paths that initially
coincide, then bifurcate at some critical point before meeting at the next interior point to
the west or northwest, crossing the line of diﬀerence and thereafter merging and passing
to the left hand boundary, precisely as in (10.11). This still leaves ˆK (2) = φn K (2) in all
cases, conﬁrming the validity of (10.4) in the case r = 2.

To extend this argument to show that ˆK (r) = φn K (r) for r > 2 it should be noted
that, just as H (n−1) diﬀers from ˆH (n−1) only by the removal of a single blue path entering
the H (n−1) hive at level k and leaving at some level j that we may denote by h(n − 1) as
shown below in (10.14), so H (n−2) diﬀers from ˆH (n−2) only by the removal of a single red
path, again entering the H (n−2) hive at level k and leaving at some level i < j that we
may denote by h(n − 2).

h(n−2)

Iterating this process allows one to see that H (s) diﬀers from ˆH (s) only by the removal
of a single magenta path entering the s-hive region at level k and leaving at some level
h(s), again as shown above in (10.14). This continues until the case s = k, exempliﬁed
by the removal of the green path that distinguishes H (k) from ˆH (k).

Now we claim that H (k−1) = ˆH (k−1). Upon application of θk, the hive H (k) aﬀords
one extra type (i) path removal compared with ˆH (k), whereas ˆH (k) aﬀords one extra type
(ii) path removal compared with H (k), whose route coincides with the green path, with
its rightmost β edge, that is to say the edge that would initially have been labelled βkk,
replaced by the bottom γ edge labelled λk. Thus the pairs of path removals via θk,
applied to H (k) and ˆH (k), eliminate the diﬀerence shown by the green path, yielding
H (k−1) = ˆH (k−1). Hereafter it is obvious that the pairs of path removals coincide for both
hives all the way to the empty hive H (0) = ˆH (0).

All this is reﬂected in the partner hive arena. The algorithm leading from K (0) and

93

ˆK (0) to K (n) and ˆK (n) is such that the diagonals of these hives are built up one-by-one
by counting the path removals that reach the left-hand boundaries of H (s) and ˆH (s) at
each level for all s = n, n − 1, . . . , k. The ﬁrst step involves the path removals from H (n)
and ˆH (n). These only diﬀer by the removal of the single blue path illustrated in (10.5)
leaving H (n) at level j = h(n − 1) and thereby distinguising the entries V + 1 and V in
K (1) and ˆK (1), respectively, where these entries constitute the nth diagonal of K (n) and
ˆK (n), as shown below in (10.15).

The second step involves the path removals from H (n−1) and ˆH (n−1). These only diﬀer
by the removal of a single red path removed from H (n−1) and leaving at level i = h(n − 2)
and a single blue path removed from ˆH (n−1) and leaving at level j = h(n − 1) as shown
in (10.6). This latter path is coincident, as we have explained, with the blue path
previously removed from H (n). The corresponding gradients of rhombi in the (n − 1)th
diagonal of K (n) and ˆK (n) must then diﬀer by ±1. This, as we have seen in (10.7) is just
the condition necessary for the brown path removal from K (n) to pass continuously from
the nth diagonal to the (n − 1)th diagonal at level j = h(n − 1) between the two rhombi
whose gradients are changed by −1 and +1 in creating ˆK (n) in accordance with the result
φn K (2) = ˆK (2).

At the next stage with the red path is now interpreted as the extra path removed from
ˆH (n−2) and there will be an extra path, not shown, removed from H (n−2). The fact that
the red path serves a dual role means that the brown path removal from K (n) to give
ˆK (n) extends in a continuous manner between the −1 and +1 appearing on the (n − 1)th
and (n − 2)th diagonals at level i = h(n − 2) as shown below in (10.15).

A similar match occurs in connection with the magenta path removal from H (s) and
ˆH (s−1). Proceeding in this way for s = n − 2, n − 3, . . . , k as far as the green path, and
taking into account the coincidence of all upright rhombus gradients to be written in the
(k − 1)th, (k − 2)th, . . . and 2nd diagonals of K and ˆK,

one arrives at the required result φn K (n) = ˆK (n), necessary to complete the proof of
(cid:3)

Lemma 10.6.

We may now exploit Lemma 10.5 in the proof of the following:

Lemma 10.7. Let H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) be such that ℓ(λ) = n then

(σ(n))2 θn H = θn (σ(n))2 H .

(10.16)

Proof: First let K = σ(n) H and L = σ(n) K so that by construction K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ)
and L ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν). Then consider the following diagram:

σ(n)

Just as θn = ωµn

n maps H and L to ˜H and ˜L, respectively, as in Theo-
χνn
rem 7.6, let ηn be the operator mapping K to K †, that is ηn = χµn
n . The
type (iii) action of ωνn
n on K reduces by νn each of the edge labels along a zig-zag down
the nth diagonal with the top and bottom edge labels reduced from νn and λn to 0 and
λn − νn, respectively. The type (ii) action of ψλn−µn−νn
then reduces to 0 all upright
rhombus gradients in the nth diagonal, as well as reducing the bottom edge label from
λn − νn to µn whilst reducing the right hand boundary edges from µ = µ(n) to (µ(n−1), µn).
Finally, the type (i) action of χµn
n reduces the two boundary edge labels of the triangle at
the foot of the nth diagonal from µn to 0. Thus in the left hand rectangle of the above
diagram ηn empties the nth diagonal of K, just as θn empties the nth diagonal of H.

n ψλn−µn−νn

n

ωνn

n

Since the only diﬀerence between K † = σ(n)θn H and K = σ(n) H is a failure to insert
the appropriate edge labels and upright rhombus gradients in the nth diagonal of K †, and
the action of ηn in mapping K to K † reduces all these to 0, it follows that the left hand
rectangle of the diagram (10.17) is commutative.

Turning to the upper right hand rectangle, this too is commutative since the action of
χνn
n in reducing the edge labels λn and νn of K to λn − νn and 0, respectively, corresponds
exactly to the action of ωνn
n in reducing the edge labels λn and νn of the partner hive L
to λn − νn and 0, respectively. A similar result applies to the lower right hand rectangle,
and crucially, the central rectangles on the right is also commutative by virtue of the
application of Lemma 10.5 applied λn − µn − νn times.

Thus the following diagram is commutative:

(10.18)

This implies the validity of (10.16) as required to complete the proof.

(cid:3)

As a consequence of this we have

Theorem 10.8. For all n ∈ N and all n-hives H we have

(σ(n))2 H = H .

(10.19)

Proof: We proceed by induction with respect to n. First it should be noted that in the
case n = 1 we have

so that (σ(1))2 H = H for all 1-hives H.

Here, it should be recalled that κn is a bijection between n-hives whose nth diagonals
are empty and (n − 1)-hives. Thanks to the action of θn, ηn and θn, respectively, the
nth diagonals of ˜H, K † and ˜L are all empty, so that κn can act on them legitimately. It
simply deletes their nth diagonals, with its inverse κ−1
n merely restoring them. It follows
once again that this whole diagram is commutative.

By the induction hypothesis, we now assume that (σ(n−1))2 H ∗ = H ∗. That is to say

96

L∗ = H ∗, and we have the following simpliﬁed commutative diagram

Thus the hives H and L, which are both in H(n)(λ, µ, ν) are transformed under the
action of κnθn into the same hive H ∗ ∈ H(n−1)(λ∗, µ#, ν∗) for some µ#, with λ∗ = λ−λnǫn,
ν∗ = ν − νnǫn.

L ), respectively. By construction both K (1)

Now we consider the action of Θn on (H, K (0)) and (L, K (0)) to give (H ∗, K (1)

H ) and
(L∗, K (1)
L must have lower and upper
edge labels λn and νn, outer right-hand boundary edge labels µ, as determined by the
n-truncated n-hive K (0), and inner left-hand boundary edge labels µ#, as determined by
the left-hand boundary edge labels of H ∗ = L∗. These boundary edge labels are suﬃcient
to determine an (n − 1)-truncated n-hive completely. It follows that K (1)
L . Thus
both components of Θn(H, K (0)) and Θn(L, K (0)) coincide.

H and K (1)

H = K (1)

We know that H and L can be recovered from Θn(H, K (0)) and Θn(L, K (0)), respec-
tively, through applications of the path addition operator θn to the (n − 1)-hives consti-
tuting their left-hand components, making use of the upright rhombus gradients in the
(n − 1)-truncated n-hives constituting their right-hand components. Hence the equality
Θn(H, K (0)) = Θn(L, K (0)) implies that H = L. That is to say H = L = (σ(n))2H,
thereby completing the induction argument and ensuring the validity of (10.19) for all
n-hives.
(cid:3)

11 Observations on the centrality of upright rhombus

gradients

Here we brieﬂy mention some ideas that come to mind in reviewing the structure of the
hive path removal procedure. In deﬁning the operator θr = ωµr
r as in (7.15),
its action on H (r) is such that the operators χr and ωr not only mutually commute, but
also commute with each operator φr. In fact the actions of χr or ωr do not change any
upright rhombus gradients, causing no change in the way each operator φr, driven solely
by the upright rhombus gradients, ﬁnds its path, modiﬁes such gradients and arrives at
its terminating row number.

r φλr−µr−νr

χνr

r

This leads to the idea of considering what we call a U-system U (r) consisting only of a
triangular array of non-negative upright rhombus gradients {Uij}1≤i<j≤r, representing all
r-hives having the same upright rhombus gradients {Uij}1≤i<j≤r with all possible boundary
edge labels µ, ν and λ, on which the action of the operator φr is well deﬁned, yielding a
new U-system U ′(r) = {U ′

ij}1≤i<j≤r and a terminating row number k.

97

Before looking at this action, given any triangular array {Uij}1≤i<j≤n of non-negative
integers, it is of interest to know whether a corresponding U-system U (n) exists, that is
to say if there exist boundary edge labels µ, ν and λ that satisfy the criteria laid down in
(2.17).These constraints take the form

Along with the fact that Ujk > 0 for 1 ≤ j < k ≤ n this conﬁrms that in this case all
three sets of hive rhombus conditions (2.17) are satisﬁed.

It is straightforward to map the corresponding hive H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) to an LR-tableau
T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) under the bijection described in Section 2.3. In the case n = 5 this yields

It is clear that the semistandardness and lattice permutation requirements of Deﬁnition 2.2
are rather trivially satisﬁed by virtue of the distribution of the various blocks of identical
entries. In particular the widths of the cyan blocks are just what are required to ensure
the satisfaction of the lattice permutation property without introducing any max or min
operators.

The action of θr on U (r) can be deﬁned to be that of φUr−1,r+···+U1r

r

with 1 ≤ i < r to zero. Setting U ′′(r) = {U ′′
action of κr on U ′′(r) to be to shave oﬀ the components U ′′
zero, yields a smaller U-system consisting of the triangular array U ′′(r−1) = {U ′′

which reduces all Uir
ij}1≤i<j≤r = θrU (r), and further deﬁning the
ir with 1 ≤ i < r which are already
ij}1≤i<j≤r−1.
Then applying κ2θ2κ3θ3 · · · κnθn to U (n) = {Uij}1≤i<j≤n and, while applying each θr,
recording the numbers Vkr for 1 ≤ k < r ≤ n, of occurrences of k as terminating row
numbers gives an involutive map σ(n) from the U-system U (n) = {Uij}1≤i<j≤n to another
U-system V (n) = {Vkr}1≤k<r≤n.

This is illustrated by eliminating the boundary edge labels throughout our Example 8.3
and restricting the operations to be those of ζr, φr and κr alone, for r = n, n − 1, . . . , 1.

The two U-systems appearing here may be dressed with boundary edge labels in many
ways to yield pairs of bijectively related LR-hives. For example, (11.7) in which all Ui5
are set equal to 0 would yield the example shown on the left below. More generally, the
only requirements are those following from (11.1). Here these amoumt to the conditions
µ1 − µ2 ≥ 1, µ2 − µ3 ≥ 2, µ3 − µ4 ≥ 2, µ4 ≥ 0 and ν1 − ν2 ≥ 1, ν2 − ν3 ≥ 3, ν3 − ν4 ≥ 1,

In this case the result on the right follows immediately from that on the left, since quite
generally, we can add p, q and r to all α-, β- and γ-edge labels of H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) without
altering the values of Uij for any i, j, provided that r = p + q, and without violating any
LR-hive conditions, provided in addition that p, q, r ∈ Z≥0. This amounts to replacing the
boundary edge labels λ, µ and ν by λ+(rn), µ+(pn) and ν +(qn), respectively. Thereafter,
it is only necessary to insert in the appropriate place in examples of the type 8.3 the action
of additional operations χq
k for k = 1, 2, . . . , n. This only has the eﬀect of adding
q, p and r = p + q to all α-, β- and γ-edge labels of K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ), including of course
the boundary edge labels, without altering the values of Vij for any i, j.

k and ωp

In the above n = 4 example we simply took p = 2 and q = 4 so that r = 6. The
bijective nature of σ(4) then contributes to the proof that c8654
8742,9854 =
c14 12 11 10
9854,8742 . Four other pairs of similar maps involving the same boundary edge labels but
diﬀerent pairs of U-systems, U (4) and V (4), complete the proof, since c8654
8742,9854 =

where, as usual m = −m for any integer m.

Here our hives are no longer Littlewood–Richardson hives since their boundary edge
labels, and indeed their interior edge labels as well, are no longer non-negative. However,
they have a character theoretic signiﬁcance since the enumeration of hives of this type

100

with given boundary edge labels serves to give the multiplicities of irreducible constituents
in the decomposition of a product of irreducible rational characters of GLn(C). These
irreducible rational characters, s(λ;ρ)(x1, . . . , xn), are speciﬁed by pairs of partitions [AK70,
Ki70, St87, Koi89]

(λ; ρ) = (λ1, λ2, . . . , λℓ(λ), 0, . . . , 0, ρℓ(ρ) . . . , ρ2, ρ1) with ℓ(λ) + ℓ(ρ) ≤ n.

(11.11)

The product rule can then be written in the form

s(µ;σ)(x1, . . . , xn) s(ν;τ )(x1, . . . , xn) =Xλ,ρ

In the case of our n = 4 example, we have

c(λ;ρ)
(µ;σ),(ν;τ ) s(λ;ρ)(x1, . . . , xn) .

(11.12)

c(2;12)
(43;2),(1;34) = c(2;12)

(1;34),(43;2) = 5 ,

(11.13)

where redundant parts equal to 0 have been dropped, and the existence of the bijectve
map σ(4) on U-systems is responsible for the ﬁrst equality, and the second follows from
the fact that for all n ∈ N

c(λ;ρ)+((p+q)n)
(µ;σ)+(pn),(ν;τ )+(qn) = c(λ;ρ)

(µ;σ),(ν;τ )

(11.14)

for all p, q ∈ Z. This identity is a consequence of the fact that

s(µ;σ)+(pn)(x1, . . . , xn) = (x1 · · · xn)p s(µ;σ)(x1, . . . , xn)

(11.15)

for all µ, σ and p.

It follows from this that we have a combinatorial hive-based interpretation of the

coeﬃcients

c(λ;ρ)
(µ;σ),(ν;τ )

(11.16)

and that the existence of our bijective, involutive map σ(n) provides a combinatorial proof
of the symmetry property

(µ;σ),(ν;τ ) = c(λ;ρ)
c(λ;ρ)

(ν;τ ),(µ;σ) .

(11.17)

It might ﬁnally be noted that the above result on multiplicities of irreducible rational
characters of GLn(C) may be extended to the case of irrational characters of certain
covering groups of GLn(C) by extending the argument to the case of all p, q ∈ R or
indeed all p, q ∈ C.

12 Discussion of the coincidence of commutativity bi-

jections

We review here the coincidence of the fundamental symmetry maps ρ1, ρ2, ρ′
2 in [PV10],
the Henriques–Kamnitzer crystal commutor [HK06a] and hive commutor [HK06b], as well

101

as the commutativity bijection of Danilov and Koshevoy [DK05, DK08] on arrays. Our
own commutativity bijections on tableaux and hives both correspond to the fundamen-
tal symmetry map referred to as ρ3 in [PV10]. As we have pointed out in Section 2,
Littlewood–Richardson coeﬃcients may be evaluated by means of Gelfand–Tsetlin pat-
terns as in [GZ86] and [BZ89]. The ﬁrst method amounts to exploiting a bijection, τ ,
between LR tableaux of shape λ/µ and weight ν, and GT patterns of type ν and weight
λ − µ satisfying a µ-dominance condition, as in (2.32), which is equivalent to the non-
negativity of the right leaning rhombus gradients Rij, as on the left hand side of (2.17),
and the second method amounts to exploiting another bijection, γ, between LR tableaux
of shape λ/µ and weight ν, and GT patterns of type µ and weight the reverse of λ−ν satis-
fying a condition, as in (2.33), which is equivalent to the non-negativity of the left leaning
rhombus gradients Lij, as on the right hand side of (2.17). See also [KB96, HK06b, PV10].
In [PV10], Section 4.5, the deﬁnitions of bijections, τ and γ are expressed in terms of semi-
standard Young tableaux rather than Gelfand–Tsetlin patterns. However, these diﬀerent
formulations can be readily translated into the language of hives since the relevant GT
patterns are precisely those exempliﬁed by G(α)
in (2.21) augmented by appro-
priate missing right and left hand boundary edge labels, as will be illustrated below.

12.1 Littlewood-Richardson rule, gln-crystal bases and crystal

commutor

Following [KTW04b] and using gln-crystal bases, Henriques and Kamnitzer studied, in
[HK06a], the hive model for the general linear Lie algebra, gln, tensor products, and
established relations between hives, tableaux, Gelfand–Tsetlin patterns, and crystal bases.
Crystal bases of integrable representations of the quantum group Uq(gln) [Kas91] enjoy
nice properties. In the remainder of this subsection, Greek letters λ, µ or ν will be used
to represent partitions of length ≤ n. For each such λ, let Bλ denote the crystal basis
of the irreducible representation Vλ of Uq(gln). The crystal tensor product Bµ ⊗ Bν gives
a crystal basis of the tensor product of the representations Vµ ⊗ Vν of Uq(gln), and its
decomposition into connected components comes from a direct sum decomposition of
Vµ ⊗ Vν into irreducible Uq(gln)-submodules. Each connected component of Bµ ⊗ Bν is
isomorphic to some Bλ as a crystal, and each Bλ has a unique highest weight element of
weight λ and a unique lowest weight element of weight rev(λ) = w0λ, where w0 is the
longest element of the Weyl group. Thus we may evaluate cλ
µν by counting the connected
components in Bµ ⊗Bν isomorphic to Bλ, or equivalently, the highest (resp. lowest) weight
elements of weight λ (resp. rev(λ)) in Bµ ⊗ Bν.

There is a “reversing” map ξ [HK06a] acting on any disjoint union of the crystals of
the form Bλ, including Bµ ⊗ Bν, preserving each connected component but exchanging
its highest and lowest weight elements. In [HK06a] it was shown that it is an involution
using a certain uniqueness theorem on crystals.

In the case of gln, we can take Bλ to be the set of all semistandard tableaux of shape
λ, in the alphabet {1, . . . , n}, suitably equipped with crystal operators [Nak93]. Then the
highest weight element is the Yamanouchi tableau Yλ, exempliﬁed on the left below, and

102

the lowest weight element ξ(Yλ), exempliﬁed on the right below. The map ξ coincides
with the Sch¨utzenberger involution acting on semistandard tableaux.

The crystal version of the Littlewood–Richardson rule [Tho78, Nak93, Kwo09] clariﬁes
the equality cλ
µν = |LR(λ/µ, ν)| by identifying all highest weight elements of weight λ in
Bµ ⊗ Bν to be exactly the ones of the form Yµ ⊗ T (β)
, as exempliﬁed in
(2.21), is the semistandard tableau corresponding to the GT pattern G(β)
obtained from
ν
T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) in the manner described at the end of Section 2.3. Let BT , for T ∈
LR(λ/µ, ν), denote the connected component of Bµ ⊗ Bν, isomorphic to Bλ with highest
weight element Yµ ⊗ T (β)
. In [HK06b] it was also shown that the lowest weight element of
BT is T (α)

corresponding to the GT pattern G(α)

For the sake of comparison, we note that in [HK06b] the order of tensor factors is
reverse to, say, the one used in [Kas91, Nak93] which we adopt here; compare [HK06b, p.
15, 1st paragraph of Section 5.2] and [Nak93, Theorem 1.1.5]. Note also that the drawings
of hives in [HK06b] employ an orientation diﬀerent from that adopted here.

The tensor product of crystals is not symmetric in the sense that the map from A ⊗ B
to B ⊗A sending each a⊗b to b⊗a does not commute with the crystal operators. Instead,
Henriques and Kamnitzer [HK06a] show that the map σA,B : a ⊗ b 7→ ξ(ξ(b) ⊗ ξ(a)) does
give a crystal isomorphism from A ⊗ B to B ⊗ A, and that it has the involutive nature
expressed by σB,AσA,B = 1. Through this isomorphism applied to Bµ ⊗ Bν, they deﬁne
an involution ComHK : LR(λ/µ, ν) → LR(λ/ν, µ), sending each T to T ∗ say, in such a
way that σBµ,Bν (BT ) = BT ∗ (note that BT ⊂ Bµ ⊗ Bν while BT ∗ ⊂ Bν ⊗ Bµ). Since
the map a ⊗ b 7→ ξ(b) ⊗ ξ(a) sends the highest weight element Yµ ⊗ T (β)
ν ∈ BT to the
) = (T ∗)(α)
lowest weight element (T ∗)(α)
ν . Similarly we
have ξ(T (α)
µ . In terms of the deﬁnitions of τ and γ given in [PV10], these two
formulae take the form ξ(τ (T )) = γ(T ∗) and ξ(γ(T )) = τ (T ∗). This means that both
2 = γ−1ξτ deﬁned in [PV10] coincide with ComHK and are involutions.

12.2 LR commutativity bijections and their coincidence

In [PV10], it is conjectured that ρ1, ρ2, and ρ′
2, the inverse of ρ2, and the fundamental sym-
metry map ρ3, described in [PV10], deﬁned originally in [Aze99, Aze00] and fully detailed
here as ρ(n), coincide. From the gln-crystal commutor arguments above we know that
ρ2 = ρ′
2 = ComHK. Using a special case of octahedron recurrence in [KTW04b],
Henriques and Kamnitzer construct a bijective commutor, Comh
HK, from hives of bound-
ary (λ, µ, ν) to those of boundary (λ, ν, µ) [HK06a]. The bijection starts with a hive H

2 = ρ−1

103

and consists of a series of intermediate stages whose intermediate objects are not hives. It
becomes a hive H ∗ again in the last step. The involution property is not proved directly.
It is shown that in the equivalent language of GT patterns or semistandard tableaux,
intermediate stages correspond to a sequence of Bender–Knuth moves [BK72] applied to
T (α)
µ whose result is the same as applying the Sch¨utzenberger involution. This implies
that Comh
HK = ComHK (via the identiﬁcation of LR tableaux and LR hives by way of
f (n)), from which it follows that the Henriques–Kamnitzer hive commutor Comh
HK is also
an involution. Therefore Comh

HK = ComHK = ρ2 = ρ′

2 = ρ−1
2 .

In [DK05] Danilov and Koshevoy introduce a theory of arrays suited to discrete concave
functions (hives) on the lattice of integers as well as to Young tableaux. The set of
arrays is then equipped with the crystal structure and the tensor product of crystal
arrays is considered. Using the Sch¨utzenberger involution, a commutor for the tensor
product of arrays is introduced. Then it is shown that it coincides with Henriques–
Kamnitzer commutor as well as with the bijections ρ1, ρ2 and ρ′
2 deﬁned in terms of
Young tableaux. This proves the Pak–Vallejo aforementioned conjecture leaving ρ3 out.
The main philosophy in [Aze08] is to claim that ρ3 can be seen as providing a short cut of
tableau-switching when this procedure is applied to LR tableaux, and thereby it coincides
with ρ1.

Illustration of the maps γ, τ and ξ

Consider the following example, based on the parameters of (4.4) and (8.3).
Example 12.1. In the case n = 4 and λ = (8, 6, 5, 4), µ = (6, 5, 2, 0) and ν = (5, 4, 1, 0),
let a typical LR tableau T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) and the corresponding LR hive H ∈ H(n)(λ/µ, ν)
be as shown below.

Continuing with this example, we are now in a position to compare the output of
Examples 4.4 and 8.3 with the corresponding result obtained through the action of the
Henriques–Kamnitzer hives commutor Comh

HK or octahedral map in [HK06b].

Applying the Sch¨utzenberger involution ξ to T (α)

in the form of Bender–Knuth moves
gives a succession of semistandard tableaux whose Gelfand–Tsetlin patterns correspond
to the sequence of quasi-hives generated by the action of the octahedral map Comh
HK.
At the end a semistandard tableau ξ(T (α)
µ ) is arrived at whose GT pattern, denoted by
ξ(G(α)
µ ), of type µ and weight λ − ν corresponds to a hive K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ), as illustrated
below:

It is easy to see that this GT pattern is the reoriented form of the constituent GT pattern
of the hive K appearing at the end of Example 8.3. It has type µ = (6, 5, 2, 0) and weight
λ − ν = (3, 2, 4, 4), and the bijection between LR hives and LR tableaux allows us to
construct the correponding LR tableau S that appears at the end of Example 4.4, as
shown below:

This coincidence with the output of our previous Examples 8.3 and 4.4 supports the
case for the coincidence of ρ2 and ρ3, that was exempliﬁed by means of a reﬁnement of
the path deletion operations in [Aze08].

13 Concluding remarks

We have given direct combinatorial proofs, using two distinct models, of the bijective and
involutive nature of a procedure ﬁrst introduced by Azenhas [Aze99, Aze00] as a means

105

of establishing combinatorially the symmetry of Littlewood–Richardson coeﬃcients. The
ﬁrst model was based on the use of Littlewood–Richardson tableaux and followed Azen-
has’s procedure in providing a commutativity operator, denoted here by ρ(n), mapping
a given LR tableau T ∈ LR(λ/µ, ν) to a new LR tableau S ∈ LR(λ/ν, µ), thereby
preserving the outer shape while interchanging the inner shape and the weight. The
transformation from T to S consisted of a sequence of deletions from T , starting from
right to left in each row taken in turn from bottom to top, with the new tableau S con-
structed by arranging the terminating row numbers obtained from the deletions in the
form of a tableau, starting from its bottom row and proceeding upwards, as exempliﬁed
in Example 4.4. The second model was based on the use of Littlewood–Richardson hives,
on which we deﬁned a corresponding commutativity operator which we denoted by σ(n).
It transforms a given LR hive H ∈ H(n)(λ, µ, ν) to a new LR hive K ∈ H(n)(λ, ν, µ) by
the application of what we called path removals from H, working again from right to
left, with each path starting from the base of the hive, and recording within K the level
reached by each path, as exemplifed this time in Example 8.3.

Although it was not stated explicitly in the text, it should be understood that the two
procedures, one in the realm of tableaux and the other in that of hives, are intimately
related at every stage by the bijective correspondence f (n) between LR tableaux and
LR hives, as described in Section 2.3. Nevertheless, we have been at pains to keep the
two procedures self-contained, without interrupting them in Sections 3-6 and Sections 7-
10 with repetitious accounts of the connection between them.
In fact each of the two
formulations has its own particular merits and the development of the argument in the
tableaux setting has beneﬁtted from insights obtained in the hive setting and vice versa.
