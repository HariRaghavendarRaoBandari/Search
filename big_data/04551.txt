Up-Hill Diﬀusion Creating Density Gradient - What is the Proper Entropy?

Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8561, Japan

(Dated: March 16, 2016)

N. Sato and Z. Yoshida

It is always some constraint that yields any nontrivial structure from statistical averages. As
epitomized by the Boltzmann distribution, the energy conservation is often the principal constraint
acting on mechanical systems. Here, we investigate a diﬀerent type: the topological constraint
imposed on ‘space’. Such constraint emerges from the null space of the Poisson operator linking
energy gradient to phase space velocity, and appears as an adiabatic invariant altering the preserved
phase space volume at the core of statistical mechanics. The correct measure of entropy, built
on the distorted invariant measure, behaves consistently with the second law of thermodynamics.
The opposite behavior (decreasing entropy and negative entropy production) arises in arbitrary
coordinates. An ensamble of rotating rigid bodies is worked out. The theory is then applied to
up-hill diﬀusion in a magnetosphere.

There are plenty of examples that seemingly violate
the principle of entropy maximization. So-called up-hill
diﬀusion, creating density gradients, is often observed in
multi-phase ﬂuids and solids undergoing spinodal decom-
position [1, 2], in metallic alloys [3], nanoporous materials
[4], and magmas [5]. By separating the diﬀerent compo-
nents of the mixture, Helmholtz free energy achieves a
local minimum, characterized by non-uniform concentra-
tions, that is stable against ﬂuctuations [2]. With a com-
pletely diﬀerent mechanism, astronomical plasmas accu-
mulate within the magnetic ﬁelds of stars and planets
through the process of inward diﬀusion [6–9] and gen-
erate an heterogeneous density proﬁle. That the driving
force is not the energy constraint is made apparent by the
experimental observation of non-neutral plasma particles
climbing up the potential hill [8], as well as by numerical
calculations concerning their thermal equilibrium [10].
Here, the underlying principle is the self-organization of
a quasi-stationary state, governed by long-range interac-
tions, that feeds upon the topological constraints (typi-
cally in the form of adiabatic or Casimir invariants [11])
aﬀecting canonical phase space. As long as the invari-
ants are preserved, the ordered architecture, arising from
the integral manifolds foliating phase space, seems to be
conﬂicting with the second law of thermodynamics. Once
the invariants are broken, the quasi-stationary state is de-
stroyed and the systems progressively approach thermal
death. Accretion of galaxies under the action of gravita-
tion [12, 13], ferromagnetism mediated by the magnetic
ﬁeld [14, 15], spontaneous creation of planetary magne-
tospheres through the electromagnetic interaction [6–8],
vortical structures in magnetoﬂuids preserving helicities
[16], living organisms harvesting ‘negentropy’ [17], self-
organization of data ﬂows in information theory [18] are
some of the most paradigmatic examples of such ordered
structures that grow on the topological invariants aﬀect-
ing the relevant ‘phase space’.

In the present paper, we study the non-equilibrium
statistical mechanics of Hamiltonian systems subjected
to the aforementioned topological constraints. In partic-

ular, we show that the entropy deﬁned on the invariant
measure (the preserved phase space volume) of the sys-
tem behaves consistently with the second law of thermo-
dynamics. Due to the non-covariant nature of diﬀerential
entropy [19, 20], the time evolution of the uncertainty
measured in arbitrary coordinates may ‘ﬂip’, and appear
as an entropy decrease in the Cartesian perspective. It
is the Jacobian of the coordinate change that yields the
ordered structure, while the probability distribution is
ﬂattened in the proper variables.

The theory, which ﬁnds its roots in the phenomenolog-
ical observation that particle density in planetary mag-
netopsheres tends to be homogenized in the magnetic
coordinates [21, 22], shows that the proper phase space
upon which statistical mechanics can be formulated dif-
fers from the a priori variables used to represent a gen-
eral physical system. These ﬁndings may pave the way
for a new and rigorous understanding of the statistical
mechanics governing constrained systems.

We start with a short review of the Hamiltonian for-
malism. Hamiltonian mechanics is the result of interac-
tion between matter (energy or Hamiltonian function H)
and space (Poisson operator J ) according to the equa-
tion:

v = J ∇H,

(1)

where v = ˙x is the ﬂow velocity in n-dimensional phase
space. (1) admits two typologies of constants of motion:
those that can be ascribed to the speciﬁc form of the
Hamiltonian function, i.e. to the properties of matter,
and the so-called Casimir invariants that originate from
the eigenvectors with 0-eigenvalue (the null space or ker-
nel) of the Poisson operator, i.e.
from the properties
of space. This second kind of invariants, which limits
the accessible regions of phase space as a result of the
constraining environment, is at the core of the theory
developed in the present work. Speciﬁcally, due to an-
tisymmetry J T = −J , whenever the operator J has a
kernel ξ such that J ξ = 0, the system is subjected to

topological constraints:

ξ · v = 0.

(2)

(2) can be thought as the formal deﬁnition of topolog-
ical constraint. We remark that the above result holds
for any Hamiltonian, and even if J does not satisfy the
Jacobi identity (see [23]). However, thanks to Darboux’s
theorem [24], the Jacobi identity ensures that the kernel
is integrable, i.e. that a Casmir invariant exists:

ξ = λ∇C,

(3)
where, for now, we assumed that the rank of J is n − 1
(see [25]), and the two functions λ and C are integra-
tion factor and Casimir invariant ( ˙C = λ−1ξ · v = 0)
respectively.

It is now useful to make some considerations on the
non-covariant nature of diﬀerential entropy. Extension
of Shannon’s discrete entropy to continuous probability
distributions is a delicate process [19, 20].
Indeed, the
quantity:

(cid:90)

V

˜S = −

p (x) log p (x)dV

(4)

is not, in general, the entropy of the continuous prob-
ability distribution p (x) on the volume element dV =
dx1 ∧ ... ∧ dxn. The reason is that ˜S is not covariant,
i.e. its value changes depending on the chosen coordinate
system, and (4) tacitly assumes that dV is an invariant
measure. Unfortunately, this is not always the case and
(4) has to be amended with Jaynes’ functional:

(cid:90)

V

(cid:18) p (x)

(cid:19)

I (x)

SJ = −

p (x) log

dV ,

(5)

where the Jacobian I (x) compensates the coordinate de-
pendence of the logarithm. In the Hamiltonian picture,
one can always ﬁnd a time-independent function I (x)
nullifying the Lie derivative of IdV with respect to the
dynamical ﬂow v, i.e. such that LvI (x) dV = 0. The
obtained I with (5) will then give the desired covariant
form of entropy. It is useful to recast (5) as below:

P (y) log P (y)dVI .

(6)

VI

Here, P is the probability distribution of y and dVI is the
invariant measure of the system dVI = dy1 ∧ ... ∧ dyn =
IdV satisfying LudVI = 0, with u = ˙y.

We are now ready to test the theory with a simple
3D example. In 3D, equation (1) can always be cast in
the form v = w × ∇H, where w is a properly chosen

(cid:90)

Σ = −

vector (see [26]). The Euler’s rotation equation for the
motion of a rigid body with angular momentum x and
moments of inertia Ix, Iy, and Iz can be obtained by set-

ting H = (cid:0)x2/Ix + y2/Iy + z2/Iz

(cid:1) /2 and w = x. The

kernel ξ associated to this operator, i.e. the topological
constraint (2) aﬀecting the phase space of a rigid body, is
soon identiﬁed to be ξ = x. Indeed, ξ·v = x·x×∇H = 0.
At the same time, one can verify that the Jacobi iden-
tity (see [27]) is satisﬁed x · ∇ × x = 0, making the
system Hamiltonian. The Jacobi identity also guaran-
tees that the kernel is integrable (remember (3)) to give
the integration factor λ = 1 and the Casimir invariant
C = x2/2, so that w = ∇C. Furthermore, the invariant
measure turns out to be dVI = dx ∧ dy ∧ dz, as follows
from ∇ · v = 0. Since this is the original statistical mea-
sure, one can directly apply (4) to deﬁne the entropy of
an ensemble of such rigid bodies. However, suppose that
we consider a slightly more complicated rotation pattern,
such as:

v = λ(x)∇ x2
2

× ∇H,

(7)
where, for example, λ = ez2/2. Since ˙z ∝ λ, high val-
ues of z will be less probable and (7) may represent the
anisotropic rotation of a rigid body that tends to spin
around the axis with angular momenta x, y. (7) still sat-
isﬁes the Jacobi identity, and thus represents an Hamilto-
nian system with the same Casimir element C. However,
the invariant measure becomes:

dVI = e−z2/2dx ∧ dy ∧ dz = dC ∧ dχ ∧ dz,

(8)

where we introduced new coordinates (C, χ, z), with χ =
e−z2/2 arctan (y/x). Separating the constant of motion
C, the new 2D canonical equations are:

(cid:20) ˙χ
(cid:21)

(9)

One can verify that (9) is divergence free.

In order to study the statistical mechanics of the new
system, we now consider an ensemble of objects obeying
(9) and let them interact by adding to the Hamiltonian
an interaction potential φ. Its ensemble average must go
zero (cid:104)φ(cid:105) = 0, since the total energy of the system has to
be preserved. In addition, and this is the key point of
the paper, there are grounds for the ergodic hypothesis
in the novel coordinates (C, χ, z) (and not in the original
variables (x, y, z)) because of the invariant measure (8).
In other words, it is licit to exchange ensemble averages
with time averages only on (8):

0 =(cid:104)dφ(cid:105) = (cid:104)φχ(cid:105) dχ + (cid:104)φz(cid:105) dz =

¯φχdχ + ¯φzdz = ¯Γχ (t) dχ + ¯Γz (t) dz,

(10)

3

with Γχ and Γz Gaussian white noises and where the bar
indicates long-time averaging. In (10) ﬁrst we substituted
ensemble averages with time averages, and then repre-
sented the various components with random processes of
zero time average. We remark that this would not have
been possible in the original coordinates (x, y, z), as they
are not measure preserving. Neglecting the constant C,
the equations accounting for the interaction become:

Initial condition is a ﬂat
distribution f on dV .

Note that, while the Hamiltonian is no more a constant,
C is still a Casimir invariant: the rigid bodies will explore
the surface of phase space deﬁned by C.

The next step is to build the Fokker-Planck equation
associated to (11). We refer the reader to [9, 29] for a
detailed description of the procedure. The result is:

Here P is the probability distribution on (χ, z) and Dχ,
Dz are the diﬀusion coeﬃcients associated with the white
noises. Finally, we seek for an explicit expression of the
entropy production rate σ of the system. Deﬁne the
Fokker-Planck velocity Z to be the vector ﬁeld such that
(12) is written as ∂tP = −∇ · (ZP ). Then, recalling (6):

{P∇ · Z + ∇ · [P log (P ) Z]}dVI .

The ﬁrst term represents the ensemble average of the

diﬀusion ﬂattens the distribution P and since preserva-
tion of particle number requires P dVI = f dV , f = P/λ
creates an ordered structure by approaching f ∝ λ−1.

Let us show how the theory can be applied to the study
In
of a real self-organizing system: a magnetosphere.
astronomical plasmas, charged particles are trapped by
planetary magnetospheres as they spiral around the mag-
netic ﬁeld B = ∇ψ × ∇θ, where ψ = ψ(r, z) is the ﬂux-
function and θ the toroidal angle of a cylindrical coordi-
nate system (r, z, θ). This dynamics (cyclotron motion)
is characterized by preservation of the magnetic moment
µ = mv2⊥/2B = const, where m is the particle mass,
v⊥ the particle velocity perpendicular to magnetic ﬁeld
lines, and B = |B|. Because of the topological constraint
µ, it turns out [9, 30] that the invariant measure of mag-
netized particles is dVI = dµ ∧ dv(cid:107) ∧ dl ∧ dψ ∧ dθ =
Bdµ ∧ dv(cid:107) ∧ dx ∧ dy ∧ dz = BdV , where l and v(cid:107) are
length and velocity along B respectively. The electro-
magnetic interaction diﬀuse the constrained particles on
the statistical measure dVI and maximize the associated
entropy Σ. Due to the inhomogeneous Jacobian B, the
process will appear as creating density gradients and tem-
perature anisotropy in the Cartesian perspective, while
the entropy ˜S deﬁned on dV is minimized. This scenario
is exempliﬁed in ﬁgures 2 and 3 obtained by simulation
of the Fokker-Planck equation derived in [9, 30].

In ﬁgure 1 we report the results of the numerical sim-
ulation of (12). The Entropy Σ, deﬁned on the invari-
ant measure (8) of the system, behaves consistently with
the second law of thermodynamics and the associated
entropy production σ is positive. On the contrary, the

wrong measure of entropy ˜S = −(cid:82) f log f dV = Σ + (cid:104)λ(cid:105),

deﬁned by the distribution function f on the original
phase space dV = dx ∧ dy ∧ dz, decreases. Furthermore,

the degeneracy of the Poisson algebra will be given later
on. When the constraint is integrable,
it is called a
Casimir invariant in the context of non-canonical Hamil-
tonian mechanics. The correspondence with adiabatic in-
variants of classical mechanics is discussed in Z. Yoshida

[23] This identity is satisﬁed by any Poisson operator and is
the essential feature of the algebraic structure of Hamil-
tonian systems. Deﬁning the Poisson bracket of two func-
tions f and g as {f, g} = ∇f ·J ∇g, the identity for three
functions f , g, and h reads {f,{g, h}} + {g,{h, f}} +
{h,{f, g}} = 0.

[25] If the rank of J is n − k and the Jacobi identity is sat-
isﬁed, there will be k Casimir invariants. Again, this is a
consequence of Darboux’s theorem [24].

[26] If w = B/B2 with B the magnetic ﬁeld, and setting
H = φ, with φ the electric potential, one obtains the
equations of motion for a magnetized particle performing
E × B drift. In vacuum, B = ∇ξ for some pontetial ξ.
In this case, ξ is a Casimir invariant.
[27] In 3D the Jacobi identity reads as w · ∇ × w = 0. When
satisﬁed, the constraint w · v = 0 is integrable [28], and
thus two scalars λ and C can be found such that w =
λ∇C. Furthermore, I = λ−1 deﬁnes an invariant measure
since ∇ · (Iv) = 0, with the result that, in 3D, Jacobi
identity, Casimir invariant, and invariant measure imply
each other provided that v = w × ∇H.
