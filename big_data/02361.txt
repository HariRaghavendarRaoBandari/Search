GLOBAL DYNAMICS ABOVE THE FIRST EXCITED ENERGY

FOR THE NONLINEAR SCHR ¨ODINGER EQUATION

WITH A POTENTIAL

KENJI NAKANISHI

Abstract. Consider the focusing nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (NLS) with a
potential with a single negative eigenvalue.
It has solitons with negative small
energy, which are asymptotically stable, and solitons with positive large energy,
which are unstable. We classify the global dynamics into 9 sets of solutions in the
phase space including both solitons, restricted by small mass, radial symmetry,
and an energy bound slightly above the second lowest one of solitons. The classiﬁ-
cation includes a stable set of solutions which start near the ﬁrst excited solitons,
approach the ground states locally in space for large time with large radiation to
the spatial inﬁnity, and blow up in negative ﬁnite time.

1. Introduction

We continue from [5] the study of global dynamics for the nonlinear Schr¨odinger

equation with a potential V = V (|x|) : R3 → R which decays as |x| → ∞,

i ˙u + Hu = |u|2u, H := −∆ + V,
in the case H has a bound state 0 < φ0 ∈ L2(R3)

e0 < 0,

(1.2)

and no other eigenfunction nor resonance (so φ0 is the ground state of H). Hence-
forth, k · kp denotes the Lp(R3) norm. See Section 1.5 for the precise assumptions
on V . As a simple case, it suﬃces to assume V = V (|x|) ∈ S(R3) besides the above
spectral condition.
In [5], the global behavior was investigated for all radial solutions u with small

for some small ε > 0, where E1(µ) denotes the second lowest energy of solitons
for the prescribed mass M(u) = µ. The goal of this paper is to give a complete
classiﬁcation of global dynamics including both stable and unstable solitons, as
well as scattering and blow-up, in a phase space restricted only by the conserved
quantities and the symmetry. The main questions are which initial data u(0) lead
to each type of solutions, and how the solution u can change its behavior from one
type to another along its evolution. See [5, Introduction], [6] and references therein
for more background and motivation of this setting.

1.1. Solitons. In order to state the main result precisely, we ﬁrst need to deﬁne
the energy levels of the ground state and the excited states. Consider the elliptic
equation for the solution of the form u(t) = e−itωϕ(x) for any time frequency ω ∈ R
(1.4)

(H + ω)ϕ = |ϕ|2ϕ

and let S be the set of all radial solutions

S := {ϕ ∈ H 1

r (R3) | ∃ω > 0, s.t. (1.4)},

(1.5)

where H 1
r (R3) denotes the subspace of radially symmetric functions of H 1(R3) with
the norm kϕk2
2. The restriction to ω > 0 comes from the absence
of embedded eigenvalue for the Schr¨odinger operator −∆ + V − |ϕ|2, which follows
from the ODE in the radial setting. The ground state energy level is deﬁned for
each prescribed mass µ > 0 by

H 1 = k∇ϕk2

2 + kϕk2

E0(µ) := inf{E(ϕ) | ϕ ∈ S , M(ϕ) = µ},
and the j-th excited state energy level is deﬁned inductively by

Ej(µ) := inf{E(ϕ) | ϕ ∈ S , M(ϕ) = µ, E(ϕ) > Ej−1(µ)}

together with the corresponding set of solitons

(1.6)

(1.7)

Sj := {ϕ ∈ S | E(ϕ) = Ej(M(ϕ))}.

(1.8)
The small mass constraint M(u) ≪ 1 enables us to identify the ground states S0
as bifurcation of the linear ground state φ0 for ω → −e0 + 0, and the ﬁrst excited
states S1 as rescaled perturbation for ω → ∞ of the ground state Q of the nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equation without the potential:

i ˙u − ∆u = |u|2u.

More precisely, let Q ∈ H 1(R3) be the unique positive radial solution of

−∆Q + Q = Q3.

There are constants 0 < µ∗, z∗ ≪ 1 ≪ ω∗ < ∞ and C 1 maps

(Φ, Ω) : Z∗ := {z ∈ C | |z| < z∗} → H 1
Ψ : [ω∗,∞) → H 1

r (R3),

r (R3) × (−e0,∞)

such that (ϕ, ω) = (Φ[z], Ω[z]), (Ψ[ω], ω) are solutions of (1.4) satisfying
kγkH 1 . |z|3, Ω[z] = −e0 + O(|z|2),

γ ⊥ φ0,

Φ[z] = zφ0 + γ,
Ψ[ω](|x|) = ω1/2(Q + γ)(ω1/2x),

with asymptotic formulas of mass and energy

M(Φ[z]) = |z|2/2 + O(|z|6), E(Φ[z]) = e0|z|2/2 + O(|z|4),
M(Ψ[ω]) = ω−1/2M(Q) + O(ω−3/4), E(Ψ[ω]) = ω1/2E(Q) + O(ω1/4),
M(Ψ[ω]) ∼ −ω−3/2, and
S0|M<µ∗ = {Φ[z] | z ∈ Z∗}, S1|M<µ∗ = {eiθΨ[ω] | θ ∈ R, ω > ω∗}.

is identical to M(ϕ) if ϕ is a solution of (1.10). A proof of the above statements is
given in [2, Lemma 2.1] for the ground state part, and in Lemma 2.6 for the excited
state part.

1.2. Types of behavior. In this paper, we consider the following three types of
behavior of the solution u, both in positive time and in negative time, which leads
to a classiﬁcation into 9 non-empty sets of solutions.

(1) Scattering to the ground states S0.
(2) Blow-up.
(3) Trapping by the ﬁrst excited states S1.

All the solutions below the excited states E(u) < E1(M(u)) are completely split
into (1) and (2) with the same behavior in t > 0 and in t < 0, which is explicitly
predictable by the initial data, using the virial functional:
rVr|u|2

K2(u) := ∂α=1E(α3/2u(αx)) =ZR3 |∇u|2 −

where r := |x| is the radial variable. See [5, Theorem 1.1] for the precise statement.
The diﬀerence between below and above the excited energy are the new type (3), and
solutions with diﬀerent types of behavior in t > 0 and in t < 0, namely transition
among (1)–(3).

dx,

(1.17)

The following are precise deﬁnitions for (1)–(3), under the small mass constraint.
Let u be a solution of (1.1). The local wellposedness in H 1(R3) implies that the
maximal existence interval (T−(u), T+(u)) ⊂ R is uniquely deﬁned such that

u ∈ C((T−(u), T+(u)); H 1(R3))

solves (1.1) for T−(u) < t < T+(u).

We say that u blows up in t > 0, if T+(u) < ∞. Otherwise, we say that u is global
in t > 0. We say that u scatters to the ground states (or scatters to Φ in short) as
t → ∞, if for some C 1 function z : (T−(u),∞) → Z∗ and u+ ∈ H 1

It dominates the homogeneous Sobolev norm ˙H 1/2 uniformly, and is the appropriate
rescaling for the ﬁrst excited states, because

(1.21)

The open neighborhood of the small-mass part of S1 within distance δ > 0 in this
metric is denoted by

Nδ(Ψ) := {ϕ ∈ H 1

r (R3) | ∃θ ∈ R, ∃ω > ω∗, keiθΨ[ω] − ϕkH 1

We say that u is trapped by the ﬁrst excited states (or trapped by Ψ in short) as
t → ∞, if u(t) ∈ Nδ(Ψ) for large t and some small ﬁxed 0 < δ ≪ 1.
solutions as follows. If u scatters to Φ as t → ∞, then

We can easily distinguish the above three types using the L4

where Ψ[ω] is estimated by (2.30)-(2.31) and the remainder is bounded by Gagliardo-

1.3. The main result. We consider the following set of initial data where the mass
is bounded and the energy is allowed to exceed the ﬁrst excited state slightly:

Hµ,ε := {ϕ ∈ H 1

r (R3) | M(ϕ) < µ, E(ϕ) < E1(M(ϕ))(1 + ε2)}.
These initial data can be classiﬁed by behavior of the solution in t > 0:

S := {u(0) ∈ H 1
B := {u(0) ∈ H 1
Tδ := {u(0) ∈ H 1

r (R3) | u scatters to Φ as t → ∞},
r (R3) | u blows up in t > 0},
r (R3) | u(t) ∈ Nδ(Ψ) for large t},

(1.27)

(1.28)

where u is the solution of (1.1) for the initial data u(0). The same classiﬁcation for
t < 0 is given by their complex conjugate, thanks to the time inversion symmetry:
if u(t, x) is a solution of (1.9), then so is ¯u(−t, x).
Theorem 1.1. If µ and ε are small enough, then we have the following.

Hµ,ε ⊂ S ∪ B ∪ Tδ,

(1.29)

for some δ ≤ Cε, where C > 0 is some constant independent of µ, ε > 0. Each of
the 9 combinations of dynamics in positive and negative time

Hµ,ε ∩ X ∩ Y, X ,Y ∈ {S,B,Tδ},

(1.30)
contain inﬁnitely many orbits. S is open. Tδ∩Hµ,ε is a C 1 manifold of codimension 1
r (R3), connected and unbounded. Tδ∩Tδ∩Hµ,ε is a C 1 manifold of codimension
in H 1
2, connected and contained in Nδ′(Ψ) for some δ′ ≤ Cδ. There is a connected open
neighborhood of Tδ ∩ Hµ,ε which is separated by Tδ into two connected open sets
contained respectively in S and in B. Tδ ∩ Hµ,ε is also separated by Tδ into two
manifolds contained respectively in S and in B.

Next, some new notation and symbols are introduced. For any symbols F, X, Y ,

the diﬀerence is denoted by (this is a slight modiﬁcation from [5])

⊳F (X ⊲, Y ⊲, . . . , ) := F (X 1, Y 1, . . . , ) − F (X 0, Y 0, . . . , ),

(1.35)

where the symbols ⊲,1 ,0 and ⊳ are reserved for this purpose, and the underline is
to avoid confusion with exponents. The subspace and the projection orthogonal (in
the real sense) to ϕ ∈ S(R3) are denoted by

ϕ⊥ := {ψ ∈ S ′(R3) | hϕ|ψi = 0}, P ⊥

V ω(x) := ω−1/2SωV,

(1.39)

and the version without the potential

A := E0 + M = lim

Aω.

(1.40)

In this paper, most of the analysis will be done in the variables rescaled by Sω,
where the smallness of M corresponds to the largeness of ω. This is to avoid getting
large scaling factors in the estimates around the ﬁrst excited states, and to make
the formulations similar in the leading order to the case without the potential. Of
course, we still need to take care of the long-time impact of the potential and the
ground states, even if they are small in some sense.

1.5. Assumptions on the potential. In addition to the assumptions on V in [5],
we assume that V ∈ L2(R3). Hence the precise list of assumptions on V is

(i) V : R3 → R is radially symmetric.
(ii) V ∈ L2(R3) ∩ |x|L1(R3) and x∇V, x2∇2V ∈ (L2 + L∞
(iii) −∆ + V on L2
(iv) The wave operator lim
t→∞
some p > 6 and k = 0, 1,

r(R3) has a unique and negative eigenvalue, denoted by e0.

eitH eit∆ and its adjoint are bounded on H k

p (R3) for

0 )(R3).

where L∞

0 (R3) := {ϕ ∈ L∞(R3) |

R→∞kϕkL∞(|x|>R) = 0}. For example, if V0 is
lim
a radial positive Schwartz function on R3, then there exist b > a > 0 such that
V = −cV0 satisﬁes the above assumptions for a < c < b. See [5] for more comments.
V is ﬁxed throughout the paper, so that some “constants” can depend on V .

2. The first excited state and the linearized operator

In this section, we analyze the ﬁrst excited state for small mass and the spectrum

of the linearized operator around it.

2.1. Zero-mass asymptotic of energy. For any solution ϕ ∈ H 1
r of (1.4) with
M(ϕ) ≪ 1, we may apply the small mass dichotomy [5, Lemma 2.3], since K2(ϕ) =
hA′

2ϕi = 0. Then we have either kϕkH 1 ∼ kϕk2 ≪ 1 or

ω(ϕ)|S ′

G(ϕ) & H0(ϕ) & M(ϕ)−1 ≫ 1.

(2.1)

8

K. NAKANISHI

(2.2)

If M(ϕ) is small enough, then the former case implies that ϕ = Φ[z] for some z ∈ Z∗,
see [5, Propositions 2.4 and 2.5]. Hence we may concentrate on the latter case (2.1)
for excited states. Since V,S ′

pV ∈ L2 + L∞, we have [5, Lemma 2.1]

|⌈V ⌋(ϕ)| + |⌈S ′

pV ⌋(ϕ)| ≤ εpG(ϕ) + Cp,εM(ϕ),

for any ε, p > 0. Combining this, (2.1) and K2(ϕ) = 0 = K0,ω(ϕ), we obtain
approximate Pohozaev identities as µ := M(ϕ) → 0,

E(ϕ) = ωM(ϕ) + o(µ−1/2) =
G(ϕ) + o(µ−1/2) =

and so ω & µ−2. Then rescaling the solution by ϕω := Sωϕ = ω−1/2ϕ(ω−1/2x) leads
to the rescaled equation with time frequency 1

V ω(x) = ω−1V (ω−1/2x),

and rescaled functionals

Proof. The estimate on G in the case (2.9) follows by Gagliardo-Nirenberg. The left
side of (2.12) is bounded using (2.6) by

(β1/4 + β)H0(ϕ) . β1/4H0(ϕ),

(2.13)
where β := ω−1H0(ϕ)−1M(ϕ) ≤ CD(ω−1/2M(ϕ))2 < 1/CD. Thus we obtain (2.12).
r are all in the case (2.11), ϕn → ϕ weakly in H 1 and

M(ϕ)2 < ω−1/2,

(2.15)

contradicting (2.14), hence we have (2.11). The rest of the lemma follows simply by
rescaling [5, Lemma 2.3].

Now consider any sequence of (ϕ, ω) solving (1.4) such that µ := M(ϕ) → 0 and
ϕ 6∈ Φ[Z∗]. Then (2.5) implies that boundedness of the rescaled functions ϕω := Sωϕ
in L2(R3) is equivalent to boundedness in L4(R3), boundedness in ˙H 1(R3),

ω ∼ µ−1/2,

(2.16)

let
r (R3) be the weak limit along the subsequence. Then it solves the static

and weak convergence in H 1(R3) of ϕω along a subsequence.
ϕ∞ ∈ H 1
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation without the potential
(−∆ + 1)ϕ∞ = |ϕ∞|2ϕ∞,

In that case,

(2.17)

(2.18)

and the weak convergence implies that the limit energy satisﬁes

A(ϕ∞) ≤ lim inf A(ϕω) = lim inf ω−1/2Aω(ϕ) = lim inf 2pME(ϕ),

where the last two equalities follow from (2.5) and (2.3).

By the classical results on radial solutions of (2.17), all the solutions ψ are real-
valued (modulo complex rotation ψ 7→ eiθψ), satisfying E0(ψ) = M(ψ). The least
energy non-trivial solution is the unique positive solution, namely the ground state
Q. The other radial solutions have at least one zero point in r = |x| > 0, and those
ψ 6= 0 with m zeros have at least m + 1 times energy:

A(ψ) > (m + 1)A(Q) = 2(m + 1)M(Q) > 0.

(2.19)

The asymptotic (2.18) of energy implies that if (ϕ, ω) is a sequence of solutions
to (1.4) such that M(ϕ) → 0, ϕ 6∈ Φ[Z∗], and Aω(Sωϕ) ≤ 2A(Q), then we have
r (R3). The convergence
eiθϕ → Q for some sequence of θ ∈ R/2πZ, strongly in H 1
has to be strong, since otherwise

0 = 2(A − G)(Q) ≤ lim inf ω−1/2K0,ω(ϕ) = 0

(2.20)

would become a strict inequality. Thus we have obtained

Lemma 2.2. For any δ > 0, there exists µ(δ) > 0 such that if (ϕ, ω) ∈ H 1
satisﬁes the soliton equation (1.4) and

r × (0,∞)

M(ϕ) ≤ µ(δ), Aω(Sωϕ) ≤ 2A(Q),

then either ϕ ∈ Φ[Z∗] or

for some ω ∼ M(ϕ)−2 and θ ∈ R.

kSωϕ − eiθQkH 1 < δ

(2.21)

(2.22)

The ﬁrst excited states satisfy the above energy constraint [5, Proposition 2.5].
In the next subsection, we prove that they are indeed the only solitons satisfying
(2.22) for small mass. Then the above lemma implies the estimate on E2 in (1.15).

2.2. Construction of the ﬁrst excited state. The above lemma allows us to
expand the ﬁrst excited state in the rescaled variables around Q. For that purpose,
consider the linearized operators for (2.17) around Q

Lv := L+v1 + iL−v2, L+ := −∆ + 1 − 3Q2, L− := −∆ + 1 − Q2,

(2.23)
where v1 := Re v and v2 := Im v for any v ∈ S ′(R3). The null space of L on L2
equals to span{iQ}. L is invertible on the radial subspace orthogonal to iQ, and
L−1 is bounded H −1
r → H 1
r ∩ Q⊥ are bounded.
and (L−)−1 : H −1
r (R3) be a solution of (2.4) close to the ground states of

r ∩ (iQ)⊥. In other words, (L+)−1 : H −1

r ∩ (iQ)⊥ → H 1

(2.17), in other words

is small enough. Then there is a unique θ ∈ R/2πZ such that

ψ = eiθ(Q + v) =⇒ 0 = hiQ|vi = hiQ|e−iθψi,

(2.25)
Indeed, it is explicitly given by θ = arg(ψ|Q). Then (2.4) is rewritten into the
following equation for v:

kvkH 1 ∼ δ.

Lv = N(v) − V ω(Q + v), N(v) := 2Q|v|2 + Qv2 + |v|2v.

(2.26)

and, since v ⊥ iQ,

where the orthogonal projection P ⊥
Using Sobolev, H¨older and (2.6), we have

v = (L|(iQ)⊥)−1P ⊥

iQ(N(v) − V ω(Q + v)),

(2.27)
iQ : S ′ → (iQ)⊥ is bounded on H s for any s ∈ R.

Hence the right hand side of (2.27) is a contraction map for small v ∈ H 1
having a unique ﬁxed point v ∈ H 1

is a family of solutions to (1.4), smoothly depending on ω ≫ 1 with
r (R3).

v = −(L+)−1V ωQ + O(ω−1/2) = O(ω−1/4) in H 1

Denote the orbit of the rescaled soliton by

For the energy and mass, we deduce from (2.30)–(2.31)

Qω := {eiθQω | θ ∈ R}.

E1(M(Ψ[ω])) =E(Ψ[ω]) = ω1/2(E0(Q) + O(ω−1/4)),

M(Ψ[ω]) = ω−1/2(M(Q) + O(ω−1/4)).

Hence putting µ = M(Ψ[ω]), we obtain

(2.31)

(2.32)

(2.33)

ω = µ−2(M(Q)2 + O(µ1/2)),

E1(µ) = µ−1(ME0(Q) + O(µ1/2)).

(2.34)
Since the ground states Φ[Z∗] have smaller ω ∼ −e0, these solitons have the least
energy for ﬁxed ω ≫ 1. Hence they are also the constrained minimizers
r (R3), K0,ω(ϕ) = 0}.

Aω(Ψ[ω]) = inf{Aω(ϕ) | 0 6= ϕ ∈ H 1

(2.35)

In particular, Ψ[ω] > 0 on R3. For the analysis of dynamics, it is more important
to relate it to the virial identity or K2.
Lemma 2.3. There is a constant CM ∈ (1,∞) such that if ω ∈ (1,∞] is large
enough then we have the following for any ϕ ∈ H 1

r (R3).

(1) M(ϕ) < 2A(Q) and (2.9) =⇒ (M + ωH0)(ϕ) < CM .
(2) (2.11) =⇒ CSMH0(ϕ) ≥ 1 =⇒ (M + ωH0)(ϕ) > CM , where

CS := max(CD, 2 + (MH0(Q))−1).

(3) If (M+ωH0)(ϕ) ≤ CM then the solution u of (1.1) with u(0) = S−1
to Φ as t → ±∞, satisfying H0(Sωu(t)) < H0(Q)/4 for all t ∈ R.
(4) Qω = {eiθQω}θ is the set of minimizers of

(2.37)

(2.38)

The above choice (2.36) of the constant CS will be used later for scaling invariant

separation between the ground states and the excited states.
Proof. Since (2.9) and M(ϕ) < 2A(Q) imply (M + ωH0)(ϕ) ≤ (1 + CD)M(ϕ) <
2(1 + CD)A(Q), taking CM ≥ 2(1 + CD)A(Q) yields (1). (2) follows from

2√MH0 ≤ ω−1/2(M + ωH0),

and taking ω so large that ω−1/2CM < 2C −1/2
of kS−1
stability [2] of the ground states in H 1.

. A similar condition yields (3), because
H 1 = 2ω−1/2(M + ωH0)(ϕ), H0(Sωu) = ω−1/2H0(u) and the asymptotic

S

If ω = ∞, then the constraint on M + ωH0 in (2.37) becomes trivial and (4)
is reduced to a well known statement for the NLS without potential. So we may
restrict (4) to the case ω < ∞ (though the argument is essentially the same).

K. NAKANISHI

For ω large enough, Qω satisﬁes all the constraints in (2.37). To show the equality
in (2.37), it suﬃces to show that Jω(ϕ) is bigger than the ﬁrst line of (2.37) for any
ϕ satisfying the constraints and Kω

2 (ϕ) < 0, since Jω = Aω − Kω
Suppose that Jω(ϕ) is close to the second inﬁmum and Kω

2 (ϕ) < 0. Then by

(2.7) < Jω(ϕ) we deduce that M(ϕ) < 2A(Q) < C −1
ωH0)(ϕ) > CM and (1) preclude (2.9), while Kω
have (2.11) by Lemma 2.1.

Consider the L2-invariant scaling v(t) := S t

2ϕ, starting from t = 0 and decreasing.
As long as Kω
2 (v(t)) ≤ 0, Lemma 2.1 applies to v(t), and (1)-(2) with the continuity
of v in t imply that v(t) stays in the case (2.11). Meanwhile, we have, using (2.12),

Jω(v) = 3G(v) − ⌈S ′

Hence at some t < 0, we have Jω(v(t)) < Jω(ϕ), Kω
(M + ωH0)(v(t)) > CM by (2). This implies the equality in (2.37).

2 (v(t)) = 0 and (2.11) for v(t), so

Next we prove the existence of minimizer. Take any sequence ϕn ∈ H 1

r satisfying
2 (ϕn) = 0, (M + ωH0)(ϕn) > CM and Aω(ϕn) → (2.37). The same
ϕn 6= 0, Kω
argument as above implies that ϕn is in the case of (2.11). Passing to a subsequence,
we have ϕn → ∃ϕ weakly in H 1
2 (ϕ) ≤ 0, Jω(ϕ) ≤ (2.37), and by Lemma
2.1, ϕ also satisﬁes (2.11), so (M + ωH0)(ϕ) > CM by (2). Hence ϕ is a minimizer
of the second line of (2.37).

For any minimizer ϕ of (2.37), there is a Lagrange multiplier µ ∈ R such that

that ϕ ∈ Qω if ω is large enough.

2.3. Rescaled linearization and spectrum. Next we consider the linearization
of (1.1) around the ﬁrst excited soliton in the rescaled variables. Let

where Qω is the rescaled excited state as in (2.30). The linearized operator for the
evolution is given by iLω in the rescaled variables. The asymptotics (2.30)–(2.31)
of Ψ[ω] together with the smallness (2.6) of V ω implies

Lω = L + O(ω−1/4) in B(H 1, H −1).

The gauge invariance for eiθ× implies the trivial null direction

iLωiQω = 0.

(2.42)

(2.43)

Another direction comes from ω. Diﬀerentiating the equation (1.4) for Ψ[ω] yields

Next we look for a pair of positive and negative eigenvalues. In the limit ω → ∞,

as well as a similar estimate for the diﬀerence. Hence (2.60) has a unique ﬁxed point
γ ∈ H 1
Lemma 2.4. (iL− α) has a bounded inverse H −1 → H 1 on (ig−)⊥. More precisely,
for any h ∈ H −1(R3) ∩ (ig−)⊥, there exists a unique f ∈ H 1(R3) ∩ (ig−)⊥ such that
(iL − α)f = h, and moreover kfkH 1 . khkH −1.
Proof. First remark that Ker(iL∓ α) = span{g±} follows from the fact that L− ≥ 0
and L+ has only one negative eigenvalue. Indeed, if (iL − α)g = 0 for some g =
g1 + ig2 ∈ H 1(R3), then hL+g1|g1i = −hL−g2|g2i < 0 and g2 = L+g1/α, hence such a
function g should live in one dimensional subspace, because of the spectrum of L+.

The free operator iL0 − α := i(1 − ∆) − α is invertible

(iL0 − α)−1 = −[(1 − ∆)2 + |α|2]−1[i(1 − ∆) + α]

(2.62)
which can be written as a Fourier multiplier, and bounded H −1 → H 1. Moreover,
iL − α = (iL0 − α)(I + K), where the operator K is deﬁned by

and compact on H 1, hence Ran(I + K) = Ker(I + K ∗)⊥. Noting that

Kϕ := (iL0 − α)−1Q2(ϕ2 − 3iϕ1),

(iL − α)∗ = −Li − α = i(iL + α)i,

(2.63)

(2.64)

we have Ker(I + K ∗) = (iL0 − α)∗i Ker(iL + α) = span{(iL0 − α)∗ig−}, and so

Ran(I + K) = (iL0 − α)−1(H −1 ∩ (ig−)⊥).

(2.65)
Since g+ 6∈ X := H 1 ∩ (ig−)⊥, we have H 1 = X ⊕ span{g+}. This and Ker(I + K) =
span{g+} imply that I + K is bijective X → Ran(I + K). Hence the equation

3. Dynamics around the first excited state

3.1. Expansion around the excited state. For any solution u of (1.1) and any
ω > 0, consider the parabolic rescaling which preserves the equation and ˙H 1/2(R3)

uω(t, x) := Sωu(t/ω) = ω−1/2u(ω−1t, ω−1/2x).

Then (1.1) is rescaled to

(i∂t − ∆ + V ω)uω = |uω|2uω.

(3.1)

(3.2)

We say that a solution uω of (3.2) either blows up, scatters to Φ, or is trapped by Ψ,
if it happens for the unscaled solution u(t) := S−1

ω uω(ωt) (cf. Section 1.2).

Suppose that uω is close to the orbit of the excited state Qω at some t. More
precisely, assume uω(t) ∈ Nω or d0,ω(uω(t)) < δD for some ω ≥ ω∗ at some t ∈ R.
Here we could restrict ω by specifying the mass M(uω) = M(Qω) or equivalently
M(u) = M(Ψ[ω]) as in [7], but it is more convenient to keep the freedom of ω in
constructing the center-stable manifold (see Section 7).

Expanding the solution uω of (3.2) in the form

uω(t, x) = eiθ(t)(Qω(x) + v(t, x))

with θ(t) ∈ R/2πZ and v(t) ∈ H 1(R3) yields an equation for v
i ˙v = −Lωv + ( ˙θ + 1)(Qω + v) + N ω(v),
where N ω : H 1 → H −1 is the Fr´echet derivative of C ω given by

N ω(v) := 2Qω|v|2 + Qωv2 + |v|2v.

In the real value, the equation is written as

( ˙v1 = −Lω

˙v2 = Lω

3.2. Orthogonality and equations. In order to exploit the coercivity of Lω, we

0 = hiQ′

ω|vi = hiQ′

ω|e−iθuωi,

kvkH 1 ∼ d0,ω(uω).

3.3. Energy distance function. In view of the expansion (2.80), the linearized
energy norm kvkω is better suited than d0,ω to measure the distance from S1 to
solutions u. In order to avoid the regularity loss from the higher order term C ω, we
can either include it into the distance, or mollify the distance in time. Here we take
the latter option for a simpler (convex) dynamics of the (square) distance.

Fix a radial decreasing function χ ∈ C ∞

0 (R) satisfying

χ(t) =(1 |t| ≤ 1,

0 |t| ≥ 2.

(3.16)

For any ϕ ∈ Nω, let uω be the solution of (3.2) with uω(0) = ϕ. Decomposing
uω = eiθ(Qω + v) as above, a local distance function d1,ω is deﬁned at ϕ by

(3.17)

Lemma 3.1. There are constants δE ∈ (0, δD/2] and C ∈ [1,∞) such that for any
ω ≥ ω∗ and any ϕ ∈ H 1
r (R3) with d0,ω(ϕ) ≤ 2δE, the solution uω of (3.2) with the
initial condition uω(0) = ϕ exists at least for |t| ≤ 2, satisfying

|t| ≤ 2 =⇒ C −1d0,ω(uω(0)) ≤ d0,ω(uω(t)) ≤ Cd0,ω(uω(0)).

(3.18)

Hence d1,ω is well-deﬁned for d0,ω(ϕ) ≤ 2δE and uniformly equivalent to d0,ω.

Then a global distance function dω : H 1

r → [0,∞) is deﬁned by

dω(ϕ) := χ(d0,ω(ϕ)/δE)d1,ω(ϕ) + (1 − χ(d0,ω(ϕ)/δE))d0,ω(ϕ).

dω : H 1

r → [0,∞) satisﬁes dω(ϕ) ∼ d0,ω(ϕ) uniformly and

d0,ω(ϕ) ≤ δE =⇒ dω(ϕ) = d1,ω(ϕ).

(3.19)

(3.20)

3.4. Instability and ejection. The crucial property of the dynamics around S1
is that the rescaled solution uω can get away from Qω only by growing instability.
More precisely, we have

Lemma 3.2. There are constants cX ∈ (0, 1) and δI ∈ (0, δE] such that for any
ω ≥ ω∗ and any ϕ ∈ H 1

r (R3) we have uniformly

Aω(ϕ) − Aω(Qω) ≤ cXdω(ϕ)2

and dω(ϕ) ≤ δI) =⇒ dω(ϕ) = d1,ω(ϕ) ∼ |Bω

1 (ϕ)|.

(3.21)

Proof. Since dω ∼ d0,ω and (3.20), choosing δI small ensures that dω(ϕ) = d1,ω(ϕ)
for dω(ϕ) ≤ δI. Then by the deﬁnition of d1,ω and equivalence of distance functions,

using the equivalence (3.18) as well, and assuming if necessary that dω(uω) is even
smaller. The last equation implies the convexity of d2
1,ω, from which we deduce that
if uω satisﬁes at some time t = t0,

dω(uω) < δX , Aω(uω) − Aω(Qω) ≤ cXdω(uω)2,

(3.26)
for some small δX ≤ δI , then dω(uω) will keep growing for t ≥ t0 until the ﬁrst
condition is violated. dω(uω) ∼ |b1| implies that σ := sign b1(t) ∈ {±1} is ﬁxed
during that time.
Since 0 ≤ ∂tdω(uω) = ∂td1,ω(uω), the ﬁrst equation in (3.25) implies that b1b2(t1) &
−|b1(t1)|3 at some t1 ∈ (t0 − 2, t0 + 2), then (taking δX small), σb+(t1) ≥ |b1(t1)|/3
and σb−(t1) ≥ 0. Because ∂t(b1b2) ≥ 0 and b1 ∼ b1(t0) for |t − t0| < 2, we may
choose t1 > t0.

∂tdω(uω) ≥ 0,

Let R := |b1(t1)| and suppose that on some interval [t1, t2] we have (3.26) and

|b1| ≤ 2Reαω (t−t1).

Then the equations of b± in (3.14) imply

|b± − e±αω (t−t1)b±(t1)| . (Reαω(t−t1))2 . δXReαω (t−t1),

and so, taking δX smaller if necessary,

|b1| = σ(b+ + b−)(≤ Reαω(t−t1)(1 + CδX ) < 2Reαω(t−t1),

≥ Reαω(t−t1)(1/3 − CδX ) > Reαω (t−t1)/4.

Therefore t2 can be increased until dω(uω) reaches δX at some t = tX > t0, and for
t0 ≤ t ≤ tX, we have

dω(uω) ∼ σb1(t) ∼ σb1(t0)eαω(t−t0),

for a time-independent sign σ ∈ {±1}, while the equations of b± imply

b±(t) = e±αω(t−t0)b±(t0) + O(b2

on t0 ≤ t ≤ tX . Thus we have obtained the following.
Lemma 3.3 (Ejection Lemma). There are constants CK ∈ (0,∞) and δX ∈ (0, δI]
such that for any ω ≥ ω∗ and any solution uω of (3.2) satisfying the three conditions
in (3.26) at some t = t0 ∈ R, there exists tX ∈ (t0,∞) such that dω(uω(tX)) = δX ,
and for t0 < t < tX , dω(uω(t)) is strictly increasing,

Remark 3.4. In the previous papers such as [7], the sign was opposite between the
unstable mode and the virial functional. In this paper, the sign of the eigenmode
is chosen to match that of virial. In other words, the sign of eigenmode is ﬂipped
from [7], by the choice (normalization) of gω
±.

Note that by the time inversion symmetry, we can and will apply the above
lemma backward in time as well. As an immediate consequence, we can describe
the behavior of solutions which are not ejected. In contrast to the ejected solutions,
they are monotonically and exponentially attracted by a small neighborhood of Qω.
Lemma 3.5 (Trapping Lemma). Let ω ≥ ω∗ and uω be a solution of (3.2) on some
interval [t0,∞) satisfying

sup

dω(uω(t)) < δX.

t0<t<∞

(3.40)

(3.41)

(3.42)

Then there exists t1 ∈ [t0,∞] such that dω(uω(t)) is strictly decreasing on [t0, t1) and

(t0 ≤ t < t1 =⇒ dω(uω(t)) ∼ e−αω(t−t0)dω(uω(t0)),

t1 < t < ∞ =⇒ cX dω(uω(t))2 < Aω(uω) − Aω(Qω).

We have t1 = ∞ if and only if uω(t) converges to ei(a−t)Qω strongly in H 1(R3) as
t → ∞ for some a ∈ R. Moreover, in that case we have

kuω(t) − ei(a−t)QωkH 1 ∼ e−αω(t−t0)dω(uω(t0)).

Proof. Abbreviate d(t) := dω(uω(t)). The ejection lemma 3.3 implies that if (3.26)
holds at any t ∈ [t0,∞) then d(t) grows at least to δX , violating the ﬁrst condition
of (3.40). Since d(t) < δX for all t ≥ t0, the latter two conditions of (3.26) should
never hold, in other words

∂td(t) < 0

or

cX d(t)2 < Aω(uω) − Aω(Qω).

(3.43)

22

K. NAKANISHI

Then t1 := inf{t ≥ t0 | cXd(t)2 < Aω(uω)− Aω(Qω)} satisﬁes the desired properties.
The exponential decay follows from Lemma 3.3 applied backward in time

d(t0) ∼ eαω (t0−t)d(t)

(3.44)
If t1 = ∞ then d(t) ∼ e−αω(t−t0)d(t0) → 0 as t → ∞, hence
for t0 < t < t1.
exponential convergence to the set Qω. Conversely, if uω is strongly convergent,
then Aω(uω) = Aω(Qω), which forces t1 = ∞. Then the modulation equation (3.9)
yields | ˙θ + 1| . kvkH 1 . e−αω(t−t0)δ, and by integration in t, the same bound for
|θ − (a − t)| for some a ∈ R.
(cid:3)
Under an energy constraint Aω(uω) < Aω(Qω) + cXδ2 for some δ ∈ (0, δX), every

solution uω satisfying (3.40) comes closer to Qω, namely

t1 < t < ∞ =⇒ dω(uω(t)) < δ < δX .

(3.45)

This distance gap between the ejection and the trapping is a key property of the
instability dynamics.

4. Static analysis away from the first excited state

When the solution is away from the ﬁrst excited states, the above linearization is

useless. Instead, we rely on energy-type, variational and topological arguments.

4.1. Variational estimate away from the solitons. We have sign-deﬁniteness
of the virial Kω

2 away from the solitons.

Lemma 4.1. There exist continuous, positive and increasing functions εV and κV
r (R3) satisfy
from (0,∞) to (0, 1) with the following property. Let ω ≥ ω∗ and ϕ ∈ H 1
the following three conditions:

dω(ϕ) ≥ δ, Aω(ϕ) < Aω(Qω) + εV (δ)2, M + ωH0(ϕ) > CM .

(4.1)

Then we have one of the following (a)-(b).

2 (ϕ)| ≥ κV (δ).

(a) |Kω
(b) H0(ϕ) ≤ CDKω

2 (ϕ) ≤ C 2

D
δU := inf
ω≥ω∗

H0(ϕ) and Eω(ϕ) < δU /2, where

Eω(Qω) > 0.

(4.2)

Note that the ﬁrst and the third conditions in (4.1) are to avoid the sign change
of Kω
2 respectively around the ﬁrst excited state and around the ground state, but
we can not avoid the vanishing at 0, namely k∇ϕk2 → 0 as ω → ∞, corresponding
to the case (b). δU > 0 is ensured by (2.84).

Proof. We argue by contradiction. Let (ϕ, ω) = (ϕn, ωn) be a sequence in H 1
[ω∗,∞) such that as n → ∞,
dω(ϕ) ≥ δ, Aω(ϕ) < Aω(Qω) + o(1),
2 (ϕ) → 0, (4.3)
and that ϕ does not satisfy (b). Combining the above with (2.7), (2.83) and (2.84)
yields

for large n, so that we can extract a subsequence such that ω converges to some
r and strongly in L4.
̟ ∈ [ω∗,∞] and that ϕ converges to some ϕ∞ weakly in H 1
The convergence implies

J̟(ϕ∞) ≤ J̟(Q̟), K̟

2 (ϕ∞) ≤ 0.

(4.5)

Apply Lemma 2.1 to ϕ. Lemma 2.3 (1) with (4.4) precludes the case (2.9). Since
(2.10) with Kω
2 (ϕ) → 0 would lead to (b) for large n, we deduce that ϕ is in the case
(2.11), so is the weak limit ϕ∞. Then Lemma 2.3 implies that ϕ∞ = eiθQ̟ for some
θ ∈ R, and so Aω(ϕ) → A̟(ϕ∞), which implies that the convergence ϕ → eiθQ̟ is
strong in H 1, contradicting dω(ϕ) ≥ δ.
(cid:3)
4.2. Sign functional. Combining the above Lemmas 3.3 and 4.1, we see that the
sign σ in (3.39) can be given by a functional on two separate open sets in H 1
r away
from Qω. More precisely, we have
Lemma 4.2. There exist constants δV ∈ (0, δX/2) and εS ∈ (0, εV (δV )) such that
for each ω ≥ ω∗ there exists a unique continuous functional
Sω : {ϕ ∈ H 1
satisfying (i)–(iii) below. For any ϕ ∈ ˇHω and θ ∈ R,

r (R3) | Aω(ϕ) − Aω(Qω) < min(ε2

(i) If CSMH0(ϕ) ≤ 1 then Sω(ϕ) = +1.
(ii) If dω(ϕ) < 2δV then Sω(ϕ) = sign Bω
(iii) If Aω(ϕ) − Aω(Qω) < εV (dω(ϕ))2 and (M + ωH0)(ϕ) > CM , then Sω(ϕ) =
Moreover, if ϕ ∈ H 1

r (R3) satisﬁes Sωj ϕ ∈ ˇHωj for some ω 0, ω 1 ≥ ω∗, then

Sω0(Sω0ϕ) = Sω1(Sω1ϕ).

If Aω(ϕ) < Aω(Qω) + ε2

(4.7)
S and dω(ϕ) > δV , then Aω(ϕ) − Aω(Qω) < εV (δV )2 <
εV (dω(ϕ))2. If (M + ωH0)(ϕ) ≤ CM then CSMH0(ϕ) ≤ 1 by Lemma 2.3(2). Hence
(i)-(iii) determine the value of Sω on ˇHω, which is independent of the choice of δV
and εS (because (i) and (iii) are independent). The continuity of Sω simply means
that it is constant on each connected component of ˇHω. The last sentence of lemma
allows us to deﬁne a functional independent of ω

S : ˇH → {±1}, S(ϕ) := Sω(Sωϕ),

ˇH := {ϕ ∈ H 1

r (R3) | ∃ω > ω∗, Sωϕ ∈ ˇHω}.

As a suﬃcient condition for ϕ ∈ ˇH, using inf ω>0 Aω(Sωϕ) = 2pE(ϕ)M(ϕ) and
r (R3) belongs to ˇH if

we see that there exist 0 < µ, ε, c ≪ 1 such that ϕ ∈ H 1

dω(Sωϕ) ∼ distH 1(Sωϕ,Qω) & dist ˙H 1/2(ϕ,{eiθΨ[ω]}θ),

M(ϕ) < µ and E(ϕ)M(ϕ) < E0(Q)M(Q) + min(ε2, c dist ˙H 1/2(ϕ, S1)).
Notice that σ in the ejection lemma 3.3 is not necessarily equal to Sω(uω(tX)),
but it is so if the solution is well accelerated at the ejection time tX, that is the
case if dω(uω(t0)) ≪ δX . In any case, the sign functional Sω will give the correct
prediction of dynamics after the ejection. It is also worth noting

ω ({+1}) is uniformly bounded in H 1 for ω ≥ ω∗.

Proof. It is obvious in the case (ii) of Lemma 4.2, because Qω is bounded.
In
the case (iii), the uniform bound follows from (2.7) and Kω
2 (ϕ) ≥ 0. In the case
(i), using (2.36) and that Q attains the best constant in Gagliardo-Nirenberg G .
(MH0)1/2H0, we obtain

where we also used the Pohozaev identity, cf. (2.3). Using (2.83) as well, we obtain

M(ϕ).

(4.12)

Since the cases (i)-(iii) exhaust the region ˇHω as seen above, we conclude that
S−1
ω ({+1}) is uniformly bounded.
Proof of Lemma 4.2. Fix 0 < δV ≪ δX and εS ∈ (0, εV (δV )). To show that Sω is
uniquely, continuously and well deﬁned by (i)-(iii), it suﬃces to show that (i), (ii)
and (iii) do not contradict in the intersections.

(cid:3)

There is no intersection of (i) and (ii) because of (2.36) and (2.84), if δV > 0 is
small enough. Choosing εS small enough and using (4.12), ϕ ∈ ˇHω and (2.84), we
have

(i) =⇒ M(ϕ) <

(Aω(Qω) + ε2

S) < 2A(Q).

(4.13)

2 (ϕ) > 0.

Hence in the intersection of (i) and (iii), Lemma 2.3 (1)-(2) precludes (2.9) and
(2.11), then (2.10) implies Kω

For the intersection of (ii) and (iii), let ϕ ∈ ˇHω satisfy Aω(ϕ) < Aω(Qω) +
εV (dω(ϕ)) and dω(ϕ) < 2δV . Let uω be the solution of (3.2) with uω(0) = ϕ. Since
ϕ satisﬁes (3.21), the ejection lemma 3.3 is applied to uω, either forward or backward
in time from t = 0. In both cases, there exists tX ∈ R such that dω(uω) ∈ (dω(ϕ), δX)
is monotone between t = 0 and tX , with dω(uω(tX )) = δX . Since dω(ϕ) < 2δV ≪ δX,
2 (uω(tX)) = sign b1(0). Since Aω(uω) − Aω(Qω) <
(3.39) implies that σ = sign Kω
εV (dω(ϕ))2 ≤ εV (uω)2 between t = 0 and tX, the variational lemma 4.1 implies
that sign Kω
2 (uω) also remains unchanged. Note that the case (b) of Lemma 4.1 is
precluded by dω(ϕ) < δV , since it implies Eω(ϕ) > Eω(Qω)/2 ≥ δU /2 if δV is small
enough. Hence sign Kω
2 (uω) = sign b1(0), so (ii) and (iii) deﬁne the same value of Sω
for ϕ. Therefore Sω is well deﬁned and continuous.
r (R3) satisfy Sωj ϕ ∈ ˇHωj . Let
u be the solution of (1.1) with u(0) = ϕ and let uj := Sωj u. Then uj(t/ωj) is the
solution of (3.2) with uj(0) = Sωj ϕ and ω = ωj.
Suppose that Sω0(u0(0)) 6= Sω1(u1(0)) and let I ∋ 0 be the maximal time interval
where uj remains in ˇHωj for both j = 0 and j = 1. The discrepancy of Sω implies
that either u0(t) or u1(t) is in the case (ii) at each t ∈ I, since MH0(Sωϕ) and
Kω
2 (Sωϕ) = K2(ϕ) are independent of ω. Suppose that u0(0) is in the case (ii).
By the ejection lemma as above, u0 exits (ii) into the region (iii) either forward or
backward in time. Meanwhile, u1 must either enter the region (ii) or exit ˇHω1. Since
the solution does not blow up, exiting ˇHω1 is possible only through the region (ii).

To show the invariance with respect to ω, let ϕ ∈ H 1

Since {t ∈ I | (ii)} is open for each solution, we deduce that at some t = t0 ∈ I both

which is a contradiction, if δV is small enough. Therefore Sω is invariant for ω. (cid:3)

5. One-pass lemma

Now we are ready to prove the key dynamical property that any solution can not
pass closely by the ﬁrst excited states more than once. In the proof below in the
region Sω = +1, we will use the results and the arguments in [5], which requires
smallness of M(u), or equivalently largeness of ω. To be precise about it, we have
Lemma 5.1. There is a constant ω⋆ ∈ [ω∗,∞) such that for any ω ≥ ω⋆, every
ϕ ∈ S−1
ω ({+1}) satisﬁes all the small-mass conditions in [5]. Speciﬁcally, using the
constants µ∗ in Lemma 2.6 and µp, µ⋆ in [5, Theorems 1.1 and 7.1], we have

M(S−1

ω ϕ) < min(µ∗, µp, µ⋆).

(5.1)

Proof. Immediate from Lemma 4.3 and M(S−1
Lemma 5.2. There is a constant δ∗ ∈ (0, min(δX, c−1/2
X εS)] such that if uω is a so-
lution of (3.2) for some ω ≥ ω⋆ on a maximal existence interval (T−, T+), satisfying
(5.2)

dω(uω(t1)) < δ, Aω(uω) < Aω(Qω) + cXδ2,

ω ϕ) = ω−1/2M(ϕ).

(cid:3)

for some δ ∈ (0, δ∗] at some t1 ∈ (T−, T+), then there exists t2 ∈ (t1, T+] such that
dω(uω(t)) < δ for t1 ≤ t < t2 and dω(uω(t)) > δ for t2 < t < T+. If t2 = T+, then
the trapping lemma 3.5 applies to uω.

26

K. NAKANISHI

The rest of this section is devoted to proving the above lemma. The solution uω
of (3.2) is ﬁxed, so that we can abbreviate d(t) := dω(uω), but all estimates will be
uniform with no dependence on the particular choice of uω.

The last sentence of the lemma is obvious from δ ≤ δ∗ ≤ δX. For a proof of
the rest and main part of the lemma, it suﬃces to derive a contradiction from the
following: Suppose that for some t− < t+ within (T−, T+),

max

t∈[t−,t+]

d(t) > min

t∈[t−,t+]

d(t) = d(t±) =: δ ∈ (0, δ∗].

(5.3)

Taking δ∗ ≤ c−1/2

X εS ensures that uω(t) stays in ˇHω for t ∈ [t−, t+], because

Aω(uω) − Aω(Qω) < cXδ2 ≤ cXδ2

∗ ≤ ε2
S.
Hence σ := Sω(uω(t)) ∈ {±1} is independent of t ∈ [t−, t+].
Taking δ∗ ≪ δV , decompose the time interval [t−, t+] as follows. Let M be the
set of all minimal points of d : [t−, t+] → [δ,∞) with the minima less than δV . Then
applying the ejection lemma 3.3 from each t0 ∈ M forward and backward in time,
we obtain a closed interval I(t0) ⊂ [t−, t+] such that d(t)2 is strictly convex on I(t0)
with the unique minimal point t = t0 with d(t) = δX on ∂I(t0) \ {t±}, and

(5.4)

eαω|t−t0|d(t0) ∼ d(t) ∼ σb1(t) ∼ σKω

2 (uω(t)) + CKkζ(t0)kH 1

(5.5)

on I(t0). The convexity on each I(t0) implies that those intervals are mutually
disjoint. Putting

IH := [t0∈M

I(t0),

IV := [t−, t+] \ IH,

(5.6)

we have d ∈ [δ, δX] on IH and d ∈ [δV ,∞) on IV . Lemma 2.3 (3) implies that
(M+ωH0)(uω) > CM on [t−, t+], since otherwise H0(uω(t±)) < H0(Q)/4 < H0(Qω)/2
contradicts that d(t±) ≤ δ∗ ≪ 1. Then the variational lemma 4.1 implies

t ∈ IV =⇒ σKω

2 (uω) ≥ κV (δV ) > 0.

Note that the case (b) of Lemma 4.1 is also precluded by the proximity to Qω, which
implies Eω(uω) > Eω(Qω)/2 ≥ δU /2.
5.1. Blow-up region. For σ = −1, we use a localized virial as in [7, §4.1], [8]

Vm(t) := hmφmuω|i∂ruωi,

where φ(r) is a smooth non-decreasing function satisfying

φ(r) =(r

(r ≤ 1)
3/2 (r ≥ 2),

(5.7)

(5.8)

(5.9)

and φm(r) = φ(r/m) for some cut-oﬀ radius m > 1 to be chosen shortly. Using the
equation (3.2), we have

˙Vm = 2Kω

f0 := 1 − φr,

f1 := −r2∆(∂r/2 + 1/r)φ,

f2 := 3/2 − (∂r/2 + 1/r)φ.

The last term in (5.10) is the only essential diﬀerence from the case [7] without the
potential. Since S ′

The same estimate applies to the second last term of (5.10), because |f2,m| . f0,m.
The norm k∂ruωkL2(f0,mdx) can be absorbed by the second term on the right of (5.10)

Hence, choosing η small and then m large such that

we have ˙Vm ≤ −κV (δV ) < 0 on IV . On each I(t0) in IH, we have

kuωkL2(|x|>m) ≤ kQωkL2(|x|>m) + kvkL2(|x|>m) . m−1 + d(t),

which is a contradiction. Therefore (5.3) is impossible in the case σ = −1.
5.2. Scattering region. For σ = +1, we could argue as in [7], which would how-
ever suﬀer from the loss of sign in the localized virial due to the potential or the
ground states, which happens as the solution is expected to be very dispersed in
the variational time IV . Speciﬁcally, the argument would fail at [7, (4.31)]. Then
one option to overcome it would be to estimate possible dispersion and propaga-
tion along any returning orbit so that we can ﬁnd an appropriate cut-oﬀ radius m.
Instead of that, we rely on the minimal contradiction argument of Kenig-Merle [4]
using the proﬁle decomposition in [5], to show that there is a positive lower bound
on δ for which the return path (5.3) can exist.

Let ωn ≥ ω⋆ be a sequence such that ωn → ̟ ∈ [ω⋆,∞] and leteun be a sequence
δX ≫ δ = δn → 0, Sωn(eun(t±,n)) = +1.
After appropriate translation of each eun in time, there exist sequences eRn < 0 <
eSn < eTn such that, abbreviating dn(t) := dωn(eun(t)) and αn := αωn,
dn(eRn) = δn = dn(eTn),
dn(0) = δX = dn(eSn),
eRn ≤ t ≤ 0 =⇒ dn(t) ∼ eαntδX,
eRn < t < eTn =⇒ dn(t) > δn,
eSn ≤ t ≤ eTn =⇒ dn(t) ∼ e−αn(t− eSn)δX .

Sinceeun stays in ˇHωn with Sωn = +1, by Lemma 4.3 it is uniformly bounded in H 1
on [eRn,eTn]. Let un := S−1

(5.24)
Since ωn ≥ ω⋆, Lemma 5.1 allows us to apply the arguments in [5] to un. Using the
coordinate around the ground solitons as in [5, (4.9)], we can decompose

ωneun(ωnt) be the sequence of unscaled solutions, and

(Rn, Sn, Tn) := ω−1

(5.23)

un(t) = Φ[zn(t)] + ηn(t) = Φ[zn(t)] + R[zn(t)]ξn(t)

(5.25)

such that ηn(t) ∈ Hc[zn(t)] and ξn(t) ∈ Pc(H 1

r ) for t ∈ [Rn, Tn], where

Hc[z] := {ϕ ∈ H 1

r | 0 = hiϕ|∂zΦ[z]i = hiϕ|∂zΦ[z]i}, R[z] = (Pc|Hc[z])−1.

Let C6 > 0 be the best constant such that inf θ keiθQω − ϕk6 ≤ C6dω(ϕ) holds for all

δW := inf{keiθQω − SωΦ[z]k6/C6 | ω ≥ ω∗, θ ∈ R, z ∈ Z∗}.

(5.27)
Then δW > 0 because both {eiθQω}ω≥ω∗,θ∈R and {SωΦ[z]}z∈Z∗ are precompact in H 1
and the normand is never 0 even on their closures. Hence for large n, there exists

because of the exponential behavior on [Sn, Tn] in (5.23). Similarly we have eRn .
− log(δX /δn) → −∞ and eTn & log(δX/δn) → ∞. Since eun are uniformly bounded
in C([eRn,eTn]; H 1
a subsequence, eun converges to someeu∞ in C(R; w- H 1
The weak convergence implies E̟(eu∞) ≤ E̟(Q̟) and M(eu∞) ≤ M(Q), as well
as d̟(eu∞(t)) . eα̟ tδX for all t < 0, hence by the conservation law
(M, E̟)(eu∞) = (M, E̟)(Q̟).
Therefore the convergence eun →eu∞ is strong in H 1, locally uniformly in t.

5.2.1. The case of bounded time frequency ̟ < ∞. In this case, the above strong
convergence is translated to that of un to u∞(t) := S−1
decomposition in [5, §5–7] to ξn on [0, Tn]. Then the strong convergence of un(0)
implies that there is only one nonlinear proﬁle, which is the strong limit at t = 0,
and the remainder is strongly vanishing in H 1. Hence [5, Theorem 7.2] and (5.28)
imply that u∞ does not scatter to Φ as t → ∞.
Then the main result of [5] below S1 together with (5.29) implies that u∞ is a
minimal non-scattering solution, so the argument in [5, §8] implies that u∞(0,∞) ⊂
H 1 is precompact. Since

(5.29)

d∞(t) := d̟(eu∞(t))

ei(a−t)Q̟ +o(1) in H 1 as t → −∞ for some a ∈ R. In particular, the entire trajectory

is exponentially decaying as t → −∞, the trapping lemma 3.5 implies thateu∞(t) =
eu∞(R) is precompact in H 1.

Now we use another localized virial identity as in [7, §4.2]

Vm := hψmeu∞|iS ′

then t+ > t− because ∂td∞(t−) > 0 by the ejection lemma 3.3. Suppose that t+ < ∞
for contradiction. Decompose [t−, t+] = IH ∪ IV as in (5.6). Using the exponential
decay of Q̟, we have on each I(t0)

eu∞ is a global solution of (1.9) exponentially convergent to {eiθQ}θ as t → −∞.
Then the classiﬁcation by [1] implies that eu∞ is, modulo time translation, either
t = 0 implies d∞(eu∞(0)) = δX > 0, precluding the soliton case. Hence eu∞ = w+.
If eSn converges to some ﬁnite eS∞ < ∞ along a subsequence, then d∞(eu∞(t)) .
e−α(t− eS∞)δX for t ≥ eS∞, contradicting the scattering to 0 of eu∞ as t → ∞. Hence

V ∈ L2(R3) is a suﬃcient condition, as shown above by the Strichartz perturbation,
but the latter does not work if we merely assume V ∈ L2 + L∞

6. Dynamics away from the excited states

The one-pass lemma 5.2 ensures that if a solution of the rescaled NLS (3.2) leaves
the small neighborhood of Qω, then it never returns. In this section, we investigate
behavior of such solutions uω staying away from Qω, after some time or for all time.
More precisely, let uω be any solution of (3.2) for some ω ≥ ω⋆ satisfying

Aω(uω) ≤ Aω(Qω) + cXδ2
∗,

inf

0≤t<T+

dω(uω(t)) ≥ δ∗,

(6.1)

where T+ ∈ (0,∞] is the maximal existence time of uω. Thanks to (5.4), we have
the same decomposition of [0, T+) = IH ∪ IV as in (5.6) with δ = δ∗, and the sign
σ := Sω(uω(t)) ∈ {±1} remains constant for t ∈ [0, T+), which distinguishes the
scattering and the blow-up cases.

6.1. Blow-up region. In the case σ = −1, the solution blows up.
Lemma 6.1. For every ω ≥ ω∗ and every solution uω of (3.2) satisfying

as [7, §4.1] in the case without the potential, because the region Sω = −1 is away
from the ground states, where Kω
Also note that ω ≥ ω∗ is enough in this region, since the proﬁle decomposition in
[5] is not needed. In fact, the region of uω(0) in the above lemma is unbounded in
L2(R3), though it is not essentially new compared with [5], since those initial data
with large L2 need very negative energy E to satisfy (6.2), for which proving the
blow-up is easier.

2 degenerates. The detail is omitted.

6.2. Scattering region. In the case σ = +1, uω scatters to Φ as t → ∞. The
global existence is immediate from the H 1 bound of Lemma 4.3, so the main part is
to prove the scattering. As in [7], it is done by using the proﬁle decomposition. In
the same way as in the previous section, we need to distinguish between the case of
bounded ω and the case of ω → ∞.
For each ω ≥ ω⋆ and A ≤ cX δ2

t≥0

dω(uω(t)) ≥ δ∗,

(6.3)

where uω(t) := Sωu(t/ω) is the rescaled solution of (3.2). In the original scale, the
ﬁrst condition is equivalent to, putting µ := M(Ψ[ω]),

Aω(u) ≤ E1(µ) + ωµ + ω1/2A = ω1/2(A(Q) + A + O(ω−1/4)).

(6.4)
Now we look for a minimal solution in FSω(A)\S. Note that (6.3) with A ≤ cXδ2
implies that uω = Sωu(t/ω) stays in ˇHω for all t ≥ 0, and the case S = −1 is
precluded by the blow-up Lemma 6.1. Hence Lemma 5.1 with ω ≥ ω⋆ allows us to
apply the arguments in [5] to any solution u in FSω(A). Using the decomposition
u(t) = Φ[z(t)] + R[z(t)]ξ(t) of [5, Lemma 4.1], let

Therefore u(tn) = un(0) should be strongly convergent (along a subsequence),
which means that {u(t)}t≥0 is precompact. Then the same virial argument as in
Section 5.2.1 leads to a contradiction, so the case ̟ < ∞ is precluded. Note that in
using the variational lemma 4.1, we can eliminate the cases (M + ωH0)(uω) ≤ CM

using the proximity to Qω as in Section 5.2.1).

t ∈ [0, T+). Moreover, Lemmas 6.1 and 6.2 imply

Sω(uω(0)) =(+1 =⇒ uω scatters to Φ as t → ∞,

−1 =⇒ uω blows up in t > 0.

(6.64)

If inf 0≤t<T+ d(t) < δ∗, then the one-pass lemma 5.2 implies that d(t) < δ∗ on

t ∈ (t1, t2) and d(t) > δ∗ on t ∈ (t2, T+), for t1, t2 ∈ [0, T+] deﬁned by

t1 := inf{t ∈ [0, T+) | d(t) < δ∗},

t2 := sup{t ∈ [0, T+) | d(t) < δ∗}.

(6.65)

If t1 > 0, then applying the ejection lemma 3.3 from t = t1 backward, there exists

t0 < t1 such that d(t) is strictly and exponentially decreasing on [t0, t1] with

d(t) ∼ e−αω(t−t0)δX ∼ e−αω(t1−t)δ∗,

d(t0) = δX > d(t1) = δ∗.

(6.66)

If t2 < T+, then we have the same dichotomy as in (6.64) at t = t2.
If t2 = T+, then the uniform bound d(t) ≤ δ∗ for t ≥ t1 implies t2 = T+ = ∞, and
by the trapping lemma 3.5, there exists t3 ∈ [t1,∞] such that d(t) is strictly and
exponentially decreasing on [t1, t3) with

(t1 ≤ t < t3 =⇒ d(t) ∼ e−αω(t−t1)δ∗,

t3 < t < ∞ =⇒ cXd(t)2 < Aω(uω) − Aω(Qω).

(6.67)

This implies that u(t) ∈ Nδ for large t and for some δ ∼ (c∗/cX)1/2δ∗, so u is
trapped by Ψ as t → ∞. We have t3 = ∞ if and only if u(t) is strongly convergent
to e−iω(t−a)Ψ[ω] in H 1

r as t → ∞ for some a ∈ R.

Now that we have proven the classiﬁcation part of the main Theorem 1.1, together
with some description of each behavior, it remains to see for which initial data each
of the possibilities occurs, especially for the trapping and the transition.

7. Center-stable manifold of the excited solitons

In this section, we show that the set of initial data for which the solution is
trapped by Ψ is a C 1 manifold of codimension 1, and that it is a threshold between
the scattering to Φ and the blow-up. It is a center-stable manifold of S1|M≪1, its
time inversion is a center-unstable manifold, and there are all the 9 types of solutions
around the transversal intersection of them.

7.1. Construction around the excited states. First we construct a manifold
around a ﬁxed excited soliton e−itQω by the bisection argument as a graph of
(b−(0), ζ(0)) 7→ b+(0) in the decomposition (2.71).
+)/(cXδ2
Theorem 7.1. Take δ± ∈ (0, δX) such that δ−/δ+, δ+/δX and (δ−δ+ + δ3

are all small enough. Then a unique C 1 function Gω is deﬁned for each ω ≥ ω∗ on
(7.1)

Uω := {(b−, ζ) ∈ R × Zω | max(|b−|,kζkω) < δ−},

such that for any

(θ, b+, b−, ζ) ∈ Uω := (R/2πZ) × (−δ+, δ+) × Uω,

(7.2)

the solution of (3.2) with the initial condition uω(0) = Cω(θ, b+, b−, ζ) satisﬁes

(1) If b+ = Gω(b−, ζ) then dω(uω(t)) < δX /2 for all t ≥ 0.
(2) If b+ 6= Gω(b−, ζ) then dω(uω(t)) reaches δX at some tX > 0, where

Bω

1 (uω(tX)) ∼ sign(b+ − Gω(b−, ζ))δX.

(7.3)

Moreover, we have |Gω(b−, ζ)| . |b−|2 + kζk2

The above characterization (1)-(2) implies that the value of Gω is independent
of the choice of δ±. The distance upper bound δX /2 in the case (1) is chosen just
for distinction from the case (2), but it can be made arbitrarily small by taking δ±
smaller.

7.1.1. Existence of Gω. First, we prove the existence of a value of b+ for which uω
is trapped. Fix δ± such that 0 < δ− ≪ δ+ ≪ δX and δ−δ+ + δ3
X . Take
any (b−, ζ) ∈ Uω. Since dω(uω(0)) . δ+ ≪ δX , if dω(uω(t)) reaches δX at some
t = tX > 0, then the ejection lemma 3.3 implies |b1(tX )| ∼ δX. Let B± be the sets
of such b+ ∈ (−δ+, δ+) that b1(tX) ∼ ±δX at the ﬁrst ejection time in t > 0.
ω as
long as dω(u′

by deﬁnition. Both sets are non-empty, because for |b+| ≫ |b−| + kζkω, (2.74) and
(3.25) imply that the ejection condition (3.26) is satisﬁed at t = 0, then sign b1(t) =
sign b+(t) is preserved until dω(uω(t)) reaches δX.

B± are open, because the ejection lemma applies to perturbed solutions u′

ω(tX )) ∼ δX ≫ dω(u′

+ ≪ cXδ2

Hence by the connectedness, (−δ+, δ+) \ (B+ ∪ B−) is not empty either. If b+ is
in this set, then by deﬁnition of B±, we have dω(uω(t)) < δX for all t ≥ 0, and so

7.1.2. Lipschitz estimate. Next we prove a key Lipschitz estimate for a generalized
diﬀerence equation of (3.12) for trapped solutions, which will imply the uniqueness
and Lipschitz continuity of Gω.

Before taking the diﬀerence, we prepare time-local bound on the Strichartz norm.
Let v be a solution of (3.12) on an interval I. Applying the Strichartz estimate of
e−it∆ to the equation of v, we deduce that there exists a small constant δS ∈ (0, 1)
such that

kvkL∞

t H 1(I) ≤ δS and |I| ≤ 1 =⇒ kvkStz1(I) . kvkL∞

t H 1(I).

In particular, denoting

we have

ul(0,∞) . kvkL∞

t H 1(0,∞).

(7.6)

(7.7)

(7.8)

Now let v0, v1 be two solutions of (3.12), and let ~v := (v0, v1). Then the diﬀerence

⊳v⊲ = v1 − v0 satisﬁes

(∂t − iLω)⊳v⊲ = −iQω⊳mω(v⊲) + ⊳N ω(v⊲) = [−iQω ´mω(~v) + ´N ω(~v)]⊳v⊲,

(7.9)

where ´mω(~v) and ´N ω(~v) are operators deﬁned by the following:
X(v) which is Fr´echet diﬀerentiable in v, and for ~v = (v0, v1), deﬁne

for any function

X ′((1 − θ)v0 + θv1)dθ,
so that the diﬀerence of X at v0 and v1 can be written as

´X(~v) :=Z 1

(7.10)

(7.11)
The Fr´echet derivatives (N ω)′(v), (N ω)′(v) : H 1 → H −1 and (mω)′(v) : H 1 → R can
be written explicitly as follows.

⊳X(v⊲) = ´X(~v)⊳v⊲.

K. NAKANISHI

A similar expression is obtained for ´N ω(~v) by replacing v in (N ω)′(v) with v0 and v1,
taking the linear combination of such terms. The computation for ´mω(~v) is slightly
more complicated because of the quotient, but still elementary.

The above equation (7.9) is linear in ⊳v⊲, so the diﬀerence quotient, as well as its
limit, namely the derivative, solves the same form of equation. Hence it is convenient
to derive a Lipschitz estimate for general solutions v⋄ of the linear equation

(∂t − iLω)v⋄ = [−iQω ´mω(~v) + ´N ω(~v)]v⋄,

~v := (v0, v1),

(7.13)

where v0, v1 are given functions satisfying for some small δ > 0,

Moreover, t1 = ∞ and (7.25) is valid for all t ≥ t0. Thus we have obtained the

Lemma 7.2. There is a constant C1 ∈ (2C0,∞) such that if δ > 0 is small enough
ul(0,∞) ≤ δ for j = 0, 1, and v⋄ ∈ C([0,∞); H 1)

7.1.3. Uniqueness and regularity of Gω. Let 0 < δ ≪ 1 and ℓ > 0 satisfy (7.33). Let

ul(0,∞) ≤ δ. Then

two solutions of (3.12) on t ∈ [0,∞) satisfying the orthogonality vj(0) ∈ Vω and

Using the local wellposedness of (7.13) as well, we deduce that w is bounded in

The uniqueness of such a solution implies

ω(an, ϕn)(bn, ψn) = G′

ω(a, ϕ)(b, ψ).

Since this holds for any weakly convergent (bn, ψn), we have the convergence of

ω(a, ϕ) in the operator norm. In short, Gω is a C 1 function on a
ω(an, ϕn) → G′
small neighborhood of 0 in R × Zω.
7.2. Nine sets of solutions around the excited states. We have obtained a
manifold for each ω ≥ ω∗ in the local coordinate Cω of Lemma 2.6, that is

Mω

0 := {Mω(θ, b−, ζ) | (b−, ζ) ∈ Uω, θ ∈ R/2πZ},

Mω(θ, b−, ζ) := Cω(θ, Gω(b−, ζ), b−, ζ),

(7.52)

consisting of trapped solutions, in the open neighborhood Cω(Uω) of Qω. Mω
codimension 1, separating the complement into two open sets

0 has

Mω

± := Cω({(θ, b+, b−, ζ) ∈ Uω | ±(b+ − Gω(b−, ζ)) > 0}).

The time inversion of Mω

0 is the complex conjugate

Mω

0 = {Cω(θ, b+, Gω(b+, ζ), ζ) | (b+, ζ) ∈ Uω, θ ∈ R/2πZ},

(7.54)
which is a C 1 manifold of codimension 1 consisting of solutions trapped by Qω for
t ≤ 0. Since gω
0 intersect transversely: the
implicit function theorem yields a unique C 1 function ~Gω : {ζ ∈ Zω | kζkω < δ−} →
{(b+, b−) ∈ R2 | max|b±| < δ−} such that

0 ∩ Mω

and Uω \ (Mω
0 ) consists of four open sets with distinct local behavior in t > 0
and in t < 0, according to sign(b+ − Gω(b−, ζ)) and sign(b− − Gω(b+, ζ)). Thus all
solutions of (3.2) starting near Qω are classiﬁed into 9 non-empty sets of solutions:
(7.56)

{Mω

j ∩ Mω

k}j,k∈{0,±}.

All these about the manifolds rely only on the instability, and they are independent
of the global dynamics investigated in the previous sections.

Under the constraints (6.61) and ω ≥ ω⋆, the scattering/blow-up away from the
excited states also applies to them, leading to the characterization by global behav-
ior:

+ ∩ Hω

∗ ⊂ SωS, Mω

Mω
∗ ⊂ SωB, Mω
∗ denotes the constrained region for ω ≥ ω⋆

∗ := {ϕ ∈ H 1
Hω

r (R3) | Aω(ϕ) < Aω(Qω) + c∗δ2
∗}.

(7.57)

(7.58)

Thus we have proven the existence of inﬁnitely many orbits of the 9 cases in the
main Theorem 1.1. It remains to see that the manifold extends to the entire set of
trapped solutions, together with the threshold property.

7.3. Extension of the manifold. Let δM ∈ (0, δX) so small that δM ≪ cX and
for any ω ≥ ω∗ and any (θ, b+, b−, ζ) ∈ Uω,

dω(Cω(θ, b+, b−, ζ)) < δM =⇒ |b+| < δ+ and max(|b−|,kζkω) < δ−.

(7.59)

(7.60)

Then the trapping lemma 3.5 implies that

Mω

1 := {ϕ ∈ Mω

0 | dω(ϕ) < δM , Aω(ϕ) < Aω(Qω) + cXδ2
M}

is forward invariant by the ﬂow of (3.2). Let Mω

and so ϕs ∈ Mω

The trapping characterization (7.61) of Mω
from the ejected solutions, implies that for any solution uω on Mω
solution uβ(t) := Sβ/ωuω(ωt/β) is also on Mβ
rescaling and unifying over ω yields a C 1 manifold of codimension 1:

for every x ∈ X, M (x) is connected and M (x) ∩ M (z) 6= ∅ for all z in a neighborhood of x. Then
Sx∈X M (x) is also connected.

Restricting ω ≥ ω⋆ and δM ≤ (c∗/cX)1/2δ∗, the scattering/blow-up after departure

is applicable to the solutions oﬀ the manifold. Hence putting

H⋆ := {ϕ ∈ H 1
M⋆ := [ω>ω⋆
S−1
ω Mω

M},

(7.70)

we have

M⋆ = H⋆ ∩ TCδM , H⋆ \ M⋆ = H⋆ ∩ (S ∪ B).

(7.71)
Moreover, around each point ϕ ∈ M⋆, we can ﬁnd a small open ball B(ϕ) ⊂ H⋆
which is separated by M⋆ into S and B. More precisely, B(ϕ) \ M⋆ is open with
two connected components B±(ϕ) such that B+(ϕ) ⊂ S and B−(ϕ) ⊂ B. Then
B⋆ := Sϕ∈M⋆ B(ϕ) is an open neighborhood of M⋆ in H⋆, separated by M⋆ into
two disjoint open sets: B±
⋆ are also connected sets,
because M⋆ is1.
The time inversion M⋆ is a C 1 manifold with codimension 1, consisting of solutions
in H⋆ trapped by Ψ as t → −∞. Hence M⋆ ∩ M⋆ consists of solutions trapped by
Ψ as t → +∞ and as t → −∞. The one-pass lemma 5.2 implies that such a solution
under the constraint stays within O(δM ) distance in H 1
ω around Ψ[ω] of some ω > ω⋆
for all t ∈ R. Hence, taking δM ≪ δ−, we have

codimension 2. The connectedness of M⋆ ∩ M⋆ as well as Mω
2 is proved in
the same way as Mω
2 , namely by reducing the dispersive component ζ in the local
coordinate on Mω
0 . The same is for the connectedness of S ∩ M⋆ and that of
B ∩ M⋆, after rescaling and applying the backward ﬂow in order to send them into
the domain of the local coordinate around Qω.
