Spin glasses have competing interactions that lead to a rough energy landscape which is highly-susceptible
to small perturbations. These chaotic effects strongly affect numerical simulations and, as such, gaining a
deeper understanding of chaos in spin glasses is of much importance. The use of thermal boundary conditions
is an effective approach to study chaotic phenomena. Here, we generalize population annealing Monte Carlo,
combined with thermal boundary conditions, to study bond chaos due to small perturbations in the spin-spin
couplings of the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Ising spin glass. We show that bond and temperature-
induced chaos share the same scaling exponents and that bond chaos is stronger than temperature chaos.

INTRODUCTION

Chaos is a common phenomenon in nonlinear dynamical
systems. Interestingly, complex systems with quenched disor-
der and frustration often display chaotic behaviour in one form
or another. For example, in spin glasses, the thermodynamic
state in thermal equilibrium can change chaotically when an
external parameter, e.g., the temperature is tuned. This is also
the case for small perturbations of the couplings between the
spins, as well as random time-dependent local biases (ﬁeld
chaos). The corresponding chaotic phenomena are therefore
called temperature chaos [1–14], i.e., when the temperature is
changed, and bond chaos [10, 11], when the interactions be-
tween the spins are changed. Chaos is believed to be related
to hysteresis phenomena, memory and rejuvenation effects in
spin glasses [15–18], as well as the generic computational
hardness of disordered systems [13, 19, 20]. Therefore, chaos
is related to both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium proper-
ties of dynamical systems. Chaos is also of paramount impor-
tance in analog optimization machines, such as the D-Wave
Systems Inc. D-Wave 2X quantum annealer. Given the intrin-
sic analog implementation of the device, small problem mis-
speciﬁcations might lead to the solution of a different Hamil-
tonian altogether. While temperature is well controlled in
these analog machines, precisely encoding the spin-spin inter-
actions (or qubit-qubit couplers) has proven to be difﬁcult due
to the limited precision of the device. Given the importance
of bond chaos to these novel computing paradigms [20, 21],
in this work we investigate bond chaos of spin glasses as a
prototypical example of the effects of changing the quenched
disorder – a problem far less studied than temperature chaos.
One intriguing numerical result [10, 11] is that temperature
chaos and bond chaos [22] appear to follow the same scal-
ing properties, and that bond chaos is considerably stronger
than temperature chaos. However, these observations were
left unexplained in Refs. [10, 11]. Here, we provide sim-

ple explanations of both results within the framework of the
droplet/scaling picture [4, 23–26] by assuming that tempera-
ture chaos is mainly entropy driven, whereas bond chaos is
mainly energy driven. Previous work have studied chaotic
effects using correlation and overlap functions between dif-
ferent parameters. Here we use an alternate approach: we
study bond chaos using thermal boundary conditions [19, 27],
in which all 2d combinations of periodic and anti-periodic
boundary conditions in the d directions (space dimensions)
appear in the simulation with their appropriate Boltzmann
weights.
In this setting, the weights of boundary condition
crossings mimic the exchange of dominance of the more ab-
stract pure states. Furthermore, we generalize the population
annealing (PA) Monte Carlo [28–31] algorithm to simulate
bond chaos in glassy systems. One advantage of this approach
is that many disorder realizations up to a small perturbation
can be studied in a single simulation run, yet have enough dy-
namical range in the perturbations to study the scaling prop-
erties of chaotic effects.

The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst discuss the
model, simulation methods and scaling properties of bond
chaos in Sec. II, followed by numerical results on bond chaos
compared to previous results on temperature chaos in Sec. III.
Concluding remarks are stated in Sec. IV.

II. MODELS AND METHODS

In this Section we review technical details of our study, such
as the model, numerical and analysis methods, as well as sim-
ulation details.

A. Model

We simulate the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson

(EA) Ising spin glass represented by the Hamiltonian

H = −(cid:88)

(cid:104)ij(cid:105)

JijSiSj,

(1)

where Si ∈ {±1} are Ising spins. The sum (cid:104)ij(cid:105) is over the
nearest neighbour sites in a cubic lattice with N = L3 sites.
The coupling Jij between spins Si and Sj is chosen from a
Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. We refer to
each disorder realization as a “sample.”

B. Generalized population annealing Monte Carlo

Reference [31] provides a detailed description of popula-
tion annealing Monte Carlo (hereafter referred to as PA). The
“standard” population annealing Monte Carlo method main-
tains thermal equilibrium whilst resampling of a population
of replicas when temperature is lowered in a sequential man-
ner, followed by regular Monte Carlo sweeps. Because bond
chaos can be simulated at a ﬁxed temperature, but requires
perturbations of the spin-spin interactions, we need to gener-
alize the PA algorithm. The generalization can be understood
best when viewing the resampling step as a transformation of
the distribution.

Suppose we have a set of equilibrium states at inverse tem-
perature β = 1/T and we would like to have a set of equilib-
rium states at inverse temperature β(cid:48). If replica i has energy
Ei, then the expected number of copies τi to make of replica
i is

τi =

1
Q

e−(β(cid:48)−β)Ei with Q =

1
R0

e−(β(cid:48)−β)Ei.

(2)

Here, R0 is the expectation value of the population sizes. Now
suppose we have a set of equilibrium states at β given the
interactions J and we now instead would like to transform the
states to a set of equilibrium states at the same temperature β
but with different J (cid:48). A similar transformation can be carried
out if we let

τi =

1
Q

e−β(E(cid:48)

i−Ei) with Q =

1
R0

e−β(E(cid:48)

i−Ei).

(3)

i and Ei are the energy of replica i with bonds J (cid:48)
In Eq. (3), E(cid:48)
and J , respectively, with the spins in each replica held ﬁxed.
One can summarize Eqs. (2) and (3) using reduced Hamil-
tonians H = βH. For two sets of close (similar) distributions
on the same state space with Boltzmann factors of exp[−Hi]
and exp[−H(cid:48)

of replicas from H to H(cid:48),

(4)

Within this framework, one can perturb the system either by
a change in temperature, by a change in the spin-spin interac-
tions, or both using PA. Finally, we note that the free-energy
difference can be generalized, too, using the free-energy per-
turbation method as −β(cid:48)F (cid:48) = −βF + (cid:104)exp[−(H(cid:48) − H)](cid:105)H,
although the free energy is not needed in this work.

C. Scaling analysis

2

Suppose the free energy cost to ﬂip a droplet of size (cid:96) at
temperature β scales as (cid:96)θ with disorder J , and the free en-
ergy cost to perturb the bonds with δJ for the droplet and
the ﬂipped droplet is ∆F1 and ∆F2, respectively. Then the
free-energy cost to ﬂip the droplet at J (cid:48) = J + δJ is (cid:96)θ +
∆F2 − ∆F1, with θ the stiffness exponent. One can see that
the effect of changes in the spin-spin interactions for the last
two terms is nonzero only at the surface of the droplet due to
spin-reversal symmetry. Because ∆F = ∆E − T ∆S, and as-
suming the energy difference dominates when we change the
couplings and therefore, the last two terms scale as δJ (cid:96)ds/2,
where ds/2 is the fractal dimension of the boundary of the
droplet. Putting everything together, the free-energy cost to
ﬂip the droplet at J (cid:48) scales as (cid:96)θ − δJ (cid:96)ds/2, and therefore the
strength δJ needed for bond chaos scales as

where

δJ ∼ 1
(cid:96)ζ ,

ζ = ds/2 − θ.

(5)

(6)

This simple derivation using droplet arguments suggests that
bond chaos effects should be described by the same scaling
exponents (θ, ds/2 and ζ) as temperature chaos [11, 19].

Following Refs. [19, 27], θ can be calculated using sample
stiffness scaling, ds/2 can be calculated using the scaling of
energy differences at boundary condition crossings, and ζ is
related to the scaling of the number of dominant crossings.
We brieﬂy summarize the scaling of these quantities here. Let
fJ be the maximum weights of all the boundary conditions
for sample J at a ﬁxed β, then the sample stiffness is deﬁned
as

λJ = log

fJ
1 − fJ

.

(7)

Note that this is an estimator of the free-energy difference
(times −β) between the dominant boundary conditions and
all other boundary conditions in sample J . Let GL(λ) be the
cumulative distribution function for λ, then it was shown in
Ref. [27] that the function 1 − GL(λ) is approximately ex-
ponential, which then allows for a scaling analysis. Deﬁne a
characteristic λchar(L) such that 1 − G(λ) = e−λ/λchar and
1 − G(λchar log b) = 1/b for any b. The value b should be
chosen such that λchar is obtained from the tail of the distri-
bution but not so far into the tail where the statistics are poor.
For T = 0.5 (dimensionless units), we choose b = 10. We
have veriﬁed that the distribution functions for different linear
system sizes L collapse well onto the same curve after being
scaled by λchar(L). Regular spin stiffness scaling then gives
(8)
If the absolute energy difference |∆E| is the energy difference
at all registered boundary condition crossings above a cutoff
threshold pc, then ds/2 can be obtained from

λchar ∼ Lθ.

|∆E| ∼ Lds/2,

(9)

3

where one can either use the mean or the median of |∆E|. To
reduce ﬁnite-size effects, one can use the number of dominant
boundary condition crossings NC instead of the total number
of registered crossings to compute ζ from

NC ∼ Lζ.

D. Simulation details

We start by discussing how to simulate bond chaos for a
single disorder realization. In the reduced Hamiltonian rep-
resentation, we can either change the inverse temperature β
or perturb the spin-spin interactions J . We use the following
procedure to change the interactions: For each disorder re-
alization J0, we choose an independent perturbation J (cid:48) and
change the original bonds as

J =

J0 + cJ (cid:48)
√
1 + c2

,

(11)

where c ∈ [0, 0.1] is a small number.
In this manner, for
each value of the perturbation strength c, a Gaussian disorder
distribution is preserved [11, 22, 32, 33].

From now on, within the reduced Hamiltonian representa-
tion, we vary the parameters β and c in the (β, c) plane. We
start the simulation ﬁrst with ﬁxed c from β = 0 down to
β = 2. This takes the system from the paramagnetic to the
spin-glass phase. Following this anneal in temperature, we ﬁx
β = 2 and change the bond perturbation strength c in the in-
terval [0, 0.1] to induce chaotic effects. To double-check our
results, we have chosen the interactions of the unperturbed
system, J0, from the study of temperature chaos in Ref. [19].
The perturbed interactions J (cid:48) were chosen independently. We
ﬁrst do a temperature anneal of the system from β = 0 to
β = 2 at c = 0.1 ﬁxed, and then we change c from 0.1 to
0. In this way, the ﬁnal interaction conﬁguration is the same
as J0, which allows us to compare the results directly to the
ones from our temperature chaos study in Ref. [19]. It is of
paramount importance to verify after both simulation paths
that the weights of each boundary conditions {pi} agree. In
our simulations, we require the family entropy Sf ≥ log(100)
(where Sf is a measure of equilibration discussed in Ref. [31])
for each path as well as max{|pi − p(cid:48)
i|} ≤ 0.05, where {pi}
and {p(cid:48)
i} are the weights of each boundary conditions from
the two distinct paths, respectively, for each sample.
Computationally hard samples that do not fulﬁll the two
equilibration criteria were either rerun with a larger popula-
tion size or by breaking the c path into two or more segments,
where each segment separately is considerably easier to equi-
librate. Figure 1 shows an example of how the c path is split
into two pieces (Path II.A and II.B). Measurements along Path
II.B require an additional population annealing run starting at

β = 0 and c = 0.05. Whenever runs are combined, we test
the family entropy of each run, as well as the matching of
boundary conditions between the different runs.

FIG. 1: (Color online) Schematic of simulation paths. In all cases,
ﬁrst a quench from β = 0 to β = 2 is performed. For the bond
chaos case, an additional set of simulations for β = 2 along the
c-axis from c = 0.1 to c = 0 is performed. Path I represents a
simulation to probe for temperature chaos. Path II represents a bond
chaos simulation. If the sample is computationally difﬁcult, one can
either rerun Path II with a larger population size or split Path II into
two or more segments. In this example Paths II.A and II.B are each
run independently.

We have carried out a large-scale simulation of bond chaos
for linear system sizes L = 4, 6, 8 and 10, with 2001 samples
for each system size. The details of the simulation parameters
are summarized in Table. I.

III. RESULTS

A. Scaling properties of bond chaos

The boundary condition probabilities of a sample of linear
size L = 8 is shown in Fig. 2, displaying chaotic behavior via
several boundary condition crossings. Because bond chaos
is much stronger than temperature chaos (see Sec. III B), we

from temperature chaos [19], showing that temperature chaos
and bond chaos indeed share the same set of scaling expo-
nents.

have only registered crossings above a threshold of pc = 0.1
when two boundary conditions cross as a function of c. Fig-
ure 3 shows a histogram of the distribution of crossings as a
function of c, which is relatively ﬂat, as expected. On the other
hand, the distribution of the crossings is approximately expo-
nential as a function of β when chaotic effects are induced by
thermal changes [19].

ings, i.e., chaotic events. Three of the eight boundary conditions have
probabilities too small to be seen on the plot.

FIG. 4: (Color online) Scaling of the measured quantities as a func-
tion of system size. The log-log plot clearly shows that the different
quantities are well ﬁt with a power law. The slope of the number
of dominant crossings scales as NC ∼ Lζ, the energy difference at
all registered boundary condition crossings above pc = 0.1 scales as
∆E ∼ Lds/2, and λchar ∼ Lθ. Note that for the energy difference at
all registered boundary condition crossings both the median ∆Emed
and average (cid:104)∆E(cid:105) have the same slope within error bars. Error bars
are smaller than the symbols.

B. Comparison of temperature and bond chaos

Next, we compare the relative strength of temperature
chaos and bond chaos. A natural quantity to compare is the
number of dominant crossings NC. However, due to the dif-
ferent types of perturbations (temperature β vs interactions
c), we need to compare fairly the the density of crossing with
respect to β and c. The relative strength of the perturbation
of temperature chaos to bond chaos seen from the reduced
Hamiltonian is

∆β
β∆c

.

(16)

The distribution of crossings of bond chaos is approximately
uniformly distributed, therefore, the density of crossings for

FIG. 3: (Color online) Distribution of all crossings above a cutoff of
pc = 0.1 as a function of c. The distributions are relatively uniform
compared to the distributions of temperature chaos [19] which are
exponential. Note that the horizontal axis has been multiplied by 10
for better viewing.

The system-size scaling of the number of dominant cross-
ings NC, sample stiffness λchar, mean and median of the en-
ergy cost at boundary condition crossings (cid:104)∆E(cid:105) and ∆Emed,
respectively are all shown in Fig. 4. We have used data at
both (β = 2, c = 0) and (β = 2, c = 0.1) after a tempera-

bond chaos (BC) is simply given by

.

The distribution for temperature chaos is more compli-
cated and is approximately exponential in the range β ∈
[βmin, βmax] = [1.5, 3] for all system sizes studied in
Ref. [19]. An exponential ﬁt of the form

ae−aβ

N (β) =

e−βmina − e−βmaxa ,

(18)
with β ∈ [1.5, 3] yields a ≈ 1.12. This suggests that the
density of crossing distributions at β = 2 is approximately
1.18 times larger than that of the averaged density in the whole
temperature range [1.5, 3]. We note that the ratio depends only
very weakly on a. The corresponding density of crossings for
temperature chaos (TC) is therefore given by

dynamical process. To this effect, we use an alternate deﬁni-
tion of the relative strength κ, namely

(cid:28) ∂|∆E|

(cid:29)(cid:46)(cid:28) ∂|∆(T S)|

(cid:29)

where the derivative is evaluated using ﬁnite element methods
at the same temperature β = 2. This theoretical prediction of
κ is also shown in Fig. 5 (blue squares). Note that Eq. (22)
also explains why κ does not depend on the system size from
the same scaling properties of ∆E and ∆(T S). The predic-
tions are reasonably close, showing that bond chaos is indeed
energy driven, while temperature chaos is entropy driven.

(19)

Using ∆c = 0.1, β = 2, ∆β = 1.5, and NC for the whole
perturbation range of both types of chaos in Eqs. (17) and (19),
we can deﬁne a quantity κ that quantiﬁes the relative strength
of bond chaos and temperature chaos as

boundary condition crossings of bond chaos and temperature
chaos, respectively. A plot of κ as a function of the linear
system size L is shown in Fig. 5 (red circles). Note that κ is
almost a constant function of L, as expected from the scaling
properties of NC. Averaging over the studied system sizes L,
we ﬁnd that

κ ≈ 16(1).

(21)

Therefore, bond chaos is more than one order of magnitude
stronger than temperature chaos at low temperatures (β = 2).
It is interesting that our result is very close to the value of 17.5
quoted in Ref. [10] even though the two values are computed
using fundamentally different methods and models. Note that
the difference of the threshold to register crossings does not
affect the number of dominate boundary condition crossings
and therefore also κ, as in both cases, a dominant boundary
condition crossing cannot occur below the chosen threshold,
pc = 0.1 for bond chaos and pc = 0.05 for temperature chaos.
We propose a simple physical interpretation for κ. At ﬁrst
sight, one might expect that the scale of ∆E and ∆(T S)
might be relevant to explain κ. However, while we ﬁnd this
is indeed a factor—especially at low temperatures—this is not
sufﬁcient. We ﬁnd that the strength of responses of the quan-
tities with respect to c and β are more relevant, as chaos is a

ture chaos, κ, as a function of system size L computed from Eq. (20)
(red circles) and Eq. (22) (blue squares). Using droplet scaling argu-
ments one can show that κ does not depend on the system size.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have studied bond chaos using thermal
boundary conditions via a generalization of population an-
nealing Monte Carlo. We provided a simple explanation as to
why temperature chaos and bond chaos share the same set of
scaling exponents within the framework of the droplet/scaling
picture. We also show quantitatively that bond chaos is ap-
proximately one order of magnitude stronger than temperature
chaos. A simple physical picture is proposed that explains the
relative strength, identifying that bond chaos is energy driven,
whereas temperature chaos is entropy driven. As such, the
surface of excitations plays a key role in these phenomena.
Our work on temperature and bond chaos also establishes the
validity of the use of thermal boundary conditions to study
chaotic phenomena in disordered systems.

We use this opportunity to emphasize that the fact that bond
chaos is so much stronger than temperature chaos should be
source of concern in analog computing machines, such as the
D-Wave Systems Inc. DW2X. While slight temperature vari-
ations of the device might only affect the encoded problem

510152046810κL6

slightly, small perturbations of the couplers might change the
encoded Hamiltonian and yield erroneous results.

We intend to apply the method used here to other paradig-
matic spin-glass systems,
such as the four-dimensional
Edwards-Anderson Ising spin glass. A more challenging and
intriguing problem is to investigate ﬁeld chaos in the mean-
ﬁeld Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model [34]—which also has a
spin-glass phase in an external magnetic ﬁeld—using a gener-
alized deﬁnition of boundary conditions.
