We demonstrate stable control of a massive oscillator’s displacement response to an applied force,
an important step towards reveling the quantum behavior of massive objects. In this technique,
a suspended mirror is optically trapped via a detuned cavity, and its dissipation is controlled by
electrical active feedback on an another mirror, which generates damping forces on the target mirror
through optical rigidity. We experimentally demonstrate the technique with a 5-mg suspended
mirror, which is a part of a triangular optical cavity. The observed enhancement of the pendulum’s
resonant frequency is from 2.14 Hz to 1.06 kHz, and the lowest temperature achieved is 15 mK.
Using this technique we demonstrate reduction of the thermal decoherence rate, i.e. the inverse
time of the absorption of a phonon from the thermal environment, of 60-fold from its bare value.

Introduction.— Macroscopic mechanical oscillators
which are well isolated have the potential to be used
as quantum devices [1–4] and shed light on fundamen-
tal physics such as gravitational waves [5], wave-function
collapse [6–10], and the minimal length scale [11, 12].
Isolation from the thermal environment with occupation
¯nth reduces an oscillator’s (energy) dissipation rate γm.
Thus thermal disturbances of the oscillator, i.e. the rate
of increase of the oscillator’s average phonon number hni,
should be decreased according to the expression:

dhni
dt

(t = 0) ≃ ¯nthγm

(1)

Here the oscillator is initially cooled, i.e. hni(t = 0) ≪
¯nth. This expression shows that a well isolated oscillator
with resonant frequency ωm/(2π) larger than ¯nthγm has
the potential to coherently oscillate over one mechanical
period before thermal excitation. Thus the heating rate
is often referred to as the thermal decoherence rate.

Since isolation of a macroscopic object is diﬃcult,
other approaches to reduce thermal decoherence become
more important. Currently, various techniques to di-
lute the eﬀects of dissipation have been explored, see,
e.g.
[13–15]. These are based on trapping of dissipa-
tive mechanical energy in a low-loss optical potential so
that the number of quanta in the trapped mode is re-
duced by a factor of ωeﬀ/ωm from its bare value given
by ¯nth = kBT /(¯hωm), where ωeﬀ/(2π) is the resonant
frequency in the presence of the optical trap, kB is the
Boltzmann’s constant, T is the room temperature, and
¯h is the reduced Planck constant. The corresponding
decoherence rate is thus reduced by the same factor.

It may therefore be seen that the stable combination

of cooling and dilution techniques, so that hni(t = 0) < 1
and ωeﬀ/(2π) > ¯nthγmωm/ωeﬀ, would represent an im-
portant step towards revealing quantum eﬀects of a truly
macroscopic oscillator.
In this Letter, we present sta-
ble optoelectrical control of an optically trapped mirror’s
dissipation, thereby creating active feedback cooling (cf.
[16–18]) for the mirror. By turning oﬀ the cooling sys-
tem, we observe the time evolution of the initially cooled
oscillator, and hence the thermal decoherence rate. Our
technique involves a blue-detuned triangular optical cav-
ity that consists of the optically trapped suspended mir-
ror and two mirrors which are negligibly moved by the
light pressure. This design makes the system stable with
respect to the mirror’s yaw motion [19].

We increase the resonant frequency of the pendulum
mode from 2.14 Hz up to 1.06 kHz as the cavity detun-
ing is increased, while the mode’s temperature Teﬀ is de-
creased to 15 mK corresponding to a phonon number of
neﬀ = 4.6 × 105. We observe dependence of the ther-
mal decoherence rate on the optical rigidity, and 60-fold
reduction from its bare value. Our results and analysis
substantiate the potential of the technique to achieve a
massive oscillator satisfying ωeﬀ/(2π) > ¯nthγmωm/ωeﬀ.

Experimental design.— Our experiment consists of an
optical cavity created by a suspended 5-mg(=mpend) mir-
ror, a suspended 1×102-g(=mc) mirror which is attached
to coil-magnet actuators for active feedback, and a ﬁxed
mirror [Fig. 1(a)]. The cavity is pumped by an optical
laser blue-detuned from the cavity frequency ωcav/(2π) so
that the mirrors are coupled to an optical spring (see e.g.
[20]) of a frequency-dependent spring constant kopt. The
reﬂected light is measured by a photo detector, whose
voltage signal is ﬁltered and then fed back to the actua-

of the cavity. (c) The servo ﬁlters. After prelocking of the cavity length, it is switched oﬀ and then the gain of the highpass
ﬁlter is increased. By mixing square waves, the cooling system is rapidly switched oﬀ so that the thermal decoherence rate
can be observed. (d) Parametric plot of the optical spring (as a curve) and optoelectrical feedback (as vertical lines and a
horizontal line) as a function of detuning ∆ and gain gel of the feedback system χfb = iωgel, respectively. At zero detuning
from resonance (∆ = 0), both the resonant frequency and the damping rate are equal to the intrinsic ones. At zero gain of the
electrical servo (gel = 0), feedback cooling vanishes. Parameter values are ωpend/(2π) = ωc/(2π) = 1 Hz, γpend/(2π) = 10−6 Hz,
γc/(2π) = 10−2 Hz, κ/(2π) = κin/(2π) = 2 × 106 Hz, g = ωlaser, ¯ncav = 8.5 × 105/[1 + (∆/κ)2], and gf = 2 × 10−8 N/m/Hz.

tors. The corresponding block diagram is shown in Fig.
1(b). The mechanical susceptibility (i.e. displacement re-
sponse to an applied force F ) of the 5-mg movable mirror
obeys the following equation:

χeﬀ ≡

δxpend

F

= χpend

1 + ζ2χcχfb

1 + ζ 2

1 χpendkopt + ζ2χcχfb

(2)

Here δxpend is the displacement of the movable mirror,
χpend(χc) is the bare mechanical susceptibility of the 5-
mg (1 × 102-g) mirror, ζ1 (ζ2) is the derivative of the
cavity length l with respect to the position of the the
5-mg (1 × 102-g) mirror, and χfb is the feedback sys-
tem. χfb consists of the derivative of the cavity’s power
reﬂectivity with respect to the cavity length, the detec-
tor, servo ﬁlters [details are shown in Fig. 1(c)], and the
actuators. The optical spring constant is given by the
following equation in the frequency domain:

kopt = 2¯hg2¯ncav

∆

(κ + iω)2 + ∆2

(3)

Here g(≡ dωcav/dl) is a coupling rate, ¯ncav is the average
photon number in the cavity, ∆ is the cavity detuning,
κ is the cavity amplitude decay rate, and ω/(2π) is the
Fourier frequency. For the massive and the ﬁxed mirrors,
the optical spring is negligible since it hardly changes the
dynamics of the these mirrors. From Eqs. (2) and (3),
dissipation of the movable mirror is controlled by the
(servo) highpass ﬁlter because damping forces made by
the ﬁlter are transfered to the movable mirror through
the optical rigidity. For the ﬁxed feedback gain, the ef-
fective dissipation (i.e. degree of cooling) thus depends
on the optical rigidity [cf. vertical lines in Fig. 1(d)]. For
strong optical rigidity, the optical anti-damping is can-
celed by the following feedback system [a horizontal line

in Fig. 1(d)]:

Here we suppose ω ≪ √∆2 + κ2.

Note that the optoelectrical cooling presented here is
“active” because the servo system directly suppresses
thermal motion. Passive cooling with a servo-modiﬁed
optical spring has been reported by C. M. Mow-Lowry
et al.
[21]. An advantage of active cooling is that it is
possible to realize the ground state for the bad cavity
condition given by ωm ≪ κ [22]. This condition is also
required to probe spacetime using pulsed light [11].
Parameters.— The cavity has a round-trip length L =
8.7 ± 0.2 cm and is installed in a chamber at a pressure
of 9 Pa. The 5-mg (1 × 102-g) mirror has a bare pen-
dulum frequency ωpend/(2π) [ωc/(2π)] of 2.14 Hz [2.89
Hz]. The 5-mg mirror is suspended by a tungsten wire
3 um in diameter with a bare energy dissipation rate
of γpend/(2π) = (1.2 ± 0.1) × 10−2 Hz [i.e. Qpend ≡
ωpend/γpend = (1.8 ± 0.1) × 102], while the 1 × 102-g
mirror is suspended by four tungsten wires 30 um in di-
ameter with a bare rate of γc/(2π) = (5.4±0.2)×10−2 Hz
(i.e. Qc = 54 ± 2). The ﬁnesse of the cavity is
F = (1.98 ± 0.08) × 103 corresponding to a total am-
plitude decay rate of κ/(2π) = 0.84 ± 0.03 MHz. The
ratio of the input coupler’s decay rate to the total de-
cay rate is κin/κ = 0.19 ± 0.01. The laser frequency
is ωlaser/(2π) ≃ 300 THz (Coherent Inc. Mephisto),
and the maximum input laser power to the cavity is
47± 5 mW. The beam is incident on the movable mirror
at an angle β, where cos β = 0.78 ± 0.04.
Calibration.— To obtain the displacement spectrum
Sx(ω), we observe the reﬂected light from the cavity.

For the case of ωeﬀ/(2π) = 662 Hz, the thermal noise
dominates under the resonance [dotted lines in Fig. 2(d)].
Thermal decoherence rate.— After cooling we rapidly
make the gain of the highpass ﬁlter equal to nearly zero
(as in Eq. (4) mcω2
eﬀ /κ ∼ 0) so that relaxation process
is observed. Since both the transfer functions χeﬀ and
χeﬀ/(χpendg) consist of ﬁrst-order lag elements that have
the same real part of the pole γeﬀ , the average phonon
number will evolve according to the expression:

Here ¯n′th[¯nth] is kBT /(¯hωeﬀ)[kBT /(¯hωpend)], and ¯nfreq(≡
mpendωeﬀR ∞
0 Sfreqdω/¯h) is the phonon number excited
by the frequency coupling in the absence of active cooling.
We use a square wave as an on/oﬀ switch for the cool-
ing [Fig. 1(c)]. By injecting 100 seconds of the wave at
1 Hz, we repeatedly measure the decoherence rate [Fig.
3(a)]. We observe the rate as the cavity detuning (i.e.
optical rigidity) was varied [circles in Fig. 3(b)]. The
results are ﬁtted to the theoretical prediction shown as
a solid curve. The frequency coupling presently limits
the achievable rate. The lowest rate is (3.5 ± 0.8) × 109,
which is a 60-fold reduction from its bare value given
by ¯nthγpend. Since the oscillation number nosc before
thermal excitation is given by ωeﬀ /[2πdhni/dt], it is fur-
thermore improved by a factor of ωeﬀ/ωpend. Thus, the

Here SV(ω) is the one-sided power spectrum of the ob-
served voltage signal, c is the speed of light, and η is the
voltage-to-power conversion factor of the detector.

We ﬁrst calibrate the ﬁnesse by sweeping the laser
through the cavity [Fig. 2(a)]. We then trap the movable
mirror using the optical spring created by the 0.82± 0.08
mW incident laser. We calibrate the ratio κin/κ and
ζ1 = 2 cos β by measuring the dependence of the eﬀec-
tive resonant frequency on the detuning [Fig. 2(b)].

Cooling.— After prelocking the cavity length, we make
the gain equal to zero so that the length is passively sta-
bilized by the optical rigidity. We then actively control
the dissipation of the movable mirror.

We show examples of the cooling spectra in Figs. 2(c)-
(d) with varying the gain of the highpass ﬁlter. We in-
tegrate the each observed spectral peak within 3 σ to
eﬀhx2i/kB.

The lowest temperature is 15 ± 3 mK at ωeﬀ/(2π) =
(6.62 ± 0.07) × 102 Hz. For the case of ωeﬀ /(2π) > 662
Hz, the degree of cooling is saturated since resonance at
2.7 kHz [cf. Fig. 2(e)] prevents us from increasing the
gain to a suﬃcient high level.
For the noise analysis, we ﬁnd that the frequency un-
certainty of the pump laser δf [Hz/√Hz] and the pen-
dulum’s Brownian motion (thermal noise) are dominat-
ing. Frequency ﬂuctuations modulate the optical spring,

and result in the displacement spectrum pSfreq(ω) =
δf|χeﬀ/[χpend(1 + ζ2χcχfb)g]|. We calibrate χfb by mea-
suring the open-loop gain ζ2χcχfb/(1 + ζ 2

Here the value of δf is also feasible by stabilization [26].
nosc > 1 is thus achievable by optical dilution.

Conclusion.— We measured the thermal decoherence
rate of a pendulum mode as the optical rigidity was var-
ied. Our analysis substantiates the feasibility of reducing
the rate under the pendulum’s resonant frequency, even
in the presence of the laser’s frequency ﬂuctuations. Our
results represent an important step towards the goal of
realizing a quantum massive suspended mirror.
