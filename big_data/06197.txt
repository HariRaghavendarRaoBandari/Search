ON BASE POINT FREE THEOREM AND MORI DREAM

SPACES FOR LOG CANONICAL THREEFOLDS OVER

THE ALGEBRAIC CLOSURE OF A FINITE FIELD

YUSUKE NAKAMURA AND JAKUB WITASZEK

Abstract. The authors and D. Martinelli proved in [MNW15] the base
point free theorem for big line bundles on a three-dimensional log canon-
ical projective pair deﬁned over the algebraic closure of a ﬁnite ﬁeld. In
this paper, we drop the bigness condition when the characteristic is
larger than ﬁve. Additionally, we discuss Mori dream spaces deﬁned
over the algebraic closure of a ﬁnite ﬁeld.

1. Introduction

One of the most prominent problems in algebraic geometry is to classify
all smooth projective varieties.
In characteristic zero, this goal has been
partially achieved due to the developments of the Minimal Model Program.
In order to construct a single step of the MMP, it is necessary to invoke the
base point free theorem (cf. [KMM87, Theorem 3.1.1]), which asserts that a
nef line bundle D on a Kawamata log terminal projective pair (X, ∆) deﬁned
over an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero is semiample when
D − (KX + ∆) is nef and big. Unfortunately, the existence of a resolution of
singularities and the Kawamata–Viehweg vanishing theorem are essential in
the proof, and hence it is not valid in positive characteristic. Even so, Tanaka
managed to prove the base point free theorem for positive characteristic
surfaces, and Keel showed it for threefolds over the algebraic closure of a
ﬁnite ﬁeld Fp in the case when D is big.

Recent years brought further breakthrough results. The progress in the
positive characteristic Minimal Model Program ([HX15], [CTX15], [Bir]),
led to a proof of the base point free theorem for threefolds over algebraically
closed ﬁelds of characteristic p larger than ﬁve, with an assumption that D
is big ([Bir] and [Xu15]), and, eventually, without the bigness assumption
([BW], see Theorem 2.6).

Over the algebraic closure Fp of a ﬁnite ﬁeld, the authors and D. Martinelli

proved in [MNW15] a stronger result in the case when D is big.

Theorem 1.1 ([MNW15, Theorem 1.1]). Let (X, ∆) be a three-dimensional
projective log canonical pair deﬁned over Fp, and let D be a nef and big Q-
Cartier Q-divisor on X. If D − (KX + ∆) is also nef and big, then D is
semiample.

Furthermore, in [MNW15] the above assertion is proved also for three-
dimensional projective (possibly non-log canonical) log pairs (X, ∆) such
that all the coeﬃcients of ∆ are at most one and each irreducible component
of Supp(⌊∆⌋) is normal. This is a generalization of Keel’s result [Kee99],
who showed the same assertion under the stronger assumption that ⌊∆⌋ = 0.
We also note that Theorem 1.1 is not true for any other algebraically
closed ﬁeld k 6= Fp even in the two-dimensional case (see [Tan14, Example
A.3]).

The main aim of this paper is to drop the assumption that D is big in

Theorem 1.1, when the characteristic is larger than ﬁve:

Theorem 1.2 (Main theorem). Let (X, ∆) be a three-dimensional projective
log canonical pair deﬁned over Fp of characteristic p larger than ﬁve, and
let D be a nef Q-Cartier Q-divisor on X. If D − (KX + ∆) is nef and big,
then D is semiample.

In the proof of Theorem 1.2, we run a D-crepant MMP and ﬁnish oﬀ by
combining three types of base point free theorems: Theorem 1.1, Theorem
2.3, and Theorem 2.6. The key ingredient for running this MMP is the
minimal model program developed in [Bir] and [BW], and the boundedness
of the lengths of extremal rays ([BW, Theorem 1.1 (ii)]). In order to use
results from [BW], we need to assume that p > 5.

The ultimate goal of the research conducted here and in [MNW15] is to
gain a better understanding of new phenomena happening over Fp, and seek
further results around the minimal model program which are valid only over
these algebraically closed ﬁelds. In the spirit of this, it is natural to ask the
following question.

Question 1.3. Let (X, ∆) be a log canonical projective three-dimensional
pair deﬁned over Fp. Assume that −(KX + ∆) is nef and big. Is X a Mori
dream space?

When (X, ∆) is klt and the base ﬁeld is of characteristic zero, then it is
well known that the answer to the above question is positive ([BCHM10,
Corollary 1.3.2]), but without the klt assumption this does not hold.

The aforementioned question is motivated by the validity of the log canon-
ical base point free theorem in characteristic p > 5 (Theorem 1.2). Under
the assumption of Question 1.3, if p > 5, then any nef line bundle on X is
semiample. Indeed, if L is a nef line bundle, then

L − (KX + ∆)

is nef and big, and so L is semiample by Theorem 1.2.
In particular, X
satisﬁes one of the conditions in the deﬁnition of a Mori dream space (cf.
Deﬁnition 4.1).

Unfortunately, the answer to the above question is in general negative, as

we show in Theorem 4.6.

We note that some results on the Minimal Model Program for log canon-
ical threefolds deﬁned over algebraically closed ﬁelds of characteristic larger
than ﬁve have been recently established in [Wal]. Further, the abundance
conjecture for log canonical fourfolds in characteristic zero with a big bound-
ary has been recently obtained in [Has].

Notation and conventions.

• When we work over a normal variety X, we often identify a line
bundle L with the divisor corresponding to L. For example, we use
the additive notation L + A for a line bundle L and a divisor A.

• Following the notation of [Kee99], for a morphism f : X → Y and a

line bundle L on Y , we denote by L|X the pullback f ∗L.

• We say that a line bundle L on X is semiample when the linear
system |mL| is base point free for some integer m. When L is semi-
ample, the surjective map f : X → Y , deﬁned by |mL| for a suﬃ-
ciently large and divisible positive integer m, satisﬁes f∗OX = OY .
We call f the semiample ﬁbration associated to L.

• A log pair (X, ∆) is a normal variety X together with an eﬀective

Q-divisor ∆ such that KX + ∆ is Q-Cartier.

For a proper birational morphism f : X ′ → X from a normal

variety X ′, we write

KX ′ + X

aiEi = f ∗(KX + ∆),

i

where Ei are prime divisors. We say that the pair (X, ∆) is log
canonical if ai ≤ 1 for any proper birational morphism f . Further,
we say that the pair (X, ∆) is Kawamata log terminal (klt for short)
if ai < 1 for any proper birational morphism f .

We call a log pair (X, ∆) divisorial log terminal (dlt for short)
when there exists a log resolution f : X ′ → X such that ai < 1 for
any f -exceptional divisor Ei on X ′.

• We denote by Nef(X) the cone of nef R-divisors on X up to numerical
equivalence and by Mov(X) the cone of mobile R-divisors on X up
to numerical equivalence.

• We denote by Pic0(X) the identity component of the Picard scheme
Pic(X) of a variety X deﬁned over a ﬁeld k. We call NS(X) :=
Pic(X)/ Pic0(X) the Neron-Severi group.

2. Preliminaries

In this section, we list some propositions about semiampleness of line

bundles, which are necessary for the proof of Theorem 1.2.

First, on projective curves over Fp, the nefness and the semiampleness are

equivalent.

Lemma 2.1. Let D be a nef line bundle on a projective curve deﬁned over
Fp. Then D is semiample.

Proof. This easily follows from the fact that a numerically trivial line bundle
on a projective variety over Fp is always torsion (cf. [Kee99, Lemma 2.16]).
(cid:3)

On projective surfaces over Fp, a nef and big line bundle is always semi-

ample.

Theorem 2.2 ([Art62, Theorem 2.9], cf. [Kee99, Corollary 0.3]). Let D be
a nef and big line bundle on a projective surface deﬁned over Fp. Then D
is semiample.

4

YUSUKE NAKAMURA AND JAKUB WITASZEK

Further, on projective surfaces over Fp, the base point free theorem is

known under much weaker assumptions than usual.

Theorem 2.3 ([MNW15, Theorem 1.4]). Let D be a nef Q-divisor on a
normal projective surface S deﬁned over Fp, and let ∆ be an eﬀective Q-
divisor on S. If D − (KS + ∆) is also nef, then D is semiample.

The semiampleness is preserved under taking the pullback under a sur-

jective morphism to a normal variety.

Lemma 2.4 (cf. [Kee99, Lemma 2.10]). Let f : Y → X be a proper surjec-
tion between varieties deﬁned over an algebraically closed ﬁeld and let L be
a line bundle on X. Assume that X is normal. Then L is semiample if and
only if f ∗L is semiample.

The following technical proposition, shown in [BW], is used in the proof

of Lemma 3.1 (see Remark 3.2).

Proposition 2.5 ([BW, Lemma 3.6]). Let (X, ∆) be a three-dimensional
klt pair deﬁned over an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic larger than
ﬁve. Let C be a curve on X and let W → X be a log resolution of (X, ∆).
Then there exists a curve C ′ on W such that the induced map C ′ → X is
birational onto C.

Lastly, for convenience of the reader we state the base point free theorem

established by Birkar and Waldron.

Theorem 2.6 ([BW, Theorem 1.2]). Let (X, ∆) be a three-dimensional pro-
jective klt pair deﬁned over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k of characteristic
larger than ﬁve. Assume that D is a Q-Cartier Q-divisor such that D is nef
and D − (KX + ∆) is nef and big. Then D is semiample.

3. Proof of the main theorem

We start by showing an auxiliary lemma. For technical reasons, instead
of simply assuming that D is Cartier, we only assume that it is Q-linearly
equivalent to a Cartier divisor after taking the pullback under a birational
morphism (see Remark 3.2).

Lemma 3.1. Let (X, Θ) be a Q-factorial three-dimensional projective klt
pair deﬁned over an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic larger than
ﬁve. Let D be a nef Q-divisor, and let S be an eﬀective divisor. Fix ǫ ∈ Q>0
such that ǫ ≤ 1

7 . Further, assume that

(1) D − ǫS ∼Q KX + Θ,
(2) (1 − ǫ)S ≤ Θ, and
(3) there exists a birational morphism π : X ′ → X such that π∗D is

Q-linearly equivalent to a Cartier divisor.

Let g : X → V be a contraction of a (D − ǫS)-extremal ray R. Then there
exists a Q-Cartier Q-divisor D′ on V such that D ∼Q g∗D′.

In particular, if g is birational, then D ∼Q g∗g∗D. The main example of
a situation when the assumptions of the lemma hold, is when for a dlt pair
(X, ∆) we have: S = ⌊∆⌋, Θ = ∆ − ǫS, and D = KX + ∆ is Cartier.

ON BASE POINT FREE THEOREM FOR LC THREEFOLDS OVER Fp

5

Proof of Lemma 3.1. By a standard argument, it is enough to show that
D ≡g 0, that is, D · R = 0 (cf. [KM98, Theorem 3.7 (4)]). To this end, we
note that the nefness of D implies that R is also a (D −S)-negative extremal
ray. For Θ′ := Θ − (1 − ǫ)S, we have that

D − S ∼Q KX + Θ′,

and (X, Θ′) is klt.

By the boundedness of the lengths of extremal rays of KX + Θ′ ([BW,
Theorem 1.1 (ii)]), there exists a curve C on X which generates the (KX +
Θ′)-negative extremal ray R and satisﬁes

(D − S) · C = (KX + Θ′) · C ≥ −6.

Therefore, we obtain

0 > (D − ǫS) · C = ǫ(D − S) · C + (1 − ǫ)D · C

≥ −6ǫ + (1 − ǫ)D · C,

and hence D · C < 6ǫ

1−ǫ ≤ 1.

Without loss of generality we can assume that π : X ′ → X is a log res-
olution of singularities of (X, ∆). By Proposition 2.5, there exists a curve
C ′ on X ′ such that the restriction π|C ′ is a birational map onto C. By the
projection formula, we obtain

D · C = π∗D · C ′,

and since π∗D is Q-linearly equivalent to a Cartier divisor, we have D·C ∈ Z.
But D·C < 1, and so the nefness of D implies that D·C = 0, which completes
the proof.
(cid:3)

Now, we can proceed with the proof of the main theorem.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. First, we can assume that D is Cartier. Indeed, mD
is nef and

mD − (KX + ∆) = (m − 1)D + D − (KX + ∆)

is nef and big for any natural number m, and so without loss of generality
we can replace D by mD. Furthermore, we may assume that (X, ∆) is
Q-factorial and dlt by applying a dlt-modiﬁcation ([Bir, Theorem 1.6]) and
Lemma 2.4. Set

L := D − (KX + ∆), and S := ⌊∆⌋.

For a ﬁxed 0 < ǫ ≤ 1

7 , we consider a (D − ǫS)-MMP. We note that
D − ǫS ∼Q (KX + ∆ − ǫS) + L.

Since (X, ∆ − ǫS) is klt, and L is nef and big, there exists a Q-divisor Θ
such that

• (X, Θ) is klt,
• D − ǫS ∼Q KX + Θ, and
• (1 − ǫ)S ≤ Θ.

6

Hence, we may run a (D − ǫS)-MMP with scaling of some ample divisor and
it terminates ([BW, Theorem 1.6]):

X = X0

99K X1

f1
99K · · ·

fl−1
99K Xl =: Y.

Note that this is also a (KX + Θ)-MMP.

We set Di, Si, and Θi to be the strict transforms of D, S, and Θ on
Xi, respectively. Then each fi is either a (Di − ǫSi)-negative divisorial
contraction or a (Di − ǫSi)-ﬂip.

By subsequently applying Lemma 3.1 to Xi, Θi, Di, Si, for 0 ≤ i < l,
and the corresponding contractions, we get that this (KX + Θ)-MMP is D-
crepant, that is, there exists a resolution W of the indeterminacy of f :=

such that p∗D ∼Q q∗f∗D holds. To this end, it is suﬃcient to show induc-
tively for each i that the conditions (1), (2), (3) of Lemma 3.1 are satisﬁed
and that Di is nef. The ﬁrst two hold since the containment of divisors
and the Q-linear equivalence are preserved under taking the pushforward
under a divisorial contraction or a ﬂip. Thus, we are left to show (3) and
the nefness of Di. Since these hold clearly for i = 0, we can assume that
i > 0. Further, by induction, we can assume that f ′
i−1 := fi−1 ◦ · · · ◦ f0 is
D-crepant. In particular, there exists a commutative diagram

i Di ∼Q p∗

i D is Cartier. Hence, (3) is satisﬁed, and

Let f : X 99K Y be the end result of this MMP and let S′ and D′ be the
strict transforms of S and D on Y , respectively. Then they satisfy one of
the following properties:
(A) D′ − ǫS′ is nef, or
(B) there exists a (D′ − ǫS′)-negative extremal contraction g : Y → Z

with dim Z ≤ 2.

Since f is D-crepant, D′ is nef. Further, in order to prove the semiampleness
of D, it is suﬃcient to show the semiampleness of D′ (cf. Lemma 2.4).

We divide the argument into the cases (A) and (B).

Case (A). First, we prove that D′ − ǫS′ is semiample. Let Θ′ be the strict
transform of Θ on Y . Then (Y, Θ′) is klt and

D′ − ǫS′ ∼Q KY + Θ′.

Further, Θ′ is big, as Θ is big, and thus we can write Θ′ = Γ + A with an
eﬀective Q-divisor Γ and an ample Q-divisor A, so that (Y, Γ) is klt. Since

D′ − ǫS′ − (KY + Γ) ∼Q A

is ample, the nef Q-divisor D′ − ǫS′ turns out to be semiample by the base
point free theorem for klt pairs (Theorem 2.6).

Moreover, D′−(ǫ−δ)S′ is semiample for a suﬃciently small δ > 0. Indeed,

D′ − (ǫ − δ)S′ − (KY + Γ) ∼Q A + δS′

is ample, when δ is small enough. Further, D′ − (ǫ − δ)S′ is nef, as D′ and
D′ − ǫS′ are nef. Hence, the semiampleness of D′ − (ǫ − δ)S′ follows from
the base point free theorem (Theorem 2.6).

Let h : Y → V be the semiample ﬁbration associated to D′ − (ǫ − δ)S′

and let H be an ample Q-Cartier Q-divisor on V such that

D′ − (ǫ − δ)S′ ∼Q h∗H.

Let C be a curve contracted by h. In particular, (cid:0)D′ − (ǫ − δ)S′(cid:1) · C = 0.
Since D′ and D′ − ǫS′ are nef, we get that (D′ − ǫS′) · C = 0, and so
the semiample ﬁbration associated to D′ − ǫS′ factors through h. Hence,
D − ǫS′ can be written as a pullback under h of a Q-Cartier Q-divisor on V ,
which implies that S′ can be written as a pullback of an eﬀective Q-Cartier
Q-divisor.

Therefore, we may write

D′ ∼Q h∗(H + E)

with an ample Q-Cartier Q-divisor H and an eﬀective Q-Cartier Q-divisor
E.

If dim V ≤ 2, then the nef and big Q-divisor H + E is semiample by

Lemma 2.1 and Theorem 2.2. Hence, D′ is semiample, and so is D.

If dim V = 3, then D′ is big. Therefore, D is also big, since f is D-crepant.

In this case, the assertion is nothing but Theorem 1.1.

This completes the proof in the case (A).

Case (B). First, by Lemma 3.1, there exists a Q-Cartier Q-divisor DZ on
Z such that D′ ∼Q g∗DZ . In particular, g is S′-positive.

If dim Z ≤ 1, the nef Q-divisor DZ is semiample (Lemma 2.1). Hence, D′

is semiample, and so is D.

In what follows, we assume that dim Z = 2. Since g is S′-positive, some
1 of S′ dominates Z. Let S1 and S1 be the strict

irreducible component S′
transforms of S′

1 on X and W, respectively.

Note that S1 is normal, since (X, ∆) is dlt ([HX15, Proposition 4.1]). Hence,
by Lemma 2.4, in order to prove the semiampleness of DZ , it is suﬃcient
to show the semiampleness of DZ |S 1. Since DZ |S1 ∼Q D|S 1, it is suﬃcient
to show the semiampleness of D|S1. By adjunction, the new pair (S1, ∆S1)

deﬁned by KS1 + ∆S1 = (KX + ∆)|S1 is also dlt. Note that D|S1 and

D|S1 − (KS1 + ∆S1) ∼Q (cid:0)D − (KX + ∆)(cid:1)|S1

are nef. Therefore, the semiampleness of D|S1 follows from Theorem 2.3.
This shows that DZ is semiample, and so is D.

The proof in the case (B) is completed.

(cid:3)

Remark 3.2. The same argument as in Lemma 3.1 appears in [Kaw08]. One
diﬀerence from [Kaw08] is that we do not know whether Di is Cartier in our
case. If we worked in characteristic zero, we could prove that Di is Cartier
by the base point free theorem. The point is that the original base point
free theorem in characteristic zero is stronger: for a nef line bundle D on a
klt pair (X, ∆) satisfying that D − (KX + ∆) is nef and big, it is proved that
mD is base point free for suﬃciently large m. In positive characteristic, we
only know the base point freeness for a suﬃciently divisible m (Theorem 1.1
and Theorem 2.6). Proposition 2.5 was necessary to overcome this issue.

4. Mori dream spaces over Fp

The main goal of this section is to show Theorem 4.6, which gives a

negative answer to Question 1.3.

First, we recall the deﬁnition of a Mori dream space introduced by Hu

and Keel ([HK00]).

Deﬁnition 4.1. A normal projective variety X is called a Mori dream space
if the following three conditions hold:

(1) X is Q-factorial and Pic(X)Q = NS(X)Q,
(2) Nef(X) is an aﬃne hull of ﬁnitely many semiample line bundles, and
(3) there is a ﬁnite collection of small Q-factorial modiﬁcations fi : X 99K
Xi such that each Xi satisﬁes (2) and Mov(X) is the union of
f ∗
i (Nef(Xi)).

In this deﬁnition, a small Q-factorial modiﬁcation of a projective variety X
is a birational contraction f : X → X ′, with X ′ projective and Q-factorial,
such that f is an isomorphism in codimension one.

Remark 4.2. Note that there are many examples of Mori dream spaces which
appear only over Fp. For example, an elliptic curve E deﬁned over an
algebraically closed ﬁeld k is a Mori dream space if and only if k = Fp for
some prime number p.

4.1. Two-dimensional case. Before proceeding with the proof of Theorem
4.6, we discuss the situation in the two-dimensional case.

Assume that (X, ∆) is a two-dimensional projective log canonical pair
deﬁned over Fp. When −(KX + ∆) is nef and big, then X is a Mori dream
space by the following proposition.

Proposition 4.3. Let X be a normal projective surface deﬁned over Fp such
that −KX is big. Then X is a Mori dream space.

Proof. First, by [Tan14, Theorem 4.5], a normal projective surface deﬁned
over Fp is always Q-factorial. Further, a numerically trivial line bundle
on a projective variety deﬁned over Fp is always torsion (cf. [Kee99, Lemma

ON BASE POINT FREE THEOREM FOR LC THREEFOLDS OVER Fp

9

2.16]), and so Pic(X)Q = NS(X)Q. Thus, by deﬁnition, it is enough to verify
that the nef cone of X is a rational polyhedron and any nef line bundle is
semiample.

In order to prove the ﬁrst assertion, write −KX ∼Q A+ E for some ample
Q-divisor A and a Q-eﬀective Q-divisor E. Then, the cone of eﬀective curves
is a rational polyhedron by Tanaka’s cone theorem ([Tan14, Theorem 3.13])
applied to KX + E, and so its dual cone, the nef cone Nef(X), is a rational
polyhedron as well.

As for the second assertion, take any nef divisor D on X. Then

D − (KX + E) ∼Q A + D

is ample, and so D is semiample by Theorem 2.3 (see also [Tan14, Theorem
4.15]). This concludes the proof.
(cid:3)

Remark 4.4. For any algebraically closed ﬁeld k, it is known that a smooth
projective rational surface with big anticanonical divisor −KX is a Mori
dream space ([TVAV11]).

Note that the answer to Question 1.3 is negative even in dimension two,

when X is deﬁned over an algebraically closed ﬁeld diﬀerent from Fp.

Proposition 4.5. For any algebraically closed ﬁeld k diﬀerent from Fp,
there exists a log canonical projective two-dimensional pair (X, ∆) deﬁned
over k, such that −(KX + ∆) is nef and big, but not every nef line bundle
on X is semiample. In particular, X is not a Mori dream space.

Proof. The construction is based on Cutkosky’s example (see [Laz04, Section
2.3.B]). Take an elliptic curve C, a point P ∈ C, and a numerically trivial
but non-torsion divisor D (here we need the assumption k 6= Fp). Let
X = ProjC(OC (−P ) ⊕ OC (D)), let π : X → C be the natural projection,
and let F = π∗(P ).

By [Har77, Ch. V. Corollary 2.11], we have −KX ≡ 2C0 + F , where C0
is the canonical section. Take ∆ = C0. Then −(KX + ∆) ≡ C0 + F is a nef
divisor. Further, it is big, as (C0 + F )2 = 1. However, C0 + F cannot be
semiample, because if it was, then the associated semiample ﬁbration would
contract C0, but (C0 + F )|C0 = (π∗D)|C0 is non-torsion. Hence, X is not a
Mori dream space.
(cid:3)

4.2. Three-dimensional case. In this subsection, we give a negative an-
swer to Question 1.3:

Theorem 4.6. For any algebraically closed ﬁeld k, there exists a log canoni-
cal projective three-dimensional pair (X, ∆) deﬁned over k, such that −(KX +
∆) is nef and big, but the nef cone Nef(X) is not a rational polyhedron. In
particular, X is not a Mori dream space.

The example is constructed by taking a blow-up of a projective cone of
a K3 surface which is not a Mori dream space. We would like to express
our gratitude to Professors Yoshinori Gongyo and Keiji Oguiso for their
suggesting the way of constructing the example.

Proposition 4.7. For any algebraically closed ﬁeld k, there exists a K3
surface S deﬁned over k whose nef cone Nef(S) is not a rational polyhedron.
In particular, S is not a Mori dream space.

10

YUSUKE NAKAMURA AND JAKUB WITASZEK

For any algebraically closed ﬁeld k, it is known that there exists a K3
surface S deﬁned over k which has an inﬁnite automorphism group (see
[Uen86, Corollary] and [DK03, Theorem 1.1], for instance). Therefore,
Proposition 4.7 follows from the following proposition, whose proof was sug-
gested to us by K. Oguiso.

Proposition 4.8. Let S be a K3 surface deﬁned over an algebraically closed
ﬁeld k. If the nef cone Nef(S) of S is a rational polyhedron, then the auto-
morphism group Aut(S) is ﬁnite.

Proof. Let l1, . . . , lc be primitive elements of NS(S) such that R≥0li for 1 ≤
i ≤ c are the extremal rays of Nef(S). As Aut(S) acts on Nef(S), it also
acts on the set {li}1≤i≤c. Let G be the ﬁnite group of automorphisms of this
set {li}1≤i≤c, which is isomorphic to the c-th symmetric group.

The above paragraph implies that there is a natural map Aut(S) → G.
It is enough to show that its kernel K is ﬁnite. To this end, note that
H 0(S, TS ) = 0, and so K ⊆ Aut(S) is discrete. Furthermore, K acts as the
identity on Pic(S), due to the fact that NS(S) = Pic(S).

Take any very ample divisor H, and let S ⊆ PN be the embedding induced
by it. Since K acts as the identity on Pic(S), the group K preserves H, and
so K preserves the embedding S ⊆ PN . In particular, K ⊆ PGLN +1(k). As
K is discrete and PGLN +1(k) is Noetherian, the group K must be ﬁnite. (cid:3)

Now, we can proceed with the proof of the main theorem of this section.

Proof of Theorem 4.6. Let S be a K3 surface whose nef cone Nef(S) is not
a rational polyhedron (Proposition 4.7). Choose an ample line bundle A on
S, and embed S into a projective space PN via some multiple of A, so that
S ⊆ PN is projectively normal.

Let X ⊆ PN +1 be the projective cone of S ⊆ PN , and let X be the
blow-up of X at the vertex of the cone. We have the following morphisms:

f

/ X

X

p

S,

where p : X → S is the natural P1-bundle on S. Note that f is a resolution
of singularities of X, and its exceptional divisor E is isomorphic to S by
p|E.

Set ∆ := E. Then, by [Gon12, Section 5.1], we have that −(KX + ∆) is
nef and big. Further, note that Pic(X) = NS(X). Indeed, any numerically
trivial line bundle L on X descends to S by the Grauert theorem ([Har77, Ch.
III. Corollary 12.9]), and any numerically trivial line bundle on a K3 surface
is trivial.

Let F ≃ P1 be a general ﬁbre of p. Consider a subcone

{D ∈ Nef(X) | D · F = 0} ⊆ Nef(X).

By the above paragraph, this subcone is isomorphic to Nef(S), and hence
In particular, Nef(X) is not a rational
it is not a rational polyhedron.
polyhedron, and X is not a Mori dream space.

Remark 4.9. Let (X, ∆) be a log canonical projective three-dimensional pair
deﬁned over Fp. Let D be a big and nef Q-Cartier Q-divisor on X. Let

NE(X)|<(KX +∆+D)

be the cone of eﬀective curves C satisfying C · (KX + ∆ + D) < 0. When
(X, ∆) is klt, then NE(X)|<(KX +∆+D) is a rational polyhedron by the cone
theorem. Hence, it is natural to ask whether this still holds without the klt
assumption. Unfortunately, Theorem 4.6 shows that this is not the case,
and so the cone theorem does not extend to a setting similar to the one of
Theorem 1.2.
