Abstract: In this paper we consider quantum walks whose evolution converges to the Dirac equation
one in the limit of small wave-vectors. We show exact Fast Fourier implementation of the Dirac
quantum walks in one, two and three space dimensions. The behaviour of particle states, deﬁned as
states smoothly peaked in some wave-vector eigenstate of the walk, is described by an approximated
dispersive differential equation that for small wave-vectors gives the usual Dirac particle and
antiparticle kinematics. The accuracy of the approximation is provided in terms of a lower bound
on the ﬁdelity between the exactly evolved state and the approximated one. The jittering of the
position operator expectation value for states having both a particle and an antiparticle component is
analytically derived and observed in the numerical implementations.

1. Introduction

Thinking about the discrete evolution of physical systems, the most natural example is certainly
a particle moving on a lattice. A (classical) random walk is exactly the description of a particle which
moves in discrete time steps and with certain probabilities from one lattice position to the neighboring
lattice positions. These models have gained increasing attention showing several applications in the
ﬁelds of mathematics, physics, chemistry, computer science, natural sciences and economics [1–3].
A quantum version of such a random walk, denoted quantum walk (QW), was ﬁrst introduced in [4]
where the motion (right or left) of a spin-1/2 particle is decided by a measurement of the z-component
of its spin. Subsequently, the measurement was replaced by a unitary operator on the internal space,
also known as coin space [5,6], determining the evolution of the internal degree of freedom of the
system. This model, known as coined quantum walk, has been proven to provide a computational
speedup over classical random walks for a class of problems, such as some oracular problems, element
distinctness problem, triangle ﬁnding problem; the Grover’s search algorithm can also be implemented
as a QW [7–13]. The rigorous deﬁnition of QW can be found in Refs. [6,14] for the one-dimensional
case, and in [5] for QWs on graphs of any dimension (see also [15] for a complete review including
walks with continuous time evolution not considered in the present context).

Beside the interest in quantum algorithms QWs provide a fully quantum model of evolution
for a system with an internal degree of freedom and as such QWs have been considered as discrete
quantum simulator for particle-physics. Interestingly it has been proven that QWs have the capability

of simulating free relativistic particle dynamics [16–27] providing, in contrast with other discretisation
schemes based on ﬁnite-differences and which in general do not preserve the norm, a local unitary
model underlying relativistic dynamics.

In the light of this success, in Ref. [28] the authors propose a discrete theory for quantum
ﬁeld dynamics based on ﬁnite dimensional quantum systems in interaction. Assuming the locality,
homogeneity and unitarity of the interaction it follows that the systems must evolve according to a
QW. Moreover, the above assumptions results to be very restrictive and the only QWs admissible on
the cubic lattice in one, two and three dimensions are proved to recover the usual relativistic Weyl
equation in the limit of small wave-vectors. The massive case is obtained coupling two massless QWs
and in other works also the Maxwell equation [29] for Bosonic ﬁelds is proved to be compatible with
an elementary QW model. Finally the Lorentz covariance, which is broken by the discreteness of
the walk, can be recovered as an approximated symmetry [30] in the relativistic limit. These results
show how QWs not only provide a useful way for simulating relativistic free evolution but also can be
considered as a fundamental approach to quantum ﬁeld theory (see Refs. [31,32] for a review).

Here we consider the Dirac QWs derived in Ref. [28] and present both an analytical and a

numerical study of their kinematics recovering the characteristic traits of the usual Dirac equation.

We show “smooth-states” peaked around some wave-vector eigenstate of the QW can be
considered as particle states. We present an analytical approximation of particle states evolution
deriving a wave-vector-dependent differential equation for the walk evolution. Then we analyse in
the details dynamical quantities as the walk position and velocity operators and study their evolution.
An intrinsic relativistic quantum processes of the Dirac ﬁeld, denoted Zitterbewegung, ﬁrst considered
by Schrödinger [33] and corresponding to a jittering of the mean position for a relativistic particle, is
recovered from the QW evolution. The theoretical existence of the quivering motion has been evidenced
by numerical simulations of the Dirac equation and of quantum ﬁeld theory. While Zitterbewegung
oscillations cannot be directly observed by current experimental techniques for a Dirac electron since
the amplitude should by very small (equal to the Compton wavelength ¯h/mc with m the rest mass
of the relativistic particle, namely ≈ 10−12 m for an electron), solid state and atomic physics provide
physical hardwares to simulate the phenomenon [34–50] and have recently boosted a renewed interest
in the Dirac equation features.

2. Quantum walks

A quantum walk is a local unitary evolution of a quantum system with Hilbert space H =
(cid:96)2(V) ⊗ Cs, where V is a countable set and Cs is called coin space, namely the internal degree of
freedom of the walker, s > 0 integer.
A QW on H is deﬁned by assigning a mapping E : V × V → Ms(C), such that E (x, y) := Uy,x,
which associates to each pair of vertices a matrix, called transition matrix, acting on the coin space.
Then ψ : N → H is a solution of the QW (V,E ) if it satisﬁes the following update rule for a given
initial condition ψ(0) ∈ H:

ψ(x, t + 1) = ∑
y∈V

E (y, x)ψ(y, t),

∀x ∈ V, ∀t ∈ N,

(1)

where ψ(x, t) ∈ Cs is the QW wave-function. Such a QW carries an associated graph deﬁned by the
set of non-null transition matrices as the directed graph Γ = (V, E) with vertex set V and edge set
E := { (x, y) ∈ V × V | Ay,x (cid:54)= 0}. The locality condition amounts to requiring that for every vertex
x = { y ∈ V | Uy,x (cid:54)= 0}, and in-neighbourhood
x ∈ V the cardinality of its out-neighbourhood N +
N −
x = { y ∈ V | Ux,y (cid:54)= 0} is uniformly bounded over V, namely |N ±
x | < M < +∞ for every x ∈ V.
In Ref. [28] it has been shown that assuming the QW homogeneous (the vertices of the graph
cannot be distinguished by the walk dynamics) the graph Γ is actually a Cayley graph of a group G.
Given a group G and taking S ⊆ G, the Cayley graph Γ(G, S) of G with connection set S is deﬁned
as the coloured directed graph (G, S, E) with vertex set G, edge set E := { (g, gh) | g ∈ G, h ∈ S } and

Version March 22, 2016 submitted to Entropy

colouring given by E (cid:51) (g, g(cid:48)) (cid:55)→ g−1g(cid:48) ∈ S. We will assume hereafter that the connection set S is
a generating set for G—which entails that the Cayley graph Γ(G, S) is unilaterally connected—and
it is symmetric, namely S = S−1. The walk unitary operator corresponding to the update rule of
Eq. (1) can be expressed in terms of the right-regular representation of G on (cid:96)2(G) deﬁned as the map
G (cid:51) g (cid:55)→ Tg ∈ Aut((cid:96)2(G)) such that Tg |g(cid:48)(cid:105) = |g(cid:48)g−1(cid:105). Assuming, by homogeneity, that we can choose
the transition matrices independently of the vertex so that Ug,gh ≡ Uh for every g ∈ G and h ∈ S, we
can write the walk operator U ∈ Aut(H) as

U = ∑
h∈S

Th ⊗ Uh.

2.1. Fourier representation of Abelian QWs

As pointed out by Ambainis et al. [6], there are two general ways to study the evolution of a QW.
On the one hand, one can exploit the algebraic properties of the walk transition matrixes to obtain a
path-sum solution, where the QW transition amplitude to a given site is expressed as a combinatorial
sum over all the paths leading to that site. Regarding this approach, in Ref. [6] the authors provided
a solution for the Hadamard Walk; whereas Konno derived the solution for an arbitrary coined QW
[51]. Considering the application of QWs to the description of relativistic particles, also the Dirac QW
in 1 + 1-dimensions and the massless Dirac QW in 2 + 1-dimensions have been analytically solved
in position space [52,53]. On the other hand, when the a QW is deﬁned on the Cayley graph of an
Abelian group the walk dynamics can be studied in its Fourier representation, providing analytical
solutions and also approximate asymptotic solutions in the long-time limit.
Let us now consider QWs deﬁned on Cayley graphs of free Abelian groups, that is G ∼= Zd with
generating set S. Adopting the usual additive notation for the group operation on Zd, the right-regular
representation of Zd is expressed as

Ty |x(cid:105) = |x − y(cid:105) ,

∀x, y ∈ Zd.

(3)

Moreover it decomposes in one-dimensional irreducible representations, as can be easily seen from the
fact that the translations Tx are diagonal on the plane waves

e−ik·x |x(cid:105) , Tx |k(cid:105) = e−ik·x |k(cid:105) ,

(4)

|k(cid:105) :=

x∈Zd

U =

where B denotes the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, which depends on the speciﬁc Cayley graph Γ(Zd, S) we are
considering.

Therefore we can write the walk operator of Eq. (2) in the direct integral decomposition

|k(cid:105)(cid:104)k| ⊗ Uk dk,

Uk := ∑
h∈S

e−ik·hUh.

(5)

For each k we can diagonalise the matrix Uk obtaining

(6)
where ωr(k) is the dispersion relation of the walk and |ur(k)(cid:105) ∈ Cs is the eigenvector of Uk
corresponding to the eigenvalue e−iωr(k), with r = 1, . . . , s.

Uk |ur(k)(cid:105) = e−iωr(k) |ur(k)(cid:105) ,

3. The Dirac QW in one, two and three space dimensions

In This Section we present the Dirac QWs in one, two and three space dimensions derived in
Ref. [28]. We will see that in the limit of small wave-vectors the Dirac walks simulate the usual Dirac
equation evolution. We start from the simplest case of massless Dirac QW, also denote Weyl QW. The

massive walk will be given by coupling two Weyl QWs with the coupling parameter interpreted a
posteriori as the mass of the Dirac ﬁeld.

3.1. The Weyl quantum walk

In Ref. [28] the authors derive the unique QWs on Cayley graphs of Zd for d = 1, 2, 3
satisfying—besides locality and unitarity—the assumptions of homogeneity and discrete isotropy
and with minimal dimension s of the coin space to have non-identical evolution. As ﬁrst noticed by
Meyer [18], the only solution for scalar QWs on Cayley graphs of free-Abelian groups is the identical
QW; in order to have non-trivial dynamics one has to take at least s = 2.

Let us start from Cayley graphs of Z3, the most relevant from the physical perspective. It can be
proved (see [28]) that only the body-centred cubic lattice (BCC) allows one to deﬁne a QW satisfying the
above assumptions. The BCC lattice is the Cayley graph Γ(Z3, S+ ∪ S−) where S+ = {h1, h2, h3, h4}
is the set of generators of the group and S− is the corresponding set of their inverses; a convenient
choice for the generators is the following:

The ﬁrst Brillouin zone B of the BCC lattice is deﬁned in Cartesian coordinates as −π ≤ ki ± kj ≤
π, i (cid:54)= j, i, j ∈ {x, y, z} and it is depicted in Fig. 1.

The unique solutions on the BCC lattice can be summarised as:

Uk = ukI − iσ · ˜nk,

sxcycz − cxsysz

cxsycz + sxcysz
cxcysz − sxsycz

 ,

˜nk :=

uk := cxcycz + sxsysz,

ci := cos ki,

si := sin ki.

(8)

where σ is the vectors with components given by the Pauli matrices σx, σy and σz. The walk matrix Uk
has spectrum {e−iωk, eiωk} with dispersion relation ωk = arccos uk and group velocity vk := ∇kωk,
representing the speed of a wave-packet peaked around the central wave-vector k.
Let us consider now d = 2; also in this case our assumptions single out only one Cayley graph
of Z2, the square lattice, involving two generators S+ = {h1, h2}, with h1 = (1, 0) and h2 = (0, 1);

Version March 22, 2016 submitted to Entropy

5 of 17

the ﬁrst Brillouin zone B in this case is given by −π ≤ ki ≤ π, i ∈ {x, y}, where kx = k1 + k2 and
ky = k1 − k2. The unitary matrix of the walk in Fourier representation is given by:

Uk = ukI − iσ · ˜nk,

 ,

sxcy

cxsy
sxsy

˜nk :=

uk := cxcy,

ci := cos ki,

si := sin ki,

(9)

with dispersion relation ωk = arccos uk.
Finally, for d = 1 the unique Cayley graph satisfying our requirements for Z is the lattice Z itself,
considered as the free Abelian group on one generator S+ = {h}. From the unitarity conditions one
gets the unique solution

Uk = uk I − iσ · ˜nk,

uk := cos k,

˜nk :=

 0

0

 ,

sin k

(10)

(11)

(12)

with dispersion relation ωk = k.

From Equations (8) to (10) we see that the Weyl QW in dimension d ≤ 3 is of the form

Wk = ukI − iσ · ˜nk,

for certain uk and nk with dispersion relation

ωk = arccos uk.

Now it is easy to show that the evolution of the walks Equations (8) to (10) obeys the Weyl’s equation
in the limit of small wave-vectors and thus we call them Weyl QWs. Let us introduce the interpolating
Hamiltonian HW (k) deﬁned in the wave-vector space as the matrix such that Wk = e−i HW (k) and
governing the continuous-time evolution, interpolating exactly the discrete dynamics of the walk. As
one can check the interpolating Hamiltonian is

HW (k) = ωkσ · nk,

nk :=

1

sin ωk

˜nk,

(13)

and by power expanding at the ﬁrst order in k one has

(14)
whose ﬁrst order term σ · k coincides with the usual Weyl Hamiltonian in d dimensions, with d = 1, 2, 3,
once the wave-vector k is interpreted as the momentum.

HW (k) = σ · k + O(|k|2)

It will be useful for the considerations of the following sections, to consider the eigenvectors of the
QW. Since the structure of the matrix is independent of the dimension, we will give here the general
expression of the eigenvectors. Let us now rewrite the unitary matrix Wk as:

(cid:32)

(cid:33)

Wk =

zk −w∗

wk
k

k

,

(15)

where zk and wk are related to the functions in Eq. (11) by the equations Re(zk) = uk and ˜nk =
(− Im(wk), Re(wk),− Im(zk)). We can then solve the eigenvalue problem

Wk |uW

s (k)(cid:105) = e−isωk |uW

3.2. The massive case

,

(17)

Now we present QWs which manifest Dirac dynamics. We consider a walk resulting from the
local coupling of two Weyl QWs. One can show [28] that there is only one possible local coupling of
two Weyl QWs and that in the small wave-vector limit the resulting walks approximate the Dirac’s
equation. The unique local coupling of Weyl’s QWs, modulo unitary conjugation, is of the form

n, m ∈ R+,

,

n2 + m2 = 1.

(18)

(cid:32)

(cid:33)

Dk =

We can provide a convenient expression of the walk in terms of the gamma matrices in spinorial
representation:

where uk and ˜nk are those given previously for the Weyl’s QWs. From Eq. (19) we can see that the
dispersion relation in this case is simply given by

Dk = nukI − inγ0γ · ˜nk + imγ0,
(cid:17)

(cid:16)(cid:112)

1 − m2 uk

.

ωk = arccos

In this case the interpolating Hamiltonian HD(k) has the form

HD(k) =

ωk

sin ωk

(nγ0γ · ˜nk − mγ0)

and to the ﬁrst order in k and m one obtains the usual Dirac’s Hamiltonian
HD(k) = γ0γ · k + mγ0 + O(m2) + O(|k|2).

It is worth noticing that in dimension d = 1 the Dirac QW decouples into two identical s = 2 massive
QWs [22,28], written explicitly as

4. Numerical simulation of the Weyl and Dirac QWs

In order to evaluate numerically the evolution of QWs one can adopt two different approaches.
On the one hand, one can exploit the update rule in position space given by Eq. (1), which is
straightforward to implement numerically. This approach, however, is not very efﬁcient if we only
want to know the evolved state at some speciﬁc time t, since it would require t successive updates of
the state. On the other hand, the Fourier representation of the walk allows one to compute directly the
evolution at a speciﬁc time, the complexity of the computation being that of the Fourier Transform,
which can be efﬁciently implemented via a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, such as the
Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm [54].
Recalling the general expressions in Eqs. (5) and (6), the evolution of a state |ψ(0)(cid:105) ∈ H =
(cid:96)2(Zd) ⊗ Cs is given by the subsequent application of the walk unitary |ψ(t)(cid:105) = Ut |ψ(0)(cid:105). Therefore
the state at time t can be expressed in terms of its representation in Fourier space as the Fourier
Transform

|ψ(x, t)(cid:105) =

1

(2π)d/2

s∑

r=1

e−ik·xe−iωr(k)t ˆψr(k) |ur(k)(cid:105) dk,

|ψ(x, t)(cid:105) ∈ Cs, x ∈ Zd,

(26)

B

where ˆψr(k) = ∑x∈G (cid:104)ur(k)|ψ(x, 0)(cid:105) eik·x is the r-component in the eigenbasis of the walk of the
discrete-time Fourier transform of |ψ(x, 0)(cid:105). Now, the data used to represent the state in Fourier space
ki with ki = −(cid:98)Ni/2(cid:99), . . . ,(cid:100)Ni/2(cid:101) − 1 and Ni
constitute a discrete sampling of it, say at frequencies 2π
Ni
the total number of samples in dimension i. This amounts to take samples in direct space over a ﬁnite
region, extending the data periodically to the whole lattice.
Let us consider now the simple cubic lattice of Zd. Let us consider a restriction f : Zd → C
of ϕ ∈ (cid:96)2(Zd) to a ﬁnite region N = { m ∈ Zd | 0 ≤ mi < Ni, i = 1, . . . , d }, with Ni ∈ N, such that
f|N = ϕ|N . Then f|N is periodically extended to Zd, namely fn+Nr = fn, ∀n, r ∈ Zd, with periodicity
matrix given by N = diag(N1, . . . , Nd). The Fourier Transform F of the sequence fn coincides with
the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) deﬁned as

(cid:90)

ˆfk = DFT( f )(k) :=

1√

fne−2πip(cid:124)N−1ne2πik(cid:124)N−1n, k ∈ N ,

∑
n∈N

where N = |N| = det(N) and pi =

(27)

(28)

Here we have chosen the set of Fourier indices k so that the frequencies actually computed lie in the
interval [−π, π].

For the Dirac QW in 3 + 1-dimensions we have to consider instead the BCC lattice. One can
show [55] that it is possible to reduce the DFT on the BCC lattice to two rectangular DFTs, allowing to
implement the DFT via usual rectangular FFT algorithms. We can describe the BCC lattice choosing

Version March 22, 2016 submitted to Entropy

as vertex set G = 2Z3 ∪ (2Z3 + t), where t = (1, 1, 1). A suitable truncation of a sequence ϕn, n ∈ G,
to a function fn deﬁned on a ﬁnite set B ⊂ G can be obtained choosing the fundamental region
B = 2N ∪ (2N + t) and periodically extending it to G. The original sequence fn can be further split
n = f2n+t, for all n ∈ N . As a

where the set of Fourier indices can be chosen as K = (cid:8) k ∈ Z3(cid:12)(cid:12) −Ni ≤ ki < Ni, i = 1, 2, 3(cid:9). As

shown in Ref. [55], one can exploit the geometry of the BCC lattice to reduce the DFT ˆfk with k ∈ K to
k with k restricted now to N . This allows for the computation of the DFT in
two functions ˆf 0

5. Kinematics of the Dirac QW

Here we study the kinematics of the Dirac QW presented in Section 3. We show that there exists a
class of states whose evolution resembles the evolution of a particle with a given wave-vector. Their
evolution can be described by an approximated differential equation with coefﬁcients depending on
the particle wave-vector. We observe that the positive and negative frequency eigenstates of the walk
correspond to Dirac particle and antiparticle states.

Finally we consider the position operator for the Dirac QW and ﬁnd that the mean position of states
having both positive and negative frequency components present the typical jittering phenomenon,
denoted Zitterbewegung, of relativistic particles. The Zitterbewegung was ﬁrst discovered by Schrödinger
in 1930 [56] who pointed out that in the Dirac equation for free relativistic electrons the velocity operator
does not commute with the Dirac Hamiltonian. As a consequence the evolution of the position operator
shows, in addition to the classical motion proportional to the group velocity, a fast periodic oscillation
with frequency 2mc2 and amplitude equal to the Compton wavelength ¯h/mc with m the rest mass of
the relativistic particle. This oscillating motion is due [57] to the interference of states corresponding to
the positive and negative energies ﬁrstly appeared as solutions to the Dirac equation. The trembling is
also shown to disappear with time [58] for a wave-packet particle state. The same phenomenology is
recovered in the Dirac QW scenario that also presents solutions having positive and negative frequency
eigenvalues.

5.1. Approximated dispersive differential equation

We denote a quantum state of the walker a particle state if it is localized in a region of the lattice
at a given instant of time and if the walk evolution preserves its localization. Accordingly we take the
following deﬁnition

Version March 22, 2016 submitted to Entropy

Deﬁnition 1 (Particle-state). A particle-state for the Dirac QW is a state smoothly peaked around some
eigenvector |u(k)(cid:105) of the walk, namely for given k(cid:48)

In the next Proposition we derive a dispersive differential equation governing the evolution for
particle-states and which makes clear their particle behaviour. It will be convenient to work with the
continuous time t, interpolating exactly the discrete walk evolution At. Accordingly we consider x, t
to be real-valued continuous variable by extending the Fourier transform

to real x, t. Since the walk is band limited in momenta k ∈ B, then the continuous function ψ(x, t) is
completely deﬁned by its value on the discrete points (x, t) of the walk causal network (the sampling
of a band-limited function is stated in the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem). However, all numerical
results will be given only for the discrete t, namely for repeated applications of the walk unitary
operator, and for discrete lattice sites x.

Proposition 1 (Dispersive differential equation). Consider the evolution of the Dirac QW of Section 3 on a
particle-state as in Deﬁnition 1. Then for any positive integer n, the state at time t is given by

|ψ(x, t)(cid:105) = ei(k(cid:48)·x−ωk(cid:48) t) | ˜ϕ(x, t)(cid:105) − ε − γΣn+1t − O(Σn+3)t,

where | ˜ϕ(x, t)(cid:105) is solution of the following differential equation

Proof. First we notice that at time t the particle-state in the momentum representation is simply
|ψ(k, t)(cid:105) = e−iωkt |ψ(k, 0)(cid:105) = e−iωktgk(cid:48) (k, 0) |u(k)(cid:105), while in the position representation it is
dk ei(K·x−Ωkt)gk(cid:48) (k, 0) |u(k)(cid:105) ,

|ψ(x, t)(cid:105) := ei(k(cid:48)x−ωr(k(cid:48))t) |ϕ(x, t)(cid:105) ,

Now we take the time derivative of |ϕ(x, t)(cid:105) and expand Ω vs k in k(cid:48). The coefﬁcients of the expansion
can be regarded as derivatives with respect to the space coordinates and taken out of the integral
(dominated derivative theorem) leading to the following dispersive differential equation

(42)

where α = (αx, αy, αz) is a multiindex and |α| = αx + αy + αz. If we truncate the above expansion at
the nth order and denote by | ˜ϕ(x, t)(cid:105) the solution of the corresponding truncated differential equation,
with the identiﬁcation of the initial condition | ˜ϕ(x, 0)(cid:105) = |ϕ(x, 0)(cid:105), we get the approximate state (41) at
time t

| ˜ψ(x, t)(cid:105) = ei(k(cid:48)·x−ωk(cid:48) t) | ˜ϕ(x, t)(cid:105) .

(43)

Using the deﬁnition of particle-state in Deﬁnition 1 one can compute the accuracy of the approximation
(43) in terms of the parameters σx, σy, σz and ε evaluating the overlap between the states (41) and (43),

Therefore the exact state |ψ(x, t)(cid:105) at time t can be approximated by(43) with the accuracy given by the
overlap (5.1). (cid:4)

A typical application of the above proposition is the second order approximation of the state

evolution. In that case Eq. (38) gives

Dk = ∇k∇kωk

where vk and Dk are respectively to drift vector and to the diffusion tensor for the particle state.
Accordingly the state will translate with group velocity given by the drift vector and its distribution in
space will spread as described by the diffusion tensor.

In Fig. 2 we show the numerical evolution (see Section 4) of a Gaussian particle-state in 3 + 1

dimensions.

m = 0.02, mean wave-vector k(cid:48) = (0, 0.01, 0), width σi = σ = 32−1 for i = x, y, z. Evolution in time is
shown as a colour gradient from light to dark; one can notice the spreading of the wave-packet as time
increases. Probability distribution shown at times t = 0, 50, 100, 150.

show the probability distribution at times t = 0, 8, 16, from left to right. In this case the mass parameter
is m = 0.03 and the spinor in the canonical basis is (1, 0, 0, 0).

5.2. The evolution of the QW position operator

Up to now we have considered only smooth-states (see Deﬁnition 1) whose walk evolution is well
described by the approximate differential equation derived in Proposition 1. On the other hand in the
QW framework are allowed to consider states very far apart from the smooth-ones and in the limit
one can also consider perfectly localized states as |ψ(cid:105) = |x(cid:105) |ζ(cid:105) with x ∈ Zd and |ζ(cid:105) = ∑ν cν |ν(cid:105) ∈ C4,
∑ν |cν|2 = 1, where |ν(cid:105), = ν = 1, . . . 4 denote the C4 basis vectors corresponding to the Dirac ﬁeld
representation in Eq. . One can see in Figs. 3 and 4 the numerical evolution (see Section 4) of a perfectly
localised state, according to the Dirac QW in 3 + 1-dimensions. The position operator X providing
the representation |x(cid:105), namely the operator such that X |x(cid:105) |ζ(cid:105) = x |x(cid:105) |ζ(cid:105), is X = ∑x∈Zd x(|x(cid:105)(cid:104)x| ⊗ I).
Accordingly the average position for an arbitrary one-particle state |ψ(cid:105) = ∑x,ν gν(x) |x(cid:105) |ν(cid:105), is given by
(cid:104)ψ|X|ψ(cid:105).

The deﬁnition of the mechanical momentum would need an interacting theory allowing
momentum exchange between different particles. However, in Section 3 we have seen that for
small k and m, the wave-vector k (namely the conjugated variable of x via the Fourier transform)
corresponds to the Dirac particle momentum. Moreover the momentum operator should correspond
to the generator of translations over the lattice. Therefore, as conjugated momentum we take the

where |ψ(cid:105) = ∑x,ν gν(x) |x(cid:105) |ν(cid:105) is a generic state and g(k) the discrete Fourier transform of g(x). We
notice that Eq. (46) differs from the usual canonical commutation relation by a boundary term, in
agreement with the existence of perfectly localized states for the walk |x(cid:105) |ζ(cid:105) = ∑y ν gν(y) |y(cid:105) |ν(cid:105),
gν(y) = cνδxy for which the expectation value in Eq. (46) vanishes. In the following evolution of the
position expectation value we will consider states having negligible boundary term in (46).
The evolution of the position operator X(t) = U−tXUt can be computed via the velocity and the

acceleration operators derived by the commutator with the walk Hamiltonian

Now we can derive the analytical expression of X(t) by doubly integrating the acceleration

The operator ˆV in Eqs. (52) and (53) is the classical component of the velocity operator which,
in the Hamiltonian diagonal basis (60), is proportional to the group velocity ˆV(k) ∝ (σz ⊗ I)vk. In
addition to the classical contribution ˆVt, we see that the position operator (53) presents, as in the usual
Dirac theory, a time dependent component ZX(t) and a constant shift term ZX(0). Since have

with Re denoting the real part. The ﬁrst two terms x±

of the particle and antiparticle components of the initial state |ψ(cid:105), which evolve independently
according to the classical component ˆV of the velocity operator. The interference between positive and
ψ (t) in Eq. (58). Obviously in case of |ψ(cid:105) having only
negative frequencies is responsible for the term xint

two contributes: a constant shift and a time dependent term. Taking for example a superposition of

where |u±,p(k)(cid:105) are the Dirac walk eigenvectors of Eq. (25). One can show that the time dependent
contribution is an oscillating term that for t → ∞ goes to 0 as 1/
t, and whose amplitude is bounded
by 1/m—say by the Compton wavelength ¯h/mc in the usual dimensional units (see Ref [23] for the
proof in one space dimension). Accordingly xint
ψ (t) can be considered as the QW analogue of the so
called Zitterbewegung.

In Figs. 5 and 6 we show two numerical examples (see Section 4) of mean position evolution for
the Dirac QW in one and three space dimensions respectively. In the ﬁrst case one can also notice the
time-damping of the jittering amplitudes.

Remark 1 (Newton-Wigner position operator evolution). As in QFT, one can deﬁne the Newton-Wigner
position operator XNW which does not mix states with positive and negative eigenvalues. Given
the operator WFW providing the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation of the Dirac walk, namely the
representation in which the Hamiltonian H(k) is diagonal

(60)

(61)

(62)

the Newton-Wigner rotated position operator is deﬁned as

XNW = W−1

FWXWFW.

As in the usual QFT the Newton-Wigner position operator (62) does not suffer the jittering of the mean
position even for states having both a particle and an antiparticle component. Indeed, in this case, the
velocity operator

VNW(t) = i[H, XNW(t)],

V(k) = ˆV(k),

(63)

corresponds to the classical component of the velocity operator in Eq. (52) and leads to a null
acceleration A(t) = i[H, VNW(t)] = 0. By integrating (63) we see that the time evolution of the
Newton-Wigner position operator XNW(t) is simply

XNW(t) = XNW(0) + ˆVt.
