We show that eﬀective ﬁeld theory techniques can be eﬃciently used to compute

power corrections to the hard thermal loops (HTL) in a high temperature T ex-

pansion. To this aim, we use the recently proposed on-shell eﬀective ﬁeld theory

(OSEFT), which describes the quantum ﬂuctuations around on-shell degrees of free-

dom. We provide the OSEFT Lagrangian up to third order in the energy expansion

for QED, and use it for the computation of power corrections to the retarded photon

polarization tensor for soft external momenta. Here soft denotes a scale of order

eT , where e is the gauge coupling constant. We develop the necessary techniques to

perform these computations, and study the contributions to the polarization tensor

proportional to e2T 2, e2T and e2T 0. The ﬁrst one describes the HTL contribution,

the second one vanishes, while the third one provides corrections of order e2 to the

soft photon propagation. We check that the results agree with the direct calculation

from QED, up to local pieces, as expected in an eﬀective ﬁeld theory.

INTRODUCTION

2

The physics of QED and QCD plasmas at high temperature T is extremely rich [1]. In

the early 90’s it was discovered that the soft energy and momentum scales of these plasmas,

where soft denotes a scale of order eT , and e is the gauge coupling constant, are properly

described by the so called Hard Thermal Loop (HTL) eﬀective ﬁeld theory. HTLs were ﬁrst

found out by extracting from one-loop Feynman diagrams their leading behavior for soft

external momenta [2–4], which arises from the contribution of the so called hard scales (of

order T ) circulating in the loop. For soft scales, they are as relevant as the bare propagators

or vertices of the theory, and HTLs have to be resummed. Although diﬀerent derivations

of the HTL diagrams were given, it was soon realized that they could be understood in

terms of the classical propagation of the on-shell particles of the QED or QCD plasmas

[5–7]. The HTL eﬀective ﬁeld theory has been used for a large variety of computations of

both static and dynamical properties of thermal plasmas (see for example Ref.[8]), while the

static properties in the high T limit of QED and QCD have been typically studied with the

use of dimensional reduced eﬀective ﬁeld theories [9–11]. One of the aims of this paper is to

show that eﬀective ﬁeld theory techniques can also be used to compute power corrections to

the HTLs, as arising from the hard scales in the plasma.

The concept of eﬀective ﬁeld theory (EFT) is widely and successfully used in Physics.

It relies on the idea that in order to discuss relevant phenomena at a given energy scale,

it is enough to identify the degrees of freedom that operate at that scale, and uncover

the Lagrangian that governs their dynamics. The Lagrangian is organized in operators of

increasing dimension over powers of the high energy scales, so that all the information on

the high energy scales (beyond the explicit powers) is encoded in the matching coeﬃcients

of these operators. The matching coeﬃcients are obtained by enforcing the EFT to be

equivalent to the fundamental theory at a given order in the ratio of scales and/or in some

small parameter, typically a coupling constant. Nowadays, a large number of EFTs have

been derived at zero temperature, from which we will only quote the ones that have been

relevant for the present work. High Density Eﬀective Theory (HDET) describes the quantum

ﬂuctuations around the Fermi level of a ﬁnite density system, being the chemical potential

the high energy scale [12]. In Non-Relativistic QED/QCD (NRQED/NRQCD) [13] the high

energy scale is the mass of the heavy particles and the low energy scales the remaining ones

3

in a non-relativistic bound state. Heavy Quark Eﬀective Theory (HQET) [14–16] may be

considered the simplest particular case of NRQCD, in which the only low energy scale is

ΛQCD, the typical hadronic scale. The construction of HQET is formally very similar to the

one of HDET, and it was a source of inspiration for the so called Large Energy Eﬀective

Theory (LEET) [17]. Soft-Collinear Eﬀective theory (SCET) [18, 19] may be regarded as a

completion of the latter, in which the high energy scale is a dynamical variable and hence

the matching coeﬃcients are dynamical functions rather than functions of ﬁxed parameters.

This feature will be shared by the EFT used in this work. It ﬁrst appeared in Potential

NRQCD/NRQED (pNRQED/pNRQCD) [20], in which the quantum mechanical potentials

are regarded as position-dependent matching coeﬃcients. In recent years, some of the EFTs

above have been combined with the thermal EFTs in order to study the thermal properties

of non-relativistic bound states [21–26] and jets [27].

In this manuscript we will show that the recently proposed on-shell eﬀective ﬁeld theory

(OSEFT), see Ref. [28], is a systematic and powerful tool to extract power corrections to

the HTLs. As an example we focus here in studying the retarded polarization tensor of

QED. The OSEFT was used in Ref. [28] to provide a derivation of the recently proposed

chiral kinetic theory at ﬁnite temperature [29–32]. However, its possible applications have

a much wider scope. The OSEFT is meant to describe physical phenomena dominated by

almost on-shell particles. Here, for simplicity, we will restrict ourselves to the case of QED

with massless fermions. The formalism can be generalized to deal with on-shell massive

particles or with non-Abelian interactions. Starting from the QED Lagrangian we derive

the Lagrangian describing the (small) quantum ﬂuctuations around the on-shell degrees of

freedom, which can be expanded as a series in 1/p, where p is the energy associated to the
on-shell degrees of freedom in a given frame. In a thermal plasma, for p ∼ T in the rest
frame of the plasma, our formalism not only allows us to easily extract the HTLs, but also

corrections to them expanded in powers of 1/T . In this paper we develop the techniques to

perform these computations, and extract the ﬁrst corrections to the HTL associated with

the retarded photon polarization tensor. We also check explicitly that the results obtained

from the OSEFT agree with those obtained with full QED, at the order of accuracy we

work, up to local counterterms, as it should be the case in an EFT.

This paper is structured as follows. In Sec. II we present the rationale behind the OSEFT,

and how to derive the eﬀective Lagrangian associated with the quantum ﬂuctuations around

4

on-shell particles and antiparticles. In Sec. II A we give the explicit form of the eﬀective La-

grangians up to order 1/p3 in the energy expansion, after performing local ﬁeld redeﬁnitions,

which facilitate the computations carried out in this manuscript. In Sec. II B we present

the propagators for the particle and antiparticle quantum ﬂuctuations in a thermal bath,

in the so called real time formalism. Sec. III is devoted to the computation of the retarded

photon polarzation tensor with the OSEFT. After introducing the two relevant topologies -

bubble and tadpole diagrams- and making some generic comments on how to organize the

calculation, we show results at order e2T 2, e2T , and e2T 0, in Secs. III A, III B and III C,

respectively. In Sec. III A we obtain the standard HTL result and in Sec. III B we show that

there is no contribution at order e2T . In Sec. III C we present the contribution of the bubble

and tadpole diagrams separately, and pin point the inherent ambiguities of the latter at this

order. We close with a discussion in Sec. IV. Appendices A and C contain technical details.

Appendix B shows how the calculations can be carried out in the imaginary time formalism,

and in Appendix D we carry out the calculation directly from QED in order to check the

reliability of the OSEFT.

We use natural units  = c = kB = 1, metric conventions gµν = (1,−1,−1,−1), and

boldface letters to denote 3-dimensional vectors.

II. THE ON-SHELL EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORY

In this section we review how to construct the basic eﬀective action of the OSEFT ﬁrst

introduced in Ref. [28]. For the computation of diﬀerent physical observables dominated by

the contribution of almost on-shell fermions it is convenient to construct an EFT where the

role of the quantum ﬂuctuations is clearly singled out. Let us recall that the propagation

of an on-shell massless fermion is described by its energy E = p, with p > 0, and the four

light-like velocity vµ = (1, v), where v is three-dimensional unit vector. However, for a

fermion close to be on-shell, its four momentum can be expressed as

qµ = pvµ + kµ ,

(1)

where kµ is the residual momentum (kµ (cid:28) p), i.e. the part of the momentum which makes
qµ slightly oﬀ-shell.

A similar decomposition of the momentum for almost on-shell antifermions can be done

as follows

where ˜vµ = (1,−v) .

qµ = −p˜vµ + kµ

5

(2)

We will apply these splittings when writing the Lagrangian of almost on-shell fermions,

as then

L =

(cid:88)

Lp,v ,

Lp,v = ¯ψvγ · iDψv ,

iDµ = i∂µ + eAµ .

(3)

The electromagnetic ﬁeld above is assumed to contain soft momenta only (lµ (cid:28) p). The

p,v

precise meaning of the summatory shown in Eq. (3) will be given later on.

The Dirac ﬁeld in Eq. (3) can be written factoring out its p-dependence

is minus the transverse projector to v, written in covariant form. Note that D0⊥ = 0 and, in
our conventions, k2⊥ = P µν⊥ kµkν = −k2⊥.

In the OSEFT the particle and antiparticle degrees of freedom, described by the χ and ξ

ﬁelds, respectively, are totally decoupled. That is why the EFT techniques here employed can

6

be seen as the quantum ﬁeld theory counterpart of the Foldy-Wouthuysen diagonalization

methods employed at the level of the ﬁrst quantized Dirac Hamiltonian [33].

Note also that the antiparticle part of the Lagrangian keeps the same structure as the
particle part, as the two are equivalent if one performs the changes p ↔ −p and vµ ↔ ˜vµ
(or v ↔ −v) . This is a reﬂection of the CP symmetry of the underlying theory.

A. Eﬀective Lagrangian up to third power in the energy expansion

The eﬀective theory just presented allows us to assess the eﬀect of the quantum ﬂuctua-

tions to diﬀerent processes dominated by almost on-shell fermions in an expansion in powers

of 1/p. In order to do so one simply has to expand in 1/p the Lagrangian Eq. (7). The ﬁrst

two terms in this expansion were explicitly considered in Ref. [28]. They read

where σµν⊥ = P µ⊥αP ν⊥βσαβ, and σµν = i
2[γµ, γν]. We will focus on the Lagrangian for the
particle ﬂuctuations, the Lagrangian for the antiparticle ﬂuctuations is easily obtained after
performing the changes p ↔ −p and vµ ↔ ˜vµ.

The interaction terms generated at order 1/p2, and higher, contain temporal derivatives.

In order to simplify the computations of diﬀerent Feynman diagrams at this and higher orders

it is convenient to perform local ﬁeld redeﬁnitions, such that only temporal derivatives acting
on the fermionic ﬁelds appear in the leading order Lagrangian, that is, in L(0)
standard procedure in non-relativistic eﬀective theories [34]. Thus, if at order 1/p2 we make

to the Lagrangian obtained for massive fermions in a non relativistic 1/m expansion [34],

with now the energy p playing a similar role as the mass m. In the OSEFT there is however

an additional term proportional to iv · D − ˜v · D, which is absent in NRQED in the second
order correction in the mass expansion.

At order 1/p3 a new local ﬁeld redeﬁnition eliminates the temporal derivatives at that

at higher orders in the energy expansion.

B. Propagators of the OSEFT in a thermal bath

In this manuscript we will carry out computations of thermal contributions to the po-

larization tensor in the real time formalism (RTF), as then it is natural to split the four

momentum into an on-shell and oﬀ-shell part.

In the imaginary time formalism (ITF),

where the energies are written in terms of quantized Matsubara frequencies, such an split-

ting cannot be naturally performed. In order to present in full coherence the derivation of

the fermion propagators and Feynman diagrams in the theory, we will work in the Keldysh

formulation of the RTF, see Ref.[35]. However, a posteriori it is easy to realize how similar

computations can as well be performed using the ITF. We defer a discussion on how those

computations should be carried out to Appendix B.

In the Keldysh representation of the RTF the propagators are formulated as 2×2 matrices,
in the space spanned by particle/thermal ghosts. The fermion propagator associated with
the lowest order Lagrangian L(0)

p,v reads

 1

(15)

 ,

S(k) = Pvγ0

where nf (x) = 1/(exp(|x|/T ) + 1) is the Fermi-Dirac thermal distribution function.

Eq. (15) can be deduced in two diﬀerent ways. One possibility is to start with the

Dirac fermion propagator with dependence on the full momentum qµ, perform the splitting

of Eq. (1), keeping only the leading terms in a large p expansion. Alternatively, one can

deduce it from the OSEFT Lagrangian, but realizing that p acts as a sort of chemical

potential for the quantum ﬂuctuations. This last observation becomes apparent when we

write the Hamiltonian of the full theory in terms of χv, ξ˜v, and their canonical momenta.

p,v = πv ∂0χv + ˜π˜v ∂0ξ˜v − L(0)
p,v ,

(16)

(17)

(18)

is the Hamiltonian of the OSEFT.

At every order in the 1/p expansion the propagator is modiﬁed, a property that must

be taken into account when performing loop computations at a given order in the energy

expansion. In the remaining part of this manuscript we will use rather the retarded, advanced

and symmetric particle propagators, which can be constructed in the Keldysh formalism in

the standard way [35]

SR/A = S11 − S12/21 ,

SS = S11 + S22 .

(19)

The propagators in the Keldysh formalism as derived from considering the OSEFT La-

grangian up to order n in the energy expansion read

SR/A(k) =

Pvγ0

k0 ± i − f (k)

,

SS(k) = Pvγ0 (−2πiδ(k0 − f (k)) (1 − 2nf (p + k0))) .

The expansion of f(k) at order n will be denoted as f (n)(k). At lowest order

and we have deﬁned k(cid:107) = k · v, while

f (0)(k) = k(cid:107) ,

f (1)(k) = k(cid:107) +

as follows from Eqs. (10) and (12), respectively.

The propagators for the antiparticle quantum ﬂuctuations can be also be easily deduced.

They read

(cid:101)SR/A(k) =
(cid:101)SS(k) = −P˜vγ0

(25)
where the function ˜f (k) can be obtained from f (k), with the replacements v → −v and
p → −p. Note the extra minus sign in the symmetric antiparticle propagator, absent in its
particle counterpart. The presence of this additional minus sign might be deduced from the

,

full theory.

We note that in performing computations of Feynman diagrams at a given order in the
1/p expansion the above propagators should be Taylor expanded, assuming that k0, k (cid:28) p.
We will denote the pieces of this expansion as S(n), where n labels the order of the expansion.

Also note that due to the local ﬁeld redeﬁnitions introduced beyond leading order the

propagators deduced from the OSEFT and those derived from the full theory also diﬀer

beyond leading order. However, the dispersion relations coincide, as they should.

III. COMPUTATION OF THE RETARDED PHOTON POLARIZATION

TENSOR FOR SOFT MOMENTUM

In this section we compute in the framework of the OSEFT the one-loop retarded photon

polarization tensor up to third order in the energy expansion, assuming that the photon

momentum l is soft, or of order eT . In a thermal plasma it is well-known that the leading

order behavior is given by the HTL polarization tensor [3, 4] (see also Ref. [36] for an

alternative derivation using the RTF). As it is known that the HTLs are dominated by the
contribution of almost on-shell particles and antiparticles with energies ∼ T , we will then
assume p ∼ T . We will also assume that lµ (cid:28) p, but lµ ∼ kµ. We will eﬀectively show that
the OSEFT allows to reproduce, to leading order, the HTL polarization tensor, but also

allows us to extract in a very systematic way subleading corrections to the HTLs.

There are two topologically diﬀerent kind of diagrams that contribute at one-loop to

the photon polarization tensor in the OSEFT, that we call bubble and tadpole diagrams,

respectively. The generic form of the particle’s contribution to the retarded polarization

10

OSEFT. The blob symbolizes any vertex that may contribute to a given order.

tensor for the bubble diagrams reads (see Fig. III left)

Tr[V µ SS(k − l) V ν SR(k)] + Tr[V µ SA(k − l) V ν SS(k)]

,

(27)

where we have dropped all the subindices that label the order of the energy expansion in

the vertices V µ, W µν, and in the propagators. The k and l dependence of V µ and W µν

must be understood. We have a single sum on p and v above because the interaction with

soft photons cannot change p and v. Further, we have taken into account that no vertex
connects particle and thermal ghost propagators (i .e., V µ

12/21 = W µν

12/21 = 0).

The appearance of the tadpole diagrams in the eﬀective ﬁeld theory, which are absent

in the full theory, take into account particle-photon interactions mediated by an oﬀ-shell

antiparticle (or viceversa for the antiparticle-photon interactions). We will see that they are

necessary in order to fulﬁl the Ward identity lµΠµν = 0 of the fundamental theory at every

order in the energy expansion.

Some generic simpliﬁcations occur in the computation of both the bubble and tadpole

Feynman diagrams. First, one notices that the last line of Eq. (26) vanishes, as one can

immediately check after performing the k0 integral. This is due to the fact that the poles

of the two retarded (or advanced) propagators lie on the same side of the complex plane.

Similarly, one can check that terms proportional to the retarded and the advanced fermion

propagator vanish in Eq. (27).

llkk-lkll11

The non-vanishing terms of the bubble contribution to the retarded polarization tensor

can be computed in a rather systematic and compact way thanks to the local ﬁeld redeﬁni-

tions introduced in Sec. II A. Feynman rules associated with the photon-fermion interactions

can be extracted at every order in the 1/p expansion from the Lagrangians written down

in Subsec. II A. The corresponding vertex appearing in the bubble diagram at order n is
denoted by V µ

(n), and for completeness we present in Table I explicit values of those vertices
for n = 0, 1, 2. The evaluation of the bubble diagrams then requires the computation of

diﬀerent traces, that in order to simplify the notation we denote as

(cid:99)Tr[V µ

(m)] ≡ Tr[Pvγ0V µ

(n) V ν

(n) Pvγ0V ν

(m)]

(28)

(cid:21)

for the particle ﬂuctuations. Further, the k0 integral that appears in all the bubble diagrams

can be easily performed, given the form of propagators in the Keldysh representation, see

Eq. (20), and also due to the fact that there is no frequency dependence in the vertices of

the theory. The energy integral present in all the bubble diagrams is of the form

(cid:20)

(29)

Thus, if one wants to compute the bubble diagram at a given order in 1/p one simply has

to expand for large p an integral like the one above, in addition to considering the possible

p dependence of the vertices of the diagram. In appendix A we present the result of these

expansions as soon as the fermion dispersion law is ﬁxed at order 1/p2, that is, we present
the explicit values of I (1)
= 0, due to the fact that Eq. (29)
k0
depends on a diﬀerence of the fermion distribution functions, and lµ, kµ (cid:28) p. If we consider
the contribution to a bubble diagram with propagators at order n, the bubble diagram is

TABLE II: Traces needed for the computation of the tadpole-like diagrams for the particle sector.

The vertices W µν

(n) involve two photon lines and are computed from Eqs. (10), (12) and (14), for

the cases n = 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The momentum carried out by the incomming photon

is lµ, while kµ is the momentum of the incoming fermion. The < subscript means that only

the contributions corresponding to the incoming momentum carried out by the left photon are

displayed. The contributions corresponding to the incoming momentum carried out by the right

photon, which will be labeled by the > subscript, may be obtained by changing the sign of l, as

diplayed in the second last line. The full expression reads W µν

(n)(k, l) and is displayed in the last line.

Note that for n = 1 there is no dependence on l or k and hence we drop them from the expressions.
The corresponding expressions for the antiparticle sector may be obtained by changing v → ˜v and
p → −p.

A. Polarization tensor at order e2T 2

We start by computing the retarded polarization tensor at the ﬁrst non-trivial order in the

energy expansion. The bubble diagram can be immediately evaluated, and after performing

the k0 integral as prescribed in Eq. (29), it reads

Those pieces turn out to be important when we compute higher order corrections to the

be found out after performing the angular integrals of Eq. (40). More explicitly

B. Polarization tensor at order e2T

At this order in the expansion we ﬁnd a vanishing contribution to the polarization tensor

in the rotational invariant thermal plasma. Let us explain how this happens ﬁrst for the

particle’s contribution, the antiparticle contribution is similarly computed.

Let us consider ﬁrst the tadpole diagrams, which read

The explicit expressions of the tadpole contributions at this order can be written down after

using the values of the traces displayed in Table II. After expressing these contributions in

terms of the original variables it is not diﬃcult to realize that they cancel after performing
the angular integration over ˆq (note that to leading order v ∼ ˆq).

where we have integrated by parts the fermionic distribution function. What it is most

surprising, not obvious at ﬁrst sight, is that Eq. (49) vanishes, after performing the angular

integration.

As the antiparticle contribution at this order also vanishes, we then conclude that there

is no ﬁnite contribution to the polarization tensor at order e2T .

C. Polarization tensor at order e2T 0

We distribute this section in two subsections. In the ﬁrst one we display the (unambigu-

ous) contribution of the bubble diagram, and in the second one we illustrate the inherent

ambiguity of the tadpole contributions at this order by calculating them in two apparently

equivalent ways. We shall focus on the contribution of particles, since the contribution of

antiparticles may be easily obtained from it, as it has been done in previous sections.

terms of I (3)
k0

are canceled if we re-express the contribution computed at lower orders in the

1/p expansion in terms of the full momentum q. A proof of how this happens for the tadpole

contribution is presented in Appendix C.

order not to overcharge the notation we have dropped the subindex q in all the variables of

the integrand above, that should be understood.

We note that the bubble contribution alone, as it happens at order 1/p, does not fulﬁl

the Ward identity of QED. From Eq. (51), it is easy to see that lµΠµν

b,(3)(l) contains only local

terms that lead to

This can also be checked by explicitly performing the angular integrals in Eq. (51). One

from which we easily obtain Eq.(52). The tadpole contribution at order 1/p3 is then required

to get the Ward identity fulﬁlled.

To the particle contribution one should add the antiparticle contribution to the bubble

diagram. One can show that at this order

(cid:101)Πµν

b,(3)(l) = Πµν

b,(3)(l) .

2. Tadpole diagrams

In this section, we show how two apparently equivalent ways to calculate the tadpole

diagrams lead to diﬀerent results.

a. Naive evaluation

If we proceed as in the previous sections, the contribution of the tadpole diagrams reads

(cid:90) d4k

(cid:88)

Πµν

t,(3)(l) =

i
2

p,v

S (k) + W µν

(2)(k, l) S(1)

S (k) + W µν

(1) S(2)

S (k)] . (58)

Only the ﬁrst term gives a dependence on l. Let us evaluate it in the following. By substi-

tuting the zero-th order symmetric propagator in Eq. (58) we obtain

Πµν

t,(3)(l) =

e2
2

(2π)3 Tr(Pvγ0W µν

(3)(k, l))(1 − 2nf (p)) .

(59)

(cid:90) d3k

(cid:88)

p,v

19

After expressing this integral in terms of the momentum q according to Eq. (39), it is not

diﬃcult to check that the pure thermal contribution is infrared (IR) divergent. In addition

the T = 0 contribution is both IR and UV divergent. However, the combination that appears
in Eq. (59) is IR ﬁnite, as it can be seen by expanding for small p the ratio (1− 2nf (p))/p3.
So the tadpole contribution at order 1/p3 is logarithmically divergent in the UV, but IR

ﬁnite. The UV divergent piece fulﬁlls the Ward identity, and hence it may be canceled by

adding a proper counterterm in the Lagrangian built out of the diﬀerent components of the

electromagnetic ﬁeld strength tensor. Furthermore, ﬁnite contributions are also found, that

added to Eq. (51) result into a polarization tensor which is respectful with the Ward identity.

Let us see how this eﬀectively works. We will use DR, with d = 3 + . We also neglect

pieces that cancel after angular integration, so that the diﬀerent tensorial components of

Eq.(59) are

Whereas there is nothing wrong in the fact that the UV counterterms of the eﬀective

theory diﬀer from the ones of the fundamental one, it is indeed somewhat surprising in our

case. At one loop, the calculation in the fundamental theory involves contributions from

21

FIG. 2: This ﬁgure illustrates how the tadpole diagrams are calculated in Sec. III C 2 b.

two particle (antiparticle) legs on-shell and from one particle (antiparticle) on-shell one

antiparticle (particle) oﬀ-shell, as it has been made explicit in the Appendix D. There is a

one-to-one mapping between these contributions and the bubble and tadpole diagrams of the

EFT respectively. Hence, at this order in α, the EFT appears to be exactly equivalent to the

fundamental theory and consequently one would expect the same UV behaviour. The results

diﬀer because the tadpole contribution is ambiguous even in dimensional regularization. The
ambiguity becomes explicit if one, for instance, puts k − l rather than k as the momentum
in the loop. In the following section we devise a procedure by which the UV behavior of the

fundamental theory is recovered while keeping the Ward identity fulﬁlled.

b. UV matched evaluation

The rationale behind this procedure is that tadpole diagrams may be obtained from

bubble diagrams in the fundamental theory by collapsing one of the legs. By doing so one
obtains one tadpole with momentum k in the loop and one tadpole with momentum k − l in
the loop, rather than only tadpoles with momentum k in the loop, as we had in the section
III C 2 a. One prescription that provides tadpoles with momentum k and k − l in the loop
is the following. When the incoming photon is to the left of the outgoing photon, we put
k as the momentum in the loop, and when it is the other way around, we put k − l as the
momentum in the loop, see Fig. 2. Then formula (58) is replaced by

where we have explicitly displayed the real and imaginary parts of the polarization tensors,

the last corresponding to corrections to HTL Landau damping. Let us comment here that

our results of the longitudinal polarization tensor agree with the one-loop computation of

Π00(0, l) in Ref. [38] (see Eq. (3.26)), see also Ref. [39]. To the best of our knowledge, the

complete expression of the polarization tensor at this order in the T expansion has not been

computed before.

IV. DISCUSSION

We have shown how the EFT techniques that have been developed to study diﬀerent

systems, ranging from the high density regime to the non-relativistic limits of QED and

QCD, can also be applied to obtain power corrections to the HTL’s at high temperature.

We have used here the OSEFT to systematically organize the interactions of the hard scales

of the plasma in powers of momenta, a fact that allows us to recognize all the contributions

to the one-loop diagrams to a given order in a 1/T expansion. Furthermore, with the OSEFT

we can understand the form of the non-localities that appear in these amplitudes at any

order, as from the leading order Lagrangian Eq. (10) we see that these can only be 1/iv.∂ or
1/i˜v.∂ to a maximum power given by the order of the expansion (one at O(e2T 2) and three
at O(e2T 0), etc.).

Let us emphasize that the OSEFT might have many other applications than those here

presented.

In particular, since it properly describes the hard degrees of freedom of the

plasma, it might be readily applied to the study of transport phenomena. Note also that all

our basic discussion of the derivation of the EFT Lagrangian in Sec. II does not require the

presence of a thermal bath, and thus the OSEFT might have applications beyond thermal

ﬁeld theory.

We should pin point here the diﬀerences and similarities that the OSEFT has with respect

24

to other EFTs. In particular, the form of the OSEFT Lagrangian seems to be quite similar

to the Lagrangian of the HDET. The main diﬀerence relies on the fact that HDET is

only strictly valid at T = 0, when there is a well-deﬁned Fermi surface. The quantum

ﬂuctuations then are only those around the Fermi surface. The high energy scale in HDET

is the chemical potential µ, a ﬁxed variable, and antiparticle ﬂuctuations are not taken

into account. In the OSEFT the high energy scale is the dynamical on-shell energy of the

particles or antiparticles, and these two degrees of freedom are treated on equal footing.

While in Ref.[40] the HDET has been used to derive the so called hard dense loops, the

explicit meaning of the summatory given in the ﬁnal expressions seems to diﬀer from the

one associated in this paper. The OSEFT also shares many similarities with SCET, the

main diﬀerence being that the latter is built for a ﬁxed number of privileged directions

along which the particles are almost on shell (jet-like events), whereas in the OSEFT the

almost on-shell particles may be found in any direction.

In this manuscript we have presented the ﬁrst power correction in the high temperature

expansion to the HTL polarization tensor in QED. As we already saw the contributions to

the polarization tensor at order T vanish, and the ﬁrst non-vanishing correction does not

depend on T (up to logarithms that ﬁx the scale of the running coupling constant), even if it

is due to the thermal eﬀects in the plasma. The new correction represents modiﬁcations of

order α, the electromagnetic ﬁne structure constant, to the soft photon propagation. This

should be compared to the contributions to the photon polarization tensor arising at two-

loop order from the hard scales, which are of order e4T 2. Then for soft momenta, when
l ∼ eT , the new contribution computed in this manuscript and the two-loop order result
would be equally important.

Our results can be readily applied to the computation of the electromagnetic polarization

tensor in the quark-gluon plasma, by just taking into the electromagnetic charges of the
diﬀerent quark ﬂavors. Again, at the QCD soft scale l ∼ gT , where g is the QCD gauge
coupling constant, assummed to be small, the new contributions computed here would be

of the same order as the two-loop hard contribution, and hence a leading correction to the

HTL result.

It might be worth to compute the power corrections to the gluon polarization tensor

in QCD. The quark contribution to the gluon polarization tensor could be rescued from

our QED result, simply by taking into account some color and ﬂavor factors. The gluon

25

contribution could be computed using similar ideas to those here presented, although the

proper framework to treat the gluons within the EFT should be ﬁrst developed. In QCD

this would represent a next to leading order correction to the the HTL polarization tensor

(recall that in the case of QCD the soft contribution is Bose enhanced with respect to the

hard one).

Appendix B: OSEFT computations using the Imaginary Time Formalism

The computations we carried out in this manuscript using the RTF can also be reproduced

using the ITF. In this Appendix we brieﬂy mention the main ingredients that are needed to

compute the OSEFT Feynman diagrams in the ITF.

In order to proceed with the ITF one has to perform a rotation to Euclidean space-

time of the theory. One can derive the Euclidean propagators at every order in the 1/p

expansion from our Euclidean rotated Lagrangians, where now the energies are given by the
fermionic Matsubara frequencies, ωj = (2j +1)πT , with j ∈ Z. It is also important to realize
that the energy p acts as a chemical potential for the fermionic quantum ﬂuctuations (or

minus chemical potential for antifermionic ﬂuctuations), see Eq. (16), so that the Matsubara

frequencies should be shifted accordingly in the propagators.

A major simpliﬁcation of the computations using the ITF is also achieved if one performs

27

the local ﬁeld redeﬁnitions of Sec. II A. Then the computation of the diﬀerent one-loop

diagrams at a given order in 1/p basically involves the evaluation of two sorts of sums of

Matsubara frequencies: those that appear in the bubble diagrams, and those that appear

in the tadpole diagrams. More particularly, for the bubble diagrams there is always a sum

over Matsubara frequencies of the form

(cid:88)

j

iωj − p − f (k)

iωj − iωs − p − f (k − l)

= −nf (p + f (k − l)) − nf (p + f (k))

−iωs − f (k − l) + f (k)

, (B1)

where iωs is the bosonic Matsubara frequency corresponding to the photon. Note that if we
rotate back to Minkowski space −iωs → l0 + i, we recover the result of the basic integral
Eq. (29) which appears in the bubble diagrams using the RTF.

For the tadpole diagrams the only sort of Matsubara frequency sum to be considered is

(cid:88)

j

T

which also allows us to recover the same results for the tadpole diagrams computed with

the RTF.

Appendix C: Cancellation of the k2 terms

Here we consider only the cancellation of the pieces of order k2 in the particle con-

tributions to the tadpoles at order 1/p3, the same reasoning applies to the antiparticle’s

contribution. As these pieces are the same no matter if one computes the tadpoles using

the naive prescription, or the UV matched evaluation, the proof applies to these two ways

of computing the tadpoles. We concentrate on the tensorial structures which are spatial.

Let us consider only the pieces which depend on k2 that appear in the computation at

order 1/p3 in the tadpole diagrams. These read

These tadpole contributions can be trivially expressed in terms of the original variable q, as
to leading order v ∼ ˆq, nf (p) ∼ nf (q), etc. We will see that all of them are cancelled by the
contributions arising from the lower order tadpoles in the 1/p expansion, when expressed in

terms of the original momentum variable.

Let us consider the particle contribution to the tadpole diagram at order 1/p, and re-

express it in terms of the original momentum, keeping pieces up to order 1/q3. More explic-

itly, after using Eqs. (36), (37) and (38), this tadpole diagram gives

The pieces of order 1/q give account of the particle contribution to the tadpole diagram

integral. We are then left with pieces of order 1/q3.

Even if the tadpole at order 1/p2, Eq. (46), gives a vanishing contribution at order e2T ,

it still leads - after being expressed in terms of the original variable q - to contributions at

order 1/q3, which have also to be considered. More particularly, Eq. (46) expressed in terms

which correspond to the ﬁrst and second term of Eq. (46), respectively. As mentioned in

Sec. III B , the pieces of order 1/q2 above cancel after performing the angular integral.

It is now easy to see that the sum of all the tadpole contributions at order 1/q3, Eqs. (C1)

to (C6), leads to a cancellation of the k2 dependence at this order.

Similar computations should be carried out to see that the k2 pieces in the bubble dia-

grams which appear at order 1/p3 cancel when re-expressing the bubble contribution com-

puted at lower orders in the 1/p expansion in terms of q.

Appendix D: The retarded polarization tensor in QED

In this Appendix we present the computation of the retarded polarization tensor in QED
for soft external momentum ∼ eT , and at the same order of accuracy that was computed in
this paper. We also use the RTF, and analyze and compare the result with that obtained

with the OSEFT. Let us recall that to leading order in a T expansion one obtains the HTL,

and that follows upon expanding the value of integrand of the polarization tensor for large

values of the loop momentum, which is assumed to be of order T . Subleading terms in the

T expansion of the polarization tensor can as well be obtained if one keeps subleading terms

in the expansion of the integrand. This is the computation we have carried out to verify the

validity of our OSEFT results, and that we brieﬂy summarize here.

In QED the retarded photon polarization tensor in the RTF reads [36]

The trace is easily evaluated

(D3)

The q0-integration performed on the second line of Eq. (D1) reduces to zero, as one can

always close the countour in a half plane that does not contain a pole. We then consider

the ﬁrst term of Eq.(D1)

Tr[γµSS(q(cid:48))γνSR(q)] = −8πi (1 − 2nf (q(cid:48)

comparison with the OSEFT. We then arrive at

(cid:33)

Observe that each component of J µν depends on q0 and is therefore modiﬁed by the

delta function of the symmetric propagator in a diﬀerent way, according to whether one

considers the contribution of an on-shell particle or antiparticle. A similar calculation has

to be performed for the second term of Eq. (D1), which gives the contribution of on-shell
particles and antiparticles carrying momentum q rather than q − l as above. The fact that

31

both q and q− l on-shell momenta appear in the QED calculation suggests the prescription
used in Sec. III C 2 b to compute the tadpole diagrams in the OSEFT. Then one expands the
resulting expressions for large |q|. At leading order (O(e2T 2)), one obtains the HTL result.
At O(e2T 1) the expressions can still be handled analytically, and lead to the same result as
provided by the OSEFT in Eq. (49), which cancels after performing the angular integral.
At O(e2T 0), there are a large number of terms in the expansion, and we have carried out
such a computation with the aid of a computer algebra system (Mathematica).

While at the lowest orders in the computation the structure of the bubble and tadpole

diagrams that we encounter in the OSEFT is clearly seen, at order e2T 0 the comparison

with the OSEFT computation is not so straightforward. In order to reproduce the OSEFT

structure of terms (that is, the same sort of integrals that appear in both the bubble and

tadpole diagrams) within QED, angular integrations have to be carried out, and also one

has to integrate by parts the Fermi distribution function. This applies to all orders in the T

expansion, but at this order things are more subtle. This is in part due to the local ﬁeld redef-

initions we performed at order 1/p2 in the OSEFT to simplify the computations, which are

clearly manifested at this order, and also to the appearance of logarithmic UV divergences.

For instance, if we call “tadpole” in QED those pieces whose integrand is proportional to
(1 − 2nf (q)), we see that there are also contributions arising from particle-particle and
antiparticle-antiparticle interactions, and not only from mixed particle-antiparticle terms as

it happens in the OSEFT. Let us call “bubble” to the remaining contributions, which upon

partial integrations become proportional to dnf (q)/dq, we then have

The spatial components of the “tadpole” contribution read

As in the OSEFT this expression is UV divergent, and it is regularized using DR, providing

the photon wave function renormalization, as well as other ﬁnite contributions. The UV

divergent terms agree with the ones obtained in Sec. III C 2 b but disagree with the ones

of Sec. III C 2 a, as remarked before. After regularization part of the ﬁnite contributions

can then also be expressed as a contribution proportional to the derivative of the Fermi

32

distribution function, and hence of the form of the local pieces that may arise in the bubble

contribution. The spatial components of the “bubble” contribution in QED read

where the particle and antiparticle contributions are displayed. The latter, after performing
the change of variables v → −v in the integral, can be expressed in the same way as the
particle contribution. The non-local pieces of the above expression agree with twice the

non-local pieces of Eq. (51), whereas the local pieces above add up to zero upon angular

integration.

For Π00(l) and Π0i(l) we obtain exactly the same expressions as in Sec. III C both for

bubble and tadpole contribution, and also for UV divergent and ﬁnite pieces.

In summary, we have checked that the OSEFT reproduces the polarization tensor of

QED, up to a local piece at order e2T 0. This requires the addition of the electric and

magnetic terms of the Maxwell Lagrangian multiplied by suitable matching coeﬃcients, as

discussed in Secs. III C 2 a and III C 2 b. The ﬁnal result for the longitudinal and transverse

components of the polarization tensor is displayed in Eqs. (78)-(79).
