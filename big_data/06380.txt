Abstract

A hypothetic Hidden Sector of the Universe, consisting of sterile fermions ("sterinos")

and sterile mediating bosons ("sterons") of mass dimension 1 (not 2!) — the last de-

scribed by an antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld — requires to exist also a scalar isovector and

scalar isoscalar in order to be able to construct electroweak invariant coupling (before

spontaneously breaking its symmetry). The introduced scalar isoscalar might be a reso-

nant source for the diphoton excess of 750 GeV, suggested recently by experiment.

1. Introduction

In the previous decade, we have introduced a speciﬁc Hidden Sector of the Universe,

consisting of sterile fermions (with mass dimension 3/2) and sterile mediating bosons (of

mass dimension 1) described by an antisymmetric-tensor ﬁeld Cµν (denoted, before, by

Aµν) [1,2]. In addition to the familiar structure of the Standard Model we have postulated

the existence of an extra scalar isovector (ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3) (i = 1, 2, 3) or

ϕ+ =

ϕ1 + iϕ2√2

. ϕ− =

ϕ1 − iϕ2√2

. ϕ0 = ϕ3

(1)

and also a scalar isoscalar ϕ0. While the former triplet is conserving, the latter singlet is
presumed to break spontaneously the electroweak symmetry, < ϕ0 >vac6= 0, acting beside
the popular Higgs scalar, < h0 >vac6= 0. The introduced sterile fermions ψ and sterile
mediating bosons Cµν we will call, for convenience, "sterinos" and "sterons", respectively.
If the tensor ﬁeld Cµν is gauged, Cµν = ∂µχν − ∂νχµ, by a vector ﬁeld χµ of mass
dimension 0, while ﬁeld χµ turns out to be absent outside Cµν, then the Lagrangian

density is gauge invariant, trivially.

In this case, the mass-dimension-0 vector χµ(x)

might play still a fundamental role in the creation of gravitational curvature gµν(x) as a

speciﬁc condensate of matter:

gµν(x) =< χµ(x)χν(x) >con

(2)

with the Coulomb-like gauge ∂νχν = 0 and ∂νCµν = (cid:3)χµ, where Cµν = ∂µχν − ∂νχµ .
Here, Cµν may be represented later by the matrix (8), and a special structure of Cµν can
be investigated. If e.g., C (E)
(i = 1, 2, 3), then (1/4)M 2CµνC µν = 0 (see later on

i = C (B)

i

Eq. (9)) and so, tensor Cµν is eﬀectively massless.

2. Coupling of Hidden Sector

The new scalars ϕ+ , ϕ− , ϕ0 and ϕ0 with < ϕ0 >vac6= 0 enable us to deﬁne electroweak-
symmetry invariant coupling of Hidden Sector to the Standard-Model world in the fol-

lowing form

Here, f and ξ or η are masslesss unknown coupling constants. The form (3) is a subject of
spontaneously electroweak symmetry breaking by < ϕ0 >vac6= 0, in addition to the Higgs
mechanism < h0 >vac6= 0 giving Weinberg-Salam mixing

Zµ = cos θW W 0
Aµ = − sin θW W 0

µ + sin θW Bµ ;

µ + cos θW Bµ ,

(4)

where Zµν = ∂µZν − ∂νZµ and Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ. Then, if we put tentatively ξ = η,
the form (3) implies (after breaking) the following neutral part of the electroweak-hidden

coupling:

ϕ(Z) = cos θW ϕ0 + sin θW ϕ0 ,
ϕ(F ) = − sin θW ϕ0 + cos θW ϕ0 .

(6)

Recall that in contrast to Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ, the antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld does not
get gauging Cµν = ∂µχν − ∂νχµ with mass dimension 2, when χµ has mass dimension 0.

Naturally, the kinetic Lagrangian density is now

A convenient way to represent the antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld Cµν reads as the electro-

magnetic-type matrix [2]:

3. Fermionic versus bosonic coupling

In particle physics a fundamental role is played by 16 independent Dirac matrices

building up 5 Lorentz covariant forms:

1

where {γµ, γν} = 2gµν , (µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3) and [σk , σl] = 2iεklmσm , (k, l, m = 1, 2, 3).

These covariant forms determine couplings of mediating bosons (with mass dimension

1) to fermionic pairs (with mass dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3). The mass dimension of

interaction Lagrangian density is then 1 + 3 = 4, while kinetic Lagrangian density of

mediating bosons gets the dimension 2 + 2 = 4.

teraction Lagrangian density.

Here, Aµ and Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ have mass dimension 1 and 2, respectively, while
−(1/4)FµνF µν = (1/2)Pk (E2

k − B2

density of photons.

All other fermionic couplings among those given by Eqs. (11) are also realized exper-

imentally, except for the Pauli-type antisymmetric tensor coupling

where a new antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld is introduced (see Eq. (8)) :

for µ = k , ν = 0

(k, l, m = 1, 2, 3). The mathematical existence of this tensor (isoscalar) suggests an ex-

perimentally new scalar isovector and scalar isoscalar.

Arguing for extending fermionic tensor coupling (13) to bosonic tensor coupling, we

obtain Eq. (3) as an electroweak-symmetry invariant coupling of Hidden Sector to the

Standard-Model world (before spontaneously breaking the symmetry).

An actual candidate for diphoton at 750 GeV, discussed recently [3,4], might be a

scalar isoscalar participating in the process (see [3,5]):

ϕ(F )
phys → γC → γ < ϕ(F ) >vac γ → γγ ,

(15)

where ϕ(F ) =< ϕ(F ) >vac +ϕ(F )
with ϕ(Z)

phys 6= 0 , we get the process:

phys with ϕ(F )

phys 6= 0. Similarly, for ϕ(Z) =< ϕ(Z) >vac +ϕ(F )

phys

ϕ(Z)
phys → ZC → Z < ϕ(F ) >vac γ → Zγ .

(16)

In Ref. [2] we considered alternatively

Free steron versus sterino

With the interaction and kinetic parts of steron Lagrangian density, Eqs. (3) and (7),

the Lagrangian ﬁeld equation for C µν reads:

((cid:3) − M 2)C µν ≡ −pf (cid:0) ¯ψσµνψ + ξϕiW µν

i + ηϕ0Bµν(cid:1) ,

(A1)

In the limit of f → 0, we obtain a free equation for C µν, ((cid:3) − M 2)C µν = 0, getting

the plane-wave solutions:

Now, we may impose a priori a hypothetic relation between polar and axial polariza-

besides the identity:

(A6)

(A7)

(in the right- or left-handed frame of reference, respectively). Then, the constraint (A 6)

(A8)

(A9)

(a = 1, 2, 3). Thus, from Eqs. (A 4) and (A 9) the trace of matrix eµν

a = 2(cid:0)~e (B)2

a − ~e (E)2

a

(cid:1) = 0 ,

(A10)

the last step being valid, when one uses the constraint (A 9). Then, we can infer that the

eﬀective mass term (1/4)M 2CµνC µν of the steron ﬁeld C µν vanishes (see Eq. (7)).

In a similar way, we get the sterino Lagrange ﬁeld equation:

(cid:18)γµi∂µ −

1

2pf σµνCµν − mψ(cid:19) ψ = 0,

(A11)

when we apply the energy and kinetic parts of sterino Lagrangian density, Eq. (3) and

the term

respectively. Due to the identity

¯ψ (γµi∂µ − mψ) ψ ,

2

σµνCµν = i ~α · ~C (E) + ~σ · ~C (B)

(A12)

(A13)

following from the formulae (8) and (11), we can rewrite the sterino ﬁeld equation (A 11)

as

6

hγµi∂µ − mψ −pf (cid:16)i~α · ~C (E) + ~σ · ~C (B)(cid:17)i = 0 ,

(A14)

where ~C (E,B) = (cid:16)C (E,B)
A physically interesting case might be a sterino ψ(x) embedded in the uniform steron
ﬁeld ~C (E) = −−−→const = (0, 0, C) and ~C (B) = −−−→const = (0, 0, C ′). Then, from Eq. (A 14) we
infer that

hE − ~α · ~p − βmψ −pf γ3 (iC + γ5C ′)i ψ = 0 ,

(A 15)

for i∂µψ(~p) = pµψ(~p) with ~p denoting the momentum of sterino, while E(~p) is its energy

spectrum, Multiplying Eq. (A 15) on the lhs by (cid:2)E + α · ~p + βmψ + √f γ3(iC + γ5C ′)(cid:3),

we get sterino quadratic spectrum:

hE2 − ~p 2 − m2

ψ − f (C 2 + C ′2) − 2pf C ′(σ3mψ + iγ1p2 − iγ2p1)i ψ = 0 .

(A 16)

We solve this spectrum in terms of sterino momenta p1, p2, p3, ﬁnding the eigenvalues

of the complete set of independent observables:

σ3ψ = msψ ≡ ±

Here, ~γ = β γ5 ~σ = β~α , (i~γ)† = i~γ and (iγ1)2 = 1 = (iγ2)2 as well as {iγ1, iγ2} = 0.
Thus,

so, squares of iγ1 and iγ2 are independent of σ3.

[σ3 ,{iγk , iγl}] = 2δkl[σ3 , 1] = 0
