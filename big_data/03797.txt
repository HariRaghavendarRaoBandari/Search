Lectures on Dark Matter Physics

Mariangela Lisanti

Department of Physics, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544

Abstract

Rotation curve measurements from the 1970s provided the ﬁrst strong indication that a signif-
icant fraction of matter in the Universe is non-baryonic. In the intervening years, a tremendous
amount of progress has been made on both the theoretical and experimental fronts in the search for
this missing matter, which we now know constitutes nearly 85% of the Universe’s matter density.
These series of lectures, ﬁrst given at the TASI 2015 summer school, provide an introduction to the
basics of dark matter physics. They are geared for the advanced undergraduate or graduate student
interested in pursuing research in high-energy physics. The primary goal is to build an understand-
ing of how observations constrain the assumptions that can be made about the astro- and particle
physics properties of dark matter. The lectures begin by delineating the basic assumptions that can
be inferred about dark matter from rotation curves. A detailed discussion of thermal dark matter
follows, motivating Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, as well as lighter-mass alternatives. As
an application of these concepts, the phenomenology of direct and indirect detection experiments
is discussed in detail.

Identifying the nature of dark matter (DM) remains one of the primary open questions in

physics. Measurements by Planck and WMAP demonstrate that nearly 85% of the Universe’s

matter density is dark [1]. The Standard Model of particle physics alone cannot explain the nature

of this DM, suggesting that the model must be extended. All evidence in favor of particle DM

thus far comes from observations of its gravitational eﬀects on baryonic matter. While we have

amassed important clues from these results, many open questions remain: What is the DM mass?

What is the strength of its interactions with visible matter? How is it distributed throughout the

Galaxy? Fortunately, we are in the midst of a data-driven era in astroparticle physics that holds

great promise towards addressing these questions. A wide variety of experiments are currently

reaching unprecedented sensitivity in their search for DM interactions in the lab and sky, and the

ﬁeld continues to evolve as new data forces re-evaluation of theory models.

These lectures provide an introduction to DM physics for advanced undergraduates and graduate

students. The primary goal is to help students build intuition for how to address the open questions

in the ﬁeld, while emphasizing the important interplay between theory and experiment. We will

begin by motivating a set of robust starting assumptions for the particle and astrophysical properties

of DM and then show how these assumptions aﬀect predictions for two classes of experiments: direct

and indirect detection. Exercises are interspersed throughout the text and provide an opportunity

for the interested reader to reﬂect more deeply on the material.

1 Astrophysical Distribution

We begin our discussion by focusing on the astrophysical properties of DM. This is a natural starting

point because the strongest evidence for DM comes from its gravitational interactions with visible

matter in the Milky Way. Therefore, we will start with rotation curves, which provided the ﬁrst

robust clue for DM, and see just how much we can infer about the non-baryonic component of the

Galaxy utilizing these observations. Amazingly, this one piece of evidence is suﬃcient to infer the

density and velocity distribution of DM in the Milky Way, and to posit the allowed mass range for

the new matter particles.

Because the DM is essentially invisible to us, we must rely on visible objects that can act

as tracers for it. An adequate tracer must be collisionless, so that its distribution is determined

primarily by its gravitational interactions, as should be the case for DM. What are our options?
Well, the Milky Way contains approximately ∼1011 stars with total mass ∼5 × 1010 M(cid:12) [2], where
M(cid:12) = 2.99 × 1030 kg is a unit of solar mass. The vast majority of these stars are located within
the Galactic disk, which has a radius of ∼10 kpc and height of ∼0.5 kpc. Our Sun, in particular,
is located far out along one of the spiral arms, about 8.5 kpc from the Galactic Center where there
is a black hole of mass ∼4 × 106 M(cid:12). The interstellar medium, composed primarily of atomic and
molecular Hydrogen, is concentrated along the Galactic disk, and makes up roughly 10% of the

1

total stellar mass.

Among these options, it turns out that stars serve as the best DM tracers and time-and-again

have provided important clues about its distribution. The reason for this is that stars in the disk
are essentially collisionless. The time between collisions is ∼1021 years—far longer than the age of
the Universe!

Exercise: Show that the stars in the Galactic disk are collisionless. You may assume that the stars
have a radius similar to that of the Sun (R(cid:12) = 2 × 10−8 pc) and a random velocity of ∼50 km/s.

1.1 Rotation Curves

One of the strongest pieces of evidence for DM comes from studying the rotational velocity of

stars. The fact that stars rarely collide means that their motion is dictated by their gravitational

interactions. From standard Newtonian gravity, we know that the stars’ circular velocity, vc, is

vc(r) =(cid:114) GM

r

,

where M is the enclosed mass, r is the radial distance, and G is the gravitational constant. For
distances that extend beyond the Galactic disk (r (cid:38) Rdisk), Gauss’ Law tells us that M should
remain constant assuming all the mass is concentrated in the disk, and vc ∝ r−1/2.
Instead,
observations ﬁnd that the circular velocity curve ﬂattens out at these distances, implying that
M (r) ∝ r. This suggests that there is an additional ‘dark’ component of matter beyond the visible
matter in the disk.1 The most convincing measurement of ﬂat rotation curves was ﬁrst published

in 1970 by Rubin and Ford [4], with optical measurements that extended to radial distances of

24 kpc for the M31 (Andromeda) galaxy. Figure 1 shows their results superimposed on 21-cm
measurements by Roberts and Whitehurst that extend to ∼30 kpc [5]. It is clear that the M31
rotation curve ﬂattens at distances greater than 10 kpc.

From rotation curves, we infer that the DM mass density distribution is

ρ(r) ∝

M (r)
r3 ∼

1
r2 .

Note the implicit assumption being made here: namely, that the DM is distributed in a spherically

symmetric halo about the center of the Galaxy, in contrast to the baryons which are concentrated

in the disk. Because baryons can interact strongly amongst themselves, they have a means of

1Another interpretation for the ﬂattening of the rotation curve is the possibility that Newton’s laws of gravity
are altered at large distances [3]. MOdiﬁed Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is a class of phenomenological models
that seek to address this point. While MOND is most successful at explaining galaxy-scale eﬀects, it has not been
absorbed into a fully cosmological picture to date.

dissipating energy and can thus collapse into a disk. DM, in contrast, is not dissipative2 and thus

forms spherical ‘halos.’

Let us get an order-of-magnitude estimate for the mass and size scale of the Milky Way’s DM
halo. Stellar kinematics constrain the total mass of the halo to be Mhalo ∼1012 M(cid:12) and the local
DM density to be ρ0 ∼ 0.3 GeV/cm3. For a review of the current status of these measurements and
a detailed discussion of the (large) uncertainties, see [7]. Therefore, the radius of the halo, Rhalo,
is approximately

almost certainly too simplistic. Also, it is not correct to think of a halo as having a ﬁnite end and

It assumes a spherically symmetric density distribution that is

establishing an adequate reference for comparing the sizes of diﬀerent halos is a subtle point that

we will not address here—see [8]. All that being said, the estimate above indicates that the DM

halo extends out roughly an order of magnitude beyond the baryonic disk!

The average velocity of the DM in the halo can be obtained using the virial theorem:

(cid:104)v(cid:105) ∼(cid:114) GMhalo

Rhalo ∼ 200 km/s .

2Theories with several DM components may include a small fraction of self-interacting particles that collapse to

form a disk [6].

in predicting observational signatures. We can further reﬁne our estimates of the expected DM

velocity by taking advantage of the fact that the DM density and velocity are related through

the gravitational potential. As a result, once the density distribution is set, there is an associated

velocity distribution that makes the theory self-consistent. In particular, an isotropic halo in steady

state with an inverse-square density distribution has a Maxwellian velocity distribution. Deriving

this explicitly requires knowledge of the Boltzmann equation and Jeans Theorem, so let us take a

moment to review these important concepts.

1.2 The Boltzmann Equation & Jeans Theorem

The Boltzmann equation describes the evolution of the phase-space density f (x, v) of a DM particle
in the halo. This gives the probability f (x, v) d3x d3v of ﬁnding the particle in some volume d3x d3v.

Conservation of probability dictates that

(cid:90) f (x, v) d3x d3v = 1 .

The Boltzmann equation states that

L[f ] = C[f ] ,

(1.1)

where L and C are the Liouville and collision operators, respectively. The most general form for

the Liouville operator is

L[f ] = pα ∂f

∂xα − Γα

βγ pβ pγ ∂f
∂pα ,

(1.2)

where Γα

βγ is the aﬃne connection. In the non-relativistic limit, (1.2) simpliﬁes to

Lnr[f ] =

∂f
∂t

+ ˙x

∂f
∂x

+ ˙v

∂f
∂v

.

The collision operator C[f ] includes interactions between DM and other particles (including itself)

that may alter the phase-space density. This operator can take a complicated form, depending on

the allowed interactions of the particles. To model the phase-space distribution of DM in the Milky

Way today, however, we can work with a simple form of the Boltzmann equation because the DM

in the halo is non-relativistic and collisionless, so

∂f
∂t

+ ˙x

∂f
∂x

+ ˙v

∂f
∂v

= 0 .

(1.3)

The collisionless Boltzmann equation has only a restricted set of solutions for f (x, v). Jeans

Theorem states that a steady-state solution to (1.3) can only be a function of the phase-space

4

coordinates through the integrals of motion I(x, v), which satisfy

d
dt

I(x(t), v(t)) = 0 .

For a detailed discussion of Jeans Theorem, see [2]. The Hamiltonian is one example of an integral

of motion. In this case, Jeans Theorem tells us that the phase-space distribution is solely a function
of energy E for a halo in steady state:

f (x, v) = f (E) where E = Ψ −

v2

1
2

and Ψ is the gravitational potential. Other integrals of motion include the angular momentum
variables L or Lz. Distribution functions such as f (E, L) or f (E, Lz) are all allowed solutions to
(1.3), leading to diﬀerent velocity distributions in each case.

Exercise: Show that the mean DM velocity (cid:104)v(cid:105) vanishes and that the velocity-dispersion tensor
(cid:104)vivj(cid:105) is isotropic if the phase-space distribution is only a function of energy.

For an isotropic halo in steady-state with velocity distribution f (E) ∝ eE , the associated density

distribution is

ρ ∝(cid:90) ∞

0

dv v2 f (v) =(cid:90) ∞

0

dv v2 exp(cid:18) Ψ − v2/2

σ2

(cid:19) ∝ eΨ/σ2

,

where σ is the velocity dispersion. The above expression highlights very clearly the interrelation

between the density and velocity distributions, through their dependence on Ψ. Using Poisson’s
equation and the fact that Ψ ∝ ln ρ, we solve for the radial dependence of the density distribution:

∇2Ψ = −4πGρ −→ ρ(r) =

σ2

2πGr2 .

Therefore, the phase-space distribution for a spherical isotropic halo in steady state is well-modeled

by

ρ(r) ∝ 1/r2

and

f (v) ∝ e−v2/σ2

.

This is precisely what is expected for a self-gravitating isothermal gas sphere! The fact that rotation

curves motivate an inverse-square fall-oﬀ for the density distribution appears to provide support for

this scenario. However, while it provides intuition, this simple picture must be augmented because

such a density proﬁle predicts an inﬁnitely massive halo. This in turn suggests that at distances

beyond current measurements, rotation curves must no longer be ﬂat.

1.3 Input from Numerical Simulations

Our estimates above relied on the fact that the Galaxy is in a steady state, which means that

the virial theorem or Jeans Theorem must apply. This is a reasonably good approximation for

the Milky Way. Observational evidence suggests that the Milky Way’s last major merger with
another galaxy occurred ∼10 Gyr ago (compared to our Galaxy’s 13 Gyr age)—see e.g., [9, 10].
A major galaxy merger is one that signiﬁcantly perturbs the Galactic disk, distorting the spiral

structure. However, minor mergers are continuing to this day, as evidenced most spectacularly by

the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy [11]. As this dwarf galaxy has been falling into the Milky Way, it

has left a tail of tidal debris in its wake, which is observed as a stream of stars in the sky that

roughly traces the expected orbit of the infalling galaxy [12–16]. This suggests that the steady-state

assumption is only approximately correct and that the merger history of the Galaxy does aﬀect the

phase-space distribution of DM.

To address this point properly requires leaving the realm of analytic (or semi-analytic) cal-

culations and turning to numerical simulations that properly model the hierarchical merging of

individual DM halos. These simulations follow structure formation, from the initial DM density

perturbations to the largest halos today. They are referred to as N-body simulations because they

keep track of the many-body gravitational interactions between DM halos as they merge together to

form ever larger structures. To date, the highest resolution simulations that model Milky-Way–like

halos (e.g., Via Lactea II [17] and Aquarius [18]) only contain DM. However, the inclusion of

baryons is likely to have important consequences. Simulations that account for the gas physics are

computationally more expensive but can result in distinct changes to the DM density and velocity

distributions, especially in baryon-rich regions. For example, adiabatic contraction leads to con-

densation of gas towards the center of the halo, which can pull the DM with it, enhancing the halo’s

central density [19, 20]. In contrast, complex feedback mechanisms from e.g., energy injection from

Active Galactic Nuclei and supernova outﬂows can eject DM away from the center of the halo— see

e.g., [21, 22]. As the numerical resolution of full hydrodynamic simulations continues to improve,

we will gain a better understanding of which of these two mechanisms wins out in our own Galaxy.

What have we learned about the DM’s density and velocity distributions from simulations so

far? First, the density distribution appears to be approximately universal and well-modeled by the

Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) proﬁle [23]:

ρNFW(r) =

ρ0

r/rs(1 + r/rs)2 ,

where rs = 20 kpc is the scale radius. Currently, we do not know how to derive the NFW proﬁle
from ﬁrst principles. Also, note that the radial dependence is diﬀerent than that for the isothermal

proﬁle, highlighting that our simple estimates from above only approximately reconstruct the more

complete picture. The Einasto proﬁle, which also appears frequently in the literature, takes the

possible that the inner proﬁle is more cored (e.g., has a ﬂatter slope) than the NFW or Einasto

proﬁles, which are described as ‘cuspy’ because of their steeper inner slopes. The Burkert proﬁle [25]

is one such example:

ρBurk(r) =

ρ0

(1 + r/rs)(1 + (r/rs)2)

,

where rs is the core radius. A comparison of the NFW, Einasto, and Burkert proﬁles is shown in
the left panel of Fig. 2. Observational evidence from dwarf galaxies (small galaxies with few stars)

may suggest cored proﬁles (see e.g., [26]). While baryonic feedback mechanisms may suﬃce in

explaining such cored proﬁles [27], they may also be due to another cause all-together—non-trivial

DM self-interactions [28].

The fact that the density distribution recovered from N-body simulations diﬀers from isothermal

tells us with certainty that the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is not the correct velocity distri-

bution. Remember that the density and velocity distributions must be self-consistent, as they are

related to each other through the gravitational potential, and a Maxwellian velocity distribution
requires ρ ∝ r−2. The right panel of Fig. 2 compares the velocity distribution obtained from the Via
Lactea N-body simulation with the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Notice that the Via Lactea

Debate continues as

to how this conclusion changes in full hydrodynamic simulations [31–33]. However, the important

point to make is that the tail of the velocity distribution is most sensitive to the merging history of

the halo. When a subhalo falls into the Galaxy, it is tidally disrupted and leaves behind remnants

that are out of equilibrium. The DM particles in these remnants are likely to have higher speeds,

on average, than the rest of the halo and will contribute to the high-velocity tail of the velocity

distribution. Therefore, the shape of the high-velocity end of the distribution depends on the size

and time of minor mergers in our own Galaxy.

Despite the caveats listed here, the distribution that is used most often in the literature is the

truncated Maxwellian, otherwise known as the Standard Halo Model:

where σv is the rms velocity dispersion, v0 =(cid:112)2/3σv ≈ 235 km/s is the most probable speed [34–
37], and Nesc = erf(z) − 2π−1/2ze−z2

, with z ≡ vesc/v0 and vesc the escape velocity.

N-body simulations also ﬁnd evidence for substructure in the DM phase-space distribution. This

includes localized features that arise from relatively recent minor mergers between the Milky Way

and other galaxies. When another DM subhalo falls into an orbit about the center of the Milky

Way, tidal eﬀects strip DM (and, possibly, stars) along its orbit. This ‘debris’ eventually virializes

with the other particles in the Milky Way’s halo. However, at any given time, there is likely to be

some fraction of this debris that has not come into equilibrium and which exhibits unique features

that may aﬀect observations. Examples of substructure include:

• Clumps: Concentrated clumps of DM may be left behind by the merging process. Each

clump would result in a localized overdensity of DM.

• Streams: A tidal stream is an example of debris left behind along the orbits of infalling
subhalos. Figure 3 is a famous image from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) known as

the ‘Field of Streams.’ The single patch of sky in this image contains several arms of the

Sagittarius stream, as well as the Orphan and Monoceros stellar streams. Evidence for stellar

streams suggests that similar features might form in the DM distribution as well. If this were

the case, then the DM velocities in a given stream would be coherent, with

fstream(v) = δ(3) (v − vstream) .

The right panel of Fig. 2 shows localized spikes in the tail of the velocity distribution, which

are associated with streams in Via Lactea.

Figure 3: The Field of Streams is a patch of sky imaged by SDSS that contains several overlapping
stellar streams [38]. The color denotes distance of the stars, with blue the most nearby and red the
farthest. The yellow and red band shows two tails of the Sagittarius stream (note the bifurcation
at RA∼180◦). The Monoceros stream is the vertical blue swath to the right of the image. The
Orphan stream is the thin vertical stripe near RA∼160◦.

• Debris Flow: Imagine what happens as many subhalos orbit about the Milky Way, each
dumping tidal debris along its path. Debris ﬂow is the sum total of the overlapping streams,

shells, and plumes of debris from these mergers. The aggregate sum of this partially virialized

material is spatially homogenous, resembling a ﬂuﬀy cloud. Despite being spread out in

position-space, its constituents retain structure in velocity-space. In particular, they share a

common speed, even though their velocities are not coherent in direction [39,40]. Simulations

suggest that debris ﬂow may comprise a signiﬁcant fraction of the high-speed particles in the

Milky Way. In the right panel of Fig. 2, debris ﬂow accounts for the excess of particles on

the tail of the Via Lactea distribution, relative to the Maxwellian expectation.

• Dark Disk: N-body simulations suggest that a dark disk may form if subhalos merging with
the Milky Way are dragged through and disrupted by the baryonic disk [41–44]. The net

result is a concentration of DM along the plane that rotates in the same direction as the Sun,
except with a lag speed of ∼50 km/s. A dark disk would enhance the local DM density and
also provide an excess of slower-moving DM particles in the Solar neighborhood. Simulations

suggest that a dark disk can lead to a factor of 0.5–2 overdensity in the local density, however

The previous section motivated properties of the astrophysical distribution of DM from measure-

ments of rotation curves. As it turns out, it is possible to make some general, model-independent

statements about the mass range by simply requiring that DM form halos. The lower bound of

allowed masses is set by the number of particles that can be conﬁned within a given cell of phase

space, which is set by the spin statistics of the particle. For example, if the DM is an ultra-light

scalar, then Bose statistics dictates that there is no limit to the number of particles that can be

packed into the same point in phase space. In this case, the occupation number of DM particles is

so high that it can eﬀectively be treated as a classical ﬁeld and the stability of the halo is set by the
uncertainty principle using ∆x ∆p ∼ 1, where ∆p ∼ mχv and ∆x ∼ 2Rhalo. The tightest bounds
come from halos surrounding dwarf galaxies, from which we estimate that a scalar DM particle

must have mass greater than

mscalar (cid:38) 10−22 eV .

Ultra-light scalar DM particles near the bottom of this bound are referred to as ‘fuzzy’ dark

matter [45].

The argument changes for fermions due to Pauli exclusion [46–48]. This means that

Mhalo = mfermV (cid:90) f (p) d3p (cid:46) mfermV (cid:90) d3p ∼ mferm R3

halo (mfermv)3 ,

where V = 4
3 πR3 is the volume of a spherical halo of radius R and mferm is the mass of the fermionic
particle. The (cid:46) arises from the fact that each unit volume of phase space can have up to, but no
more than, one fermionic particle, on average. Substituting in for the virial velocity gives

mferm (cid:38)(cid:0)G3MhaloR3

halo(cid:1)−1/8

and mferm (cid:38) O(10) eV. Generalizations of this phase-space argument lead to even tighter con-
straints. For example, the phase-space densities of dwarf galaxies suggest that

mferm (cid:38) 0.7 keV .

As expected, the bound on fermionic DM is much more stringent than that for bosonic DM.

To stress, these restrictions on the DM mass range are the most generic statements that can
be made.3 However, folding in assumptions about the evolution of the DM density in the early

Universe can motivate more speciﬁc mass scales. Let us now focus on the case where a DM particle

3The upper mass limit for DM comes from searches for MACHOs, MAssive Compact Halo Objects. Such objects
cause lensing events when they pass in front of bright stars and the lack of such detections excludes MACHOs with
masses between roughly 1057−67 eV [49–51].

is in thermal equilibrium in the early Universe via its interactions with Standard Model particles.

2.1 Thermal Dark Matter

Figure 4 shows two possible 2 → 2 interaction diagrams that are allowed with χ the DM particle
and X a Standard Model particle, which is essentially massless and in equilibrium with the photon
bath. When the interaction χχ ↔ XX is in equilibrium, the DM particles are constantly being
replenished. As the Universe expands, though, it becomes increasingly harder for a DM particle to

ﬁnd a partner to annihilate with and the forward reaction shuts oﬀ. At this point, the DM density

remains frozen in time. The ‘freeze-out’ time occurs when the annihilation rate, Γinelastic, is on the
order of the Hubble rate, H:

Γinelastic = nχ(cid:104)σv(cid:105) ∼ H ,

where nχ is the DM number density and (cid:104)σv(cid:105) is the velocity-averaged cross section. Cold DM is
non-relativistic at freeze-out, with nχ ∼ T 3/2e−mχ/T , with T the temperature of the DM species;
hot DM is relativistic at freeze-out, with nχ ∼ T 3. Warm DM falls somewhere in between these
two cases.

Exercise: The number density of a given particle is related to its phase-space density, f (E, t), via

(2.1)

where g is the number of spin degrees of freedom of the particle. Determine the scaling of n with

temperature in the non-relativistic and relativistic limits.

After freeze-out, the DM is no longer in chemical equilibrium, but it remains in thermal equi-

librium with the surrounding plasma via the elastic interaction shown in the right panel of Fig. 4.

The best-ﬁt cold(warm) DM ﬁts are shown in solid green(dashed red). The warm DM curves do a
poor job at reproducing the data at high redshift. Figure from [52].

After a certain point, however, even this interaction decouples. The elastic interaction rate,

Γelastic = nX(cid:104)σv(cid:105) ,

is proportional to nX , which scales like T 3 as the X are relativistic. For cold DM (CDM), Γelastic
exceeds the Hubble rate only after the DM has fallen out of chemical equilibrium; at this point in

time (referred to as ‘kinetic decoupling’), the DM is free streaming. In contrast, kinetic decoupling

happens earlier for hot DM.

The size of the horizon during kinetic decoupling sets a cutoﬀ scale for the DM power spectrum.

Before decoupling, the DM ﬂuid is coupled to the photon bath and perturbations are damped by

friction between the two. When the DM free streams after decoupling, it experiences collision-

less damping because the particles move in random directions due to a non-zero average velocity.

Detailed modeling of these eﬀects is somewhat involved (see the review [53] and references therein),

but the net eﬀect is to strongly suppress the perturbation spectrum below some characteristic

wavenumber (or above some free-streaming length). The hotter the DM, the lower the cutoﬀ

because its free-streaming length is larger after decoupling. Figure 5 shows the Lyman-α power

spectra measured from 25 diﬀerent high-redshift quasars in [52]. Notice that the best-ﬁt warm DM
curves poorly reproduce the power spectra at z (cid:38) 5. The study excludes thermal DM candidates
(that comprises 100% of the DM density) for masses mthermal (cid:38) 3.3 keV at 2σ conﬁdence. These
results constrain warm DM candidates, which predict less structure on small scales than is actually

Warm DM can potentially explain some inconsistencies between CDM simulations and obser-

vations on galactic scales. The three most often-cited challenges are: (1) The Missing Satellites

Problem where N-body simulations predict more satellite galaxies in orbit around the Milky Way

than are actually observed. (2) The Cusp/Core Controversy where some data from dwarf galaxies

point to a shallow central slope of the density proﬁle, not recovered in DM-only N-body simula-

tions. (3) The Too Big to Fail Problem in which we do not observe dwarf galaxies that are as large

as the ones found in simulations. Warm DM can help to resolve the ﬁrst two of these challenges, in

particular, because its longer free-streaming length (relative to CDM) washes out structure on these

scales. Debate continues as to whether these challenges can be resolved with full hydrodynamic

N-body simulations that properly include the feedback from baryonic processes [27].

2.2 Freeze Out

For the remainder of this section, we will delve more deeply into the CDM scenario, speciﬁcally. To

calculate the DM number density today, we follow the evolution of the inelastic scattering process

with time using the Boltzmann equation (1.1). This application of the Boltzmann equation requires

the covariant form of the Liouville operator, which can be written as

L[f ] = E

∂f

(2.2)

where H = ˙a/a is the expansion rate of the Universe and a is the scale factor. When there are no
number-changing DM interactions (that is, when C[f ] = 0), then (2.2) shows simply that na3 is

constant in time.

However, the evolution of the DM number density is non-trivial if the collision term exists. To
see this explicitly, consider interactions of the form 1+2 ↔ 3+4 [54]. The collision term for particle
1 is then

×(2π)4δ4(p1 + p2 − p3 − p4) dΠ1 dΠ2 dΠ3 dΠ4 ,

(2.3)

where gi and fi are the spin degrees of freedom and phase-space densities, respectively, for particle i,
and Mx→y is the matrix element for the reaction x → y. Factors of the form (1± f ) represent Pauli
blocking and Bose enhancement; the minus sign applies to fermions and the plus sign to bosons.

These terms encapsulate the fact that it is easier(harder) for a boson(fermion) to transition to a

13

state that already contains a boson(fermion). The last line of (2.3) includes a delta function that

enforces energy and momentum conservation, and the phase-space integration factors

dΠi =

d3pi

(2π)3 2Ei

.

In its current form, (2.3) is quite complicated; however, it reduces to a more manageable form

after making the following assumptions:

1. Kinetic equilibrium is maintained and so the phase-space distributions take on the Fermi-

Dirac or Bose-Einstein forms.

2. The temperature of each species satisﬁes Ti (cid:28) Ei − µi, where µi is its chemical potential, so
that they follow the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. In this case, the statistical mechanical
factors in the calculation can be ignored and (1 ± f ) ∼ 1.

3. The Standard Model particles in the interaction are in thermal equilibrium with the photon

bath.

Using the standard deﬁnition relating the cross section to the matrix element, we get

(cid:88)spins(cid:90) |Mij→kl|2 × (2π)4δ4(pi + pj − pk − pl) dΠk dΠl = 4 gigjσij(cid:113)(pi · pj)2 − (mimj)2 ,

where σij is the cross section for the scattering process. Substituting this back into the collision
term gives

g1(cid:90) C[f1]

d3p1

(2π)3 = −(cid:90) {(σvMøl)12 dn1dn2 − (σvMøl)34 dn3dn4} ,

where the Møller velocity is deﬁned as

(vMøl)ij = (cid:112)(pi · pj)2 − (mi mj)2

Ei Ej

for the ij → kl process. Because σvMøl varies slowly with changes in the number density of the
initial and ﬁnal-state particles, it can be factored out of the integrand to give

˙n1 + 3Hn1 = −(cid:104)σvMøl(cid:105)12n1n2 + (cid:104)σvMøl(cid:105)34n3n4 .

(2.4)

Note that the velocity that is used in the cross-section average is not the relative velocity, vrel, of
the incoming particles. This is important, as (vMøl)ij ninj is Lorentz invariant, whereas vrelninj
is not. From this point forward, we will simply write the Møller velocity as vMøl → v to simplify
notation.

Let us now return to the speciﬁc inelastic process illustrated in Fig. 4. In this case, particles 1

14

and 2 are identical with number density n, and particles 3 and 4 are Standard Model particles in

thermal equilibrium with the photon bath. When the DM is also in equilibrium with the SM ﬁnal

states, then detailed balance dictates that

(cid:104)σv(cid:105)12 n2

eq = (cid:104)σv(cid:105)34 neq

3 neq
4 ,

which can be used to rewrite the second term of (2.4) in terms of the DM number density and the

cross section for the forward reaction. The Boltzmann equation reduces to

˙n + 3Hn = (cid:104)σv(cid:105)(cid:0)n2

eq − n2(cid:1) ,

where (cid:104)σv(cid:105) = (cid:104)σv(cid:105)12. The DM number density, n, decreases with the expansion of the Universe
(in addition to any number-changing eﬀects from the collision term) and it is useful to scale out

this eﬀect by deﬁning the quantity Y = n/s, where s is the total entropy density of the Universe.
Substituting this into (2.5) and using the fact that sa3 is constant to get the relation that ˙s = −3sH,
yields

This equation is written in terms of the usual time variable as well as a rescaled time variable
x = m/T , where m is the mass of the DM. Note that dx/dt = H(x)x, because T ∝ 1/a (i.e.,
the photon temperature is inversely proportional to its wavelength, which scales as a).
If DM
production occurs during radiation domination, then H(x) = H(m)/x2. The precise deﬁnition of

H(m) is not necessary for our purposes here—see [55] for further discussion.

Let us take stock of where we stand: We have an expression that describes the evolution of Y

as the Universe cools. Y is the DM number density, rescaled to remove the eﬀects of the Universe’s

expansion. Therefore, the changes in Y encoded in the Boltzmann equation arise purely from

interactions of the DM with states that are in thermal equilibrium with the photon bath. The

evolution of Y is governed by the velocity-averaged cross section:

Eq. (2.7) can be further simpliﬁed by redeﬁnition of the integration variables [54], and the ﬁnal

result is

case where b0 dominates is referred to as s-wave annihilation. The case where the second term
dominates is called p-wave annihilation.

There is no analytic solution for equations that take the form of (2.6), so one must rely on

numerical solutions for exact results. However, we can consider the behavior of the solutions in

limiting cases to build intuition for how the DM number density evolves with time. Remember

that the evolution depends on how the annihilation rate compares with the expansion rate. When
Γ (cid:29) H, then the annihilation process is very eﬃcient and equilibrium can be maintained between
the DM and photon bath. However, when Γ (cid:28) H, the DM particles can no longer ﬁnd each other
fast enough compared to the expansion rate, and thus fall out of equilibrium, as illustrated in Fig. 6.

Said another way,

Y (x (cid:46) xf ) (cid:39) Yeq(x)

and

Y (x (cid:38) xf ) (cid:39) Yeq(xf ) ,

where xf is the freeze-out time. For CDM, Y (x) decreases exponentially before freeze-out. After
freeze-out, however, the abundance is larger than what its equilibrium value would have been if

freeze-out had not occurred (as Yeq is decreasing, Yeq(xf ) > Yeq(x > xf ) trivially). Therefore, (2.6)
becomes

dY
dx (cid:39) −

xn+2 Y 2 , where λ = (cid:104)σv(cid:105)0s0

.

Note that the x dependence has been pulled out of the cross section and entropy to deﬁne λ. That
is, (cid:104)σv(cid:105) = (cid:104)σv(cid:105)0 x−n and s = s0 x−3.4 Taking n = 0 as an example, we can solve for the DM
4We are assuming that either s- or p-wave annihilation dominate, which is oftentimes true. More precisely, though,

the thermally averaged cross section is a series in x, as shown in (2.8).

where the last step uses the fact that the abundance at freeze-out, Yf , is typically greater than
its value today. Of course, this result changes if the thermally averaged cross-section carries a
dependence on x, which depends on the details of the particle physics model. If n (cid:54)= 0, then Ytoday
carries higher powers of xf .

Exercise: Use the fact that neq(cid:104)σv(cid:105) ∼ H at freeze-out to estimate that xf = O(10).

taking xf ∼ 10 and (cid:104)σv(cid:105) ∼ α2/m2. Assuming a weakly interacting DM particle with α ∼ 0.01 and
mass mχ ∼ 100 GeV gives the correct abundance today as measured by Planck and WMAP [1].
The fact that weak-scale DM naturally gives the correct DM density today is known as the ‘WIMP

miracle’ and has become the dominant paradigm as many well-motivated models, such as supersym-
metry, provide such candidates.6 Such particles are known as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles,

or WIMPs. As we will discuss, there is a wide-ranging experimental program today targeting this

parameter space.

But just how much of a miracle are WIMPs? It turns out, not that much. Going back to (2.9),

notice that what is really constrained is the ratio of the squared coupling to the mass. Indeed, it is
possible to open up a wider band of allowed masses for thermal DM by taking α (cid:28) 1 while keeping
α2/m2 ﬁxed. Such scenarios are known as WIMPless DM models [57].

A separate example that easily generates DM with masses down to the keV scale is known as

Forbidden DM [58, 59]. Forbidden DM arises when the DM annihilates primarily into some new,

heavier particles

χχ → φφ ,

with mφ > mχ. Note that the φ are not Standard-Model states, but we do assume that they are in

cross section from being arbitrarily large, it is possible to set an upper limit on the mass of thermal DM to be

˙n + 3Hn = −(cid:104)σv(cid:105)χχ n2

χ + (cid:104)σv(cid:105)φφ (neq

and we proceed, as above, by rewriting this in terms of nχ and (cid:104)σv(cid:105)χχ, and solving for the DM
density today. At this point, however, we need to be more careful. When the DM annihilates to
heavier ﬁnal states, we cannot simply approximate the thermally averaged cross section (cid:104)σv(cid:105)χχ as
α2/m2
χ because important phase-space suppression factors come into play. The reverse reaction,
however, does scale as (cid:104)σv(cid:105)φφ ∼ α2/m2
φ. To relate it to (cid:104)σv(cid:105)χχ, we take advantage of the following
relation from detailed balance:

In the interesting regime when the mass diﬀerence is small but non-zero, the thermally averaged

cross section for the forward reaction is exponentially suppressed. This provides the freedom to

reduce the DM mass while still keeping the DM density at its target value (while not changing the

coupling too far from weak-scale). Forbidden DM provides a simple illustration of how a (slightly)

more complicated DM model can give the correct relic density for masses below the weak scale.
The Forbidden example still uses 2 → 2 DM interactions. Broadening this assumption can lead to
intriguing consequences as well. For example, if the relic density is set by 3 → 2 interactions, then
a strongly-interacting MeV-scale thermal relic is allowed [60, 61].

Our primary focus thus far has been understanding the starting assumptions for the astrophysical

and particle-physics properties of DM. Now, we turn to several applications of these results, focus-

ing speciﬁcally on detection strategies for WIMPs. This section will review the physics of direct

detection experiments, and the next section will focus on indirect detection.

Imagine DM ﬂying through Earth and scattering oﬀ a particle in a ground-based detector, which

then recoils with some energy ER. If the recoil energy is large enough, it may be possible to detect
the scattered particle and infer, from its kinematics, the properties of the DM that scattered oﬀ it.

The ‘direct detection’ of DM in this fashion was ﬁrst proposed by Goodman and Witten [62] and

then developed more fully by Drukier, Freese, and Spergel [63] in the mid-1980s.

If the DM scatters oﬀ a nucleus with mass mN , then the nuclear recoil energy is

ER =

mN (cid:19) ,

where q ∼ mχv is the momentum transfer in the collision and v ∼ 10−3 is the (non-relativistic)
speed of the incoming DM.7 Let us take as an example the LUX [67] and Xenon100 [68] experiments,
which use a Xenon target with mass mN ∼ 120 GeV. These experiments have energy thresholds
∼few keV, so (3.1) tells us that their sensitivity degrades for mχ (cid:46) 10 GeV. However, they are
optimal for detecting DM with mχ ∼ 100 GeV, where ER is on the order of ∼tens of keV.

The kinetic energy of an incident DM particle with mass of 100 GeV is ∼10 keV, which is much
smaller than the order 1–10 MeV nuclear binding energy of an atomic target. As a result, we need

only consider the scattering of the DM oﬀ the nucleus as a whole (as opposed to its constituents).

3.1 Scattering Rate

The basic quantity of interest is the scattering rate of the DM particle oﬀ the nuclear target. The

diﬀerential rate per unit detector mass is

dR

where nχ = ρχ/mχ is the DM number density and dσ/dER is the diﬀerential scattering cross
section. The brackets indicate an average over the velocities of the incoming DM. Written out in

full, the diﬀerential rate is

dR
dER

=

ρχ

mχ mN (cid:90) vmax

vmin

d3v v ˜f (v, t)

dσ

,

(3.2)

where ˜f (v, t) is the DM velocity distribution in the lab frame, vmax is the escape velocity, and
vmin is the minimum velocity needed to cause a nucleus to scatter with energy ER. Measurements
of the fastest stars in the Galaxy bound the escape velocity to be within 498–608 km/s, to 90%

conﬁdence [69].

The lab-frame velocity distribution is obtained by applying a Galilean boost to the Galactic-

frame distribution, f (v):

˜f (v) = f (v + vobs (t)) , where vobs (t) = v(cid:12) + V⊕ (t) ,

v(cid:12) is the velocity of the Sun relative to the DM reference frame [70, 71], and V⊕(t) is the veloc-
ity of the Earth about the Sun.8 For reference, v(cid:12) ∼ 220 km/s and V⊕ ∼ 30 km/s. To good
approximation,

vobs(t) ≈ v(cid:12) (1 +  cos [ω(t − t0)] + ··· )

7For sub-GeV DM, scattering oﬀ electrons in the target, rather than nuclei, is more relevant.

In this case,
evaluation of the scattering rate is more involved as one must account for the fact that the electron is in a bound
state. We point the interested reader to [64–66] for further details.

8There are errors in the formula of the Earth’s velocity scattered throughout the literature. For the updated value,

see [72].

where ω = 2π/year, t0 is the phase of the modulation, and  is the ratio of (cid:101)V⊕/v(cid:12). Here, (cid:101)V⊕ is the

component of the Earth’s velocity in the Sun’s direction. Because  (cid:28) 1, the velocity distribution
can be Taylor expanded as

f (v + vobs(t)) (cid:39) f (v + v(cid:12)) +  cos [ω(t − t0)] f(cid:48)(v + v(cid:12)) + ···

and the rate equation takes the form

dR
dEnr

= A0 + A1 cos [ω (t − t0)] + ··· .

(3.3)

The ﬁrst term (A0) is the unmodulated rate and the second term (A1) describes the annual modula-
tion of the signal, which we will come back to later. The higher order terms in the expansion may be
relevant in cases where the DM is light ((cid:46) 10 GeV) or in the presence of velocity substructure [72],
but we will not discuss them here.

Calculating the rate requires knowing vmin, which depends on the kinematics of the scattering
event. We consider the general case χ + N → χ(cid:48) + N , where χ(cid:48) is an excited state of the DM
particle with mass mχ + δ. Note that the elastic scattering regime is recovered when δ → 0. In
some models, the inelastic process may dominate, so we will work out the general form for vmin
here for reference. In the non-relativistic limit, the initial momenta in the lab frame are

pµ = (mN , 0)

and

kµ =(cid:18)mχ +

mχv2, mχv, 0, 0(cid:19)

for the nucleus and DM, respectively. (The corresponding momenta for the ﬁnal states are denoted

with primes.) It is often more convenient to use the momentum transfer q and the total momentum

P,

and to deﬁne

q = p(cid:48) − p = k − k(cid:48)

and P = p(cid:48) + p = q + 2p ,

qµ =(cid:16)ER,(cid:112)2mN ER cos θ,(cid:112)2mN ER sin θ, 0(cid:17) ,

where θ is the scattering angle of the nucleus in the lab frame.

Exercise: Show that

q · (k − p) − q2 = ER (mχ + mN ) − mχv(cid:112)2mN ER cos θ = −mχ δ .

increases(decreases) as mN (mχ) increases, as our intuition would suggest. Additionally, vmin is
larger for inelastic scattering events.

shortly), then the unmodulated rate is approximately

assumptions about the cross section and velocity distribution. Figure 7 shows a sketch of the

integration region for a given target. The left(right) panels are examples for lower(higher) DM

mass. Clearly, as the DM mass increases, the rate is larger as the integration region is larger.

Notice that in the case of light DM, when vmin is large, the rate becomes very sensitive to the tail
of the velocity distribution, which, as we already discussed, can be quite uncertain.

9Note that δ can be negative in the case of an exothermic interaction [73].

3.2 Diﬀerential Scattering Cross Section

Now, we turn to deriving the diﬀerential scattering cross section for the DM-nucleus interaction,

taking an eﬀective operator approach [75, 76]. Let us assume that the DM is a spin-1/2 Dirac

fermion that interacts with quarks via a scalar or vector boson φ with mass mφ. The scattering
process is described by the eﬀective four-fermion interaction:

Leﬀ = g(q2, mφ) ¯χ Γχ χ ¯Q ΓQ Q ,

where Q represents the quark ﬁelds, Γχ,Q = {I, γ5, γµ, γµγ5, σµν, σµνγ5}, and g(q2, mφ) is an eﬀec-
φ for contact interactions (q2 (cid:28) m2
tive coupling. In particular, g(q2, mφ) is proportional to 1/m2
φ),
or 1/q2 for long-range interactions (q2 (cid:29) m2

φ). We then proceed as follows:

1. Map the quark operator to a nucleon operator and use this to obtain the amplitude for

DM-nucleus scattering, M.

2. Take the non-relativistic limit of the scattering amplitude, Mnr.
3. Relate this to the diﬀerential cross section by averaging/summing initial and ﬁnal-state spins:

dσ
dER

=

2mN

πv2 (cid:68)|Mnr|2(cid:69) ,

where v is the relative velocity between the DM and nucleus.

As a ﬁrst example, consider the eﬀective Lagrangian

Leﬀ = gφ ¯χ χ ¯Q Q

(3.5)

for contact interactions where gφ is independent of the momentum transfer. To rewrite the quark

These terms are related to the nucleon mass using the trace of the QCD energy-momentum tensor—

for further details, see [77]. The fraction of the proton mass accounted for by a particular quark

ﬁelds in terms of nucleon ﬁelds (labeled n, p), we must evaluate operators of the form(cid:10)n(cid:12)(cid:12) ¯QQ(cid:12)(cid:12) n(cid:11).
Tq ≡(cid:10)p(cid:12)(cid:12)mq ¯QQ(cid:12)(cid:12) p(cid:11), and the coupling of the DM to the protons is given by

Tq [78]. A similar relation applies to the DM coupling to neutrons,
Tq are determined experimentally, so fp,n are

M = fp ¯χ χ ¯p p + fn ¯χ χ ¯n n .

Because the momentum transfer is small enough that the nucleon structure cannot be resolved, no

form factors need to be included here. In many models, the DM couples to protons and neutrons
with the same strength, so that fp ≈ fn. However, isospin-dependent scenarios have also been
considered in the literature [79].

Because ¯pp and ¯nn give the proton and neutron count, respectively, it is straightforward to

rewrite M in terms of the ﬁelds for the nuclei:

M = [Zfp + (A − Z)fn] ¯χ χ ¯N ΓN N ,

where Z is the atomic number, A is the mass number, and ΓN is a Lorentz-invariant 4×4 matrix.
Because the ﬁnal answer can only depend on qµ and Pµ, there are a limited number of possibilities
for ΓN :

¯N ΓN N = ¯N N ˜F1(q2) + ¯N γµN qµ ˜F2(q2) + ¯N γµN Pµ ˜F3(q2) + ¯N σµνN qµPν ˜F4(q2) ,

(3.7)

where ˜Fi(q2) are nuclear form factors. At small momentum transfers, the DM does not probe the
size of the nucleus and the cross section is unaﬀected. However, as the momentum transfer increases,

the interactions become sensitive to the size of the nucleus and the cross section is diminished. This
eﬀect is encoded in the form factors. The Dirac equation tells us that γµpµN (p) = mN N (p) and
¯N (p(cid:48))γµp(cid:48)µ = mN ¯N (p(cid:48)), which means that the second term in (3.7) vanishes, while all others are
proportional to ¯N N . Therefore,

M = [Zfp + (A − Z)fn] ¯χ χ ¯N N F (q2) ,

(3.8)

where F (q2) is a linear combination of the ˜Fi’s. For interactions such as this one that are coherent
over the entire nucleus, the form factor is approximately the Fourier transform of the nucleus’ mass

distribution. It is commonly given by the Helm form factor [80]:

F (q) = 3e−q2s2/2 sin(q rn) − q rn cos(q rn)

(q rn)3

where the eﬀective nuclear radius is r2

3 π2a2 − 5s2, with a (cid:39) 0.52 fm, s (cid:39) 0.9 fm, and

n = c2 + 7

23

Next, we want to ﬁnd the non-relativistic limit of the amplitude (3.8). Remember that Dirac

ﬁelds are given by

N s(p) =(cid:32) √p · σ ξs
√p · ¯σ ξs (cid:33) ,

where s is the spin index and ξs is the two-component spinor satisfying (cid:80)spins ξs†ξs = 1. In the
non-relativistic limit, p0 ≈ mN and

√p · σ ≈ √mN − p · σ ≈ √mN(cid:18)1 −

p · σ

2mN(cid:19) .

The same applies for the χ ﬁelds, except with appropriate substitutions for mass and momenta.

Therefore,

¯N s(cid:48)(p(cid:48))N s(p) = (N s(cid:48)(p(cid:48)))†γ0N s(p)

= (cid:16)(cid:112)p(cid:48) · σ ξs(cid:48)† ,(cid:112)p(cid:48) · ¯σ ξs(cid:48)†(cid:17)(cid:32) 0 1

1 0 (cid:33)(cid:32) √p · σ ξs
√p · ¯σ ξs (cid:33)

where s(s(cid:48)) is the spin index for the incoming(outgoing) nucleus. Similarly, ¯χχ ≈ 2mχ ξr(cid:48)†ξr in the
non-relativistic limit, where r(r(cid:48)) is the spin index for the incoming(outgoing) DM. Dropping the
factors of 2mχ and 2mN , which are relativistic normalizations, gives

Mnr = [Zfp + (A − Z)fn] F (q2) ξs(cid:48)†ξs ξr(cid:48)†ξr .

(3.9)

24

There are a few important points to note regarding (3.9). First, when fp = fn, the diﬀerential cross
section is proportional to A2. In this case, the DM couples coherently to the entire nucleus and

the strength of the scattering interaction increases with the mass number of the nucleus. Second,

eﬀective interactions such as (3.5) are referred to as ‘spin-independent’ because the scattering cross

section does not depend on the nuclear spin. Spin-independent interactions of the form of (3.5)

are often cited in the literature because they arise naturally in models of supersymmetry with

neutralino DM. Third, the scattering cross section is independent of the recoil energy and thus the

diﬀerential rate is a falling exponential.

It is important to keep in mind that the example above is not generic and, indeed, predictions

for the diﬀerential rate can change markedly by analyzing diﬀerent eﬀective interactions. For
instance, consider what happens when gφ ∝ 1/q2 ∝ 1/ER in (3.5). It is convenient to factor out
the momentum dependence from (3.6) and introduce a DM form factor, FDM(ER) ∝ E−1
R , that
multiplies the amplitude. In this case, the diﬀerential cross section is proportional to dσ/dER ∝
E−2
R , and the scattering rate is enhanced at small recoil energies, relative to the case of contact
interactions.

It is also possible for the recoil spectrum to be suppressed at low energies, rather than enhanced.

Consider, as an example,

Leﬀ = gφ ¯χ γ5 χ ¯Q Q .

The amplitude in this case is nearly identical to what we calculated above for the scalar operator,

except for

¯χr(cid:48)(k(cid:48))γ5χr(k) = (χr(cid:48)(k(cid:48)))†γ0γ5χr(k)

= (cid:16)√k(cid:48) · σ ξr(cid:48)† ,√k(cid:48) · ¯σ ξr(cid:48)†(cid:17)(cid:32) 0 1

which needs to be expanded to higher order in the momentum transfer. Therefore, the non-
relativistic amplitude is proportional to q and the scattering amplitude goes as q2, or dσ/dER ∝ ER.
In other cases, the diﬀerential cross section may depend on the spin of the nucleus. The typical

example for spin-dependent interactions is

coupling of the DM to the proton(neutron), and (cid:104)Sp(n)(cid:105) is the average spin contribution of the pro-
ton(neutron). Importantly, the spin-dependent form factor is diﬀerent than the spin-independent

form factor—see [77] for further discussion. Notice that the spin-dependent interaction is no longer
coherent with the nucleus and (3.10) does not scale as A2. As a result, spin-dependent interactions

are more challenging to observe experimentally and the current bounds are weaker than those from

spin-independent interactions.

Figure 8 is a compilation of results from current direct detection experiments (solid lines), as

well as projections for future experiments (dotted/dashed lines) [82]. The limits are plotted for
the canonical spin-independent scenario with Leﬀ ∝ ¯χχ ¯QQ and a heavy mediator. Because the
diﬀerent experiments use a variety of target nuclei, it is not ideal to compare the DM-nucleus cross

section, σSI, between experiments. Instead, we factor out the dependence on the target nucleus
and use the DM-nucleon cross section, σp. The two are related by

masses mχ (cid:46) 10 GeV due to the energy thresholds of the experiments. Across all experiments, the
sensitivity is optimal ∼50–100 GeV, and then weakens towards higher DM mass because the DM
number density scales as 1/mχ. The most sensitive experiments are currently starting to probe
DM-nucleon cross sections ∼10−45 cm2, which is in the range expected for DM that interacts with
the nucleus via the exchange of a Higgs boson.

Exercise: Show that Higgs exchange between the DM and nucleus is a spin-independent interac-
tion and estimate the magnitude of the scattering cross section.

Below the thick orange band in Fig. 8, coherent neutrino scattering becomes relevant and the ex-

periments are no longer background-free [81]. The shaded regions in Fig. 8 correspond to detections

of excess events. It is challenging to interpret these as DM detections given that other experiments

simultaneously exclude the same regions of parameter space, however we will not delve into this

debate here. Note that limit plots such as Fig. 8 usually assume the Standard Halo Model and

the results can look diﬀerent if the velocity distribution is varied. It is feasible to present limits

independent of astrophysical assumptions—see e.g., [83–85].

3.3 Annual Modulation

Let us return back to (3.2) and discuss the time-dependence of the scattering rate, which arises from
boosting the velocity distribution into the lab frame [63].11 The details of the calculations can be

11Daily modulation signals can also be relevant. For example, a daily modulation may be observable in the direction
of the scattered nucleus, as originally pointed out in [87]. Another possibility is that the total scattering rate may
modulate daily due to the rotation of the Earth about its axis; the exposure needed to detect this is roughly equivalent
to that of detecting higher-order modes in the annual modulation.

27

SunEarthDM WindJune 1 Sept 1 March 1 Dec 1 Wednesday, July 31, 13found in articles such as [72, 74, 88], but we will focus primarily on an illustrative explanation here.

The DM has no preferred direction of motion in the Galactic rest frame. In the lab frame, however,

the DM velocities are oriented opposite to the motion of the Sun (but with roughly equivalent

speed). Therefore, there is a ‘wind’ of DM in the Solar frame, as illustrated in Fig. 9. In June, the

Earth moves towards this wind and an observer sees more high-velocity particles than when the

Earth moves away from the wind in December. As a result, the ﬂux of DM is larger in the summer,
compared to the winter,12 resulting in the annual modulation captured by the second term in (3.3).

The story is not quite this simple, though, and it turns out that an additional eﬀect called

‘gravitational focusing’ may alter the modulation phase [86]. This focusing arises from the fact

that a DM particle traveling past the Sun is pulled closer to it by their mutual gravitational

attraction. The net result is an enhancement in the DM phase-space distribution in March, when

the Earth is behind the Sun (relative to the wind), as compared to September when it is in front—

as illustrated in Fig. 9. The modulation from gravitational focusing competes with that from the

Earth’s orbit, and the observed phase is determined by which eﬀect is stronger. In general, the

slower the DM travels, the larger the eﬀect on its trajectory and the more the phase shifts away

from June/Dec and closer to Mar/Sep. Imagine, for instance, that a DM particle is detected and

the modulated scattering rate is measured in several energy bins. The phase in the highest-energy

bins will be closely aligned with June/Dec, but will shift closer to Mar/Sep in the lower-energy bins.

The expected energy dependence of the phase is well understood theoretically for DM scattering,

and can thus play an important role in distinguishing a potential signal from background.

4 Application 2: Indirect Detection

Next, we turn to the class of DM searches referred to as indirect detection. The goal of these

experiments is to detect the products of DM annihilation in our Galaxy, or beyond. While DM

annihilation is strongly suppressed after thermal freeze-out, it can still occur today and one can

maximize the chance of discovery by searching in regions of very high DM density. Depending

on the theoretical model, the DM can either annihilate directly into a pair of photons, or into

other Standard Model states that produce photons in secondary interactions. The gamma-rays

then propagate essentially unperturbed, to (hopefully) be detected by a satellite or ground-based

telescope on Earth.

12The exception is for DM particles with speeds below ∼200 km/s, which have a phase peaked in winter. See [72]

for further discussion.

4.1 Photon Flux from Annihilations

The photon ﬂux Φ from DM annihilation is proportional to the annihilation rate

n2
χ (cid:104)σv(cid:105) ∼ (ρχ/mχ)2 (cid:104)σv(cid:105) ,

as well as the number of photons produced in each such reaction, which varies depending on the

ﬁnal-state products. Therefore, the ﬂux is also proportional to dN/dEγ, which describes the number
of photons at a given energy produced in an interaction. The photon ﬂux is thus

Φ(E, ψ) =

4π (cid:90) dΩ(cid:90)l.o.s.

where r is the radial distance between the annihilation event and the Galactic Center. The inte-

gration sums up contributions of all annihilations along a given line-of-sight, (cid:96) (l.o.s), oriented an

angle ψ away from the Galactic plane. An observation along a line-of-sight essentially scans over

some solid angle, dΩ, in that direction, and the calculated ﬂux is averaged over this solid angle.

Note that (4.1) must be multiplied by a factor of 1/2 if the DM is not its own antiparticle.

Exercise: How would (4.1) change for the case of DM decay rather than annihilation?

All the astrophysical uncertainties in the determination of the ﬂux are absorbed by the J-factor,

J =

1

∆Ω(cid:90) dΩ(cid:90)l.o.s.

d(cid:96) ρ [r((cid:96), ψ)]2 .

The larger the J-factor, the more interesting the astrophysical target is for DM annihilation. The
J-factors for dwarf galaxies are roughly J ∼ 1019−20 GeV2/cm5. For our nearest neighbor, the
Andromeda galaxy, J ∼ 1020 GeV2/cm5. For our own Galactic Center, J ∼ 1022−25 GeV2/cm5
(1022−24) within 0.1◦(1◦) [89].13 Choosing an ideal target involves carefully balancing the size of

therefore some of the cleanest systems to search for DM because they contain very few stars and

little gas. In contrast, a signal from the center of the Galaxy, while enhanced due to the DM density

and proximity, has to contend with large systematic uncertainties on the astrophysical backgrounds.

the velocity-averaged cross section can be pulled out of the integral. However, this cannot be

done if the cross section depends strongly on velocity, as is the case for p-wave annihilation or

Sommerfeld enhancements (which we will come back to later). The kinematics of the annihilation

event determine the basic properties of the photon energy spectrum. Consider, ﬁrst, the case where
the DM annihilates directly into one or two photons: χχ → γX, where X = γ, Z, H or some other

where Eγ is the energy of the outgoing photon in the center-of-mass frame and mX is the mass
of the X state. To get the expression on the right-hand-side, we assume that the energy of the

outgoing photon is k = mχ + δ and expand in the mass diﬀerence δ. The γγ ﬁnal state results
in a monochromatic energy line at the DM mass. For a γZ ﬁnal state, the gamma line is still

monochromatic, but is shifted to lower energies.

The blue lines in Figure 10 show the energy spectrum for a γγ ﬁnal state where the measured

energy resolution is ∆E/E = 0.15 (solid) or 0.02 (dotted). The observation of such a gamma-ray

‘line’ would be spectacular evidence for DM annihilation. However, the production of a pair of

gamma-rays is typically loop-suppressed (and therefore sub-dominant) in many theories. The red

lines in Fig. 10 illustrate how the spectrum changes if photons are radiated oﬀ of virtual charged

particles in the loop. Such ‘virtual internal bremsstrahlung’ results in a broadening of the line

towards lower masses, though the spectrum still cuts oﬀ at the DM mass. The green lines in

Fig. 10 illustrate the box spectrum, which arises when the DM annihilates to a new state φ (e.g.,
χχ → φφ) that then decays to a photon pair (φ → γγ) [90].

Another possibility is that the DM annihilates to leptons, gauge bosons, or quarks, which may

produce secondary photons either through ﬁnal-state radiation or in the shower of their decay

radiation, and must be determined with Monte Carlo tools like Pythia8 [92].14
In the case of

secondary photon production, the energy spectrum does not have a very distinctive shape, and

one must search for a continuum excess over the background. The gray band in Fig. 10 shows an

example of the spectrum for annihilation to quarks or gauge bosons.

The details of the annihilation mechanism are buried in the velocity-averaged cross section
(cid:104)σv(cid:105). This cross section is the same in many simple models as what appears in the relic density
calculation. As a result, one can argue that indirect detection is the best probe of the thermal DM

hypothesis. In addition, we automatically have an interesting target scale for the cross section:
3 × 10−26 cm3 s−1. This regime is currently being probed by the best gamma-ray observatories
today. For example, the Fermi Large Area Telescope has searched for signals of DM annihilation

in the Milky Way’s dwarf galaxies [94]. Figure 11 shows the limits from their most recent analysis,
assuming annihilation to b¯b (left) and τ ¯τ (right). (Remember, the assumption of the ﬁnal decay
products aﬀects dN/dEγ.) Such limits are typically presented in terms of the velocity-averaged
cross section and the DM mass. The dashed black line shows the median expected limit with 68%

and 95% conﬁdence bands in green and yellow, respectively. The observed limit with six years of

data is shown by the solid black line. The horizontal dotted black line shows the thermal relic cross

section, to guide the eye. Notice that the observed bounds are starting to push into the parameter

regime that is highly motivated for WIMP dark matter.

As an example of how this story can change if (cid:104)σv(cid:105) is no longer constant in velocity, let us con-
sider scenarios where DM self-interactions are allowed. In such cases, some very interesting non-

relativistic eﬀects can arise that drastically alter the energy spectrum for the annihilation process.

In certain instances, this can make the diﬀerence between discovering the DM or not [95, 96]. The

general idea is illustrated in Fig. 12. Assume that the annihilation of the DM into SM ﬁnal states

is a localized interaction—say, at the origin. If there are no self-interactions between the DM par-

ticles, then the annihilation process looks like the left panel of Fig. 12. In this case, the probability
of ﬁnding the DM particles at the origin is just |ψ0(0)|2, where ψ0 is the incoming wave function
and a solution to the non-relativistic Schr¨odinger equation.

If self-interactions are allowed by the theory, then one possibility is that the DM particle can

interact with itself via a long-range force before annihilating. For example, if we introduce a new

scalar φ that couples to the DM via ¯χχφ, then the two χ legs of the diagram can exchange multiple

φ states before the hard annihilation occurs at the origin. The exchange of multiple mediators

alters the wave function of the incoming DM particles so that the probability of ﬁnding them at
the annihilation site is now |ψ(0)|2, where ψ is the modiﬁed wave function in the presence of the
interaction potential. This is known as the Sommerfeld enhancement.

The Sommerfeld enhancement is deﬁned as the ratio of probabilities of ﬁnding the DM at the

origin in the presence of the potential, relative to no potential:

S = |ψ(0)|2
|ψ0(0)|2 .

To calculate ψ(r), one must evaluate the ladder diagram in the right panel of Fig. 12. This

diagram is non-perturbative and determining ψ(0) would be a much more challenging problem if

we could not treat the DM system non-relativistically. Fortunately, we can and ψ(r) is obtained

by solving the Schr¨odinger equation for the non-relativistic eﬀective potential that describes the

interaction [97–100].

Let us jump into the details now and explore the interesting phenomenology of such processes.

The wave function, ψ, for two-particle scattering is described by the time-independent Schr¨odinger

equation

is the center-of-mass energy. Note the change in notation—ψ now refers to the wave function for

a single particle of mass µ (that describes the full non-relativistic two-DM state) scattering oﬀ the

l (θ, φ) =(cid:88)l

The solutions are separable and the angular equation gives Y m

l (θ, φ) proportional to the associated
Legendre function. Note that the azimuthal dependence vanishes due to the symmetry of the

problem. We are left with the following equation for the radial term, Rkl(r):

therefore, only the l = 0 term is relevant at the origin. As a result, we can focus on the scenario of s-

wave scattering and consider only the l = 0 partial wave. To simplify notation, we take uk,l=0 = uk
in the following.

The radial Schr¨odinger equation for arbitrary r becomes

which can be solved numerically for uk(r) subject to the boundary condition that the outgoing wave
be spherical. Figure 13 shows the result of such an evaluation. There are a few pertinent features

of the Sommerfeld enhancement that are worth highlighting. First, the enhancement is velocity-
dependent and increases as the relative velocity decreases from 10−1 to 10−3. At even smaller
relative velocities, a distinct resonance structure appears; for masses that yield such resonances,

the Sommerfeld factor is strongly enhanced. It turns out to be fairly straightforward to understand

this behavior if we study (4.5) in certain limits where analytic solutions are possible.

In the limit where mφ → 0, we obtain the Coulomb potential and (4.2) can be solved exactly

by transforming to parabolic coordinates:

Φ(ξ) = A M (iλ; 1; ikξ) −→ ψ(r, z) = A M (iλ; 1; ik(r − z)) eikz ,

where λ = αµ/k. The hypergeometric function has the property that M (a; b; 0) = 1, so the
probability of ﬁnding the particle at the origin is |ψ|2 = |A|2. The probability of ﬁnding the
particle in the incident beam is

|ψ(r, z)|2 → |A|2 eπλ

|Γ(1 − iλ)|2 ,

where we used the asymptotic form of the hypergeometric function (|k ξ| → ∞). Note that this is
equivalent to the probability of ﬁnding the particle at the origin if there were no potential. Because

For both repulsive and attractive interactions, S → 1 as v → ∞, which makes intuitive sense as
the two particles pass by each other too quickly to be aﬀected by the potential. In the repulsive
case (α > 0), S → 0 as v → 0 because the potential pushes the two particles apart, inhibiting their
interaction. However, in the attractive case (α < 0), S → 2πα/v and the enhancement grows as
the relative velocity decreases!

This enhancement does not grow arbitrarily large with decreasing v, however. This is because

the kinetic energy term in (4.5) eventually becomes subdominant to the potential attraction between

the two particles and bound states form. To better quantify when this transition occurs, we rewrite
the Schr¨odinger equation by introducing the new variable x ≡ mφr and expanding the Yukawa

Therefore, the DM bound states form only for discrete values of the DM masses in the ratio 1 : 4 : 9

and so on [102]. The resonance peaks in Fig. 13 do indeed satisfy this relation.

Having built intuition for the Sommerfeld mechanism in the case of the Yukawa potential, let

us now brieﬂy discuss the procedure that one must follow to evaluate S for arbitrary potentials.

This calculation is a standard non-relativistic scattering problem and is reviewed in many quan-

tum mechanics texts, so we will only outline the procedure here. In general, the solution to the

Schr¨odinger equation (4.3) must take the asymptotic form

ψ(r, θ) → eikz + f (θ)

assuming that the incoming wave is described by ψ0(r) = eikz and the scattered wave is spherical.

in order for (4.3) to take the form (4.8) in the asymptotic limit. Therefore, the wave function
15Note that writing down the asymptotic form of Rkl(r) requires that V (r) → 0 faster than 1/r as r → ∞. This
assumption is not valid for the Coulomb potential, which is why we needed to solve the Schr¨odinger equation exactly
in that case.

Remembering that only the l = 0 term contributes at the origin, the expression for the Sommerfeld

enhancement becomes

and the problem reduces to evaluating the l = 0 partial wave of the radial wave function at the

origin.

Our discussion so far has only dealt with the case of a one-state system, where each ‘rung’ on
the ladder diagram is the same: χ ¯χ → χ ¯χ. In some models, however, new states that are nearly
degenerate to the DM may exist, in which case they could also contribute to the interactions [103].
For instance, consider what happens when a new charged particle χ± that is nearly degenerate
with the DM is introduced. In this case, the ladder diagram can be built up from diﬀerent rungs:

χ ¯χ → χ ¯χ , χ ¯χ → χ+χ− , χ+χ− → χ ¯χ

and

χ+χ− → χ+χ− ,

where the mediator in each rung varies depending on the interacting particles. For this two-state

system, the Schr¨odinger equation is the same as above, except that the potential V(r) and radial
wave function Rkl become 2 × 2 matrices of the form

where each V kl
ij (r) describes the eﬀective potential between the ij initial state and kl ﬁnal state,
given by the radial wave function Rkl
ij (r). Note that ‘0’ is shorthand for χ and ‘±’ is shorthand
for χ±. The wino is a supersymmetric DM candidate that provides a classic example of a two-
state system where Sommerfeld enhancement plays an integral role [29, 104].16 In order for the
wino to be a thermal relic, its mass must be ∼3 TeV. The possibility of observing the ﬁnal-state
annihilation products for such heavy winos is very challenging. However, the cross section is
Sommerfeld enhanced due to the exchange of W ± and Z0 bosons. Indeed, it is only because of this

5 Summary

The goal of these lectures was to provide the reader with the basics of DM theory. As we have seen,

the last few decades have brought great progress in the understanding of DM. Well-motivated

hypotheses, such as WIMPs, have provided a starting point for experimental exploration and

current experiments are reaching the necessary sensitivities to discover or exclude these candidates.

However, weak-scale DM is not a guarantee; as discussed, a broad range of interactions and mass

scales are allowed. A diverse experimental program is therefore crucial for success. These lectures

focused speciﬁcally on direct and indirect detection experiments as examples, but there are many

more—including collider, axion, and beam-dump experiments. Each approach is complementary

and has the potential to provide a unique window into the dark sector. Hopefully, the interested

reader will feel emboldened to pursue these topics in greater depth, ready for whatever surprises

lay ahead.
