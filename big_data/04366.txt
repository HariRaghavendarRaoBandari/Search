A variety of options for interpreting the DØ state, X(5568), are examined. We ﬁnd that threshold,
cusp, molecular, and tetraquark models are all unfavoured. Several experimental tests for unravelling
the nature of the signal are suggested.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The X(5568), recently discovered at DØ [1], is the ﬁrst
candidate for a hadron with four distinct quark ﬂavours,
su¯b ¯d. Its reported mass and width,

M = 5567.8 ± 2.9+0.9−1.9 MeV,
Γ = 21.9 ± 6.4+5.0−2.5 MeV,

s π+, where the radiative decay B∗

assume the two-body decay Bsπ+ in S-wave, which im-
plies it is a 0+ state. Another possibility is the decay
s → Bsγ pro-
chain B∗
duces an undetected photon; in this case X(5568) is 1+
and its mass is larger than the above by the mass diﬀer-
ence B∗

s − Bs = 48.6+1.8−1.6 MeV.

While X(5568) joins a growing number of exotic states
discovered in recent years [2, 3], in this paper we will ar-
gue that, even by recent standards, it is a very unusual
state. Among the diverse range of explanations which
have been applied to other states, none seems a natu-
ral ﬁt for X(5568). Already several proposals have been
advanced, and we comment further on these below.

In Sec. II we consider various weak coupling scenar-
ios. The most prosaic possibility is that X(5568) is a
threshold enhancement (Sec. II A), arising from compe-
tition between the rapid growth in rate as phase space
opens up, and rate suppression due to hadronic overlaps.
The idea oﬀers a natural explanation for peaks above
two-body thresholds [4], but in the case of X(5568) it
does not ﬁt the data.

In the cusp scenario (Sec. II B) sharp features arise
due to singularities in loop diagrams. It oﬀers a viable
explanation [5], recently supported by lattice QCD [6],
for the Zb and Zc states, and more recently has been
s π → Bsπ
applied to the Pc states [7, 8]. We consider B∗
rescattering, as in ref.
[9], and although we are able to
ﬁt the data well, this requires unnatural parameters, and
in any case, we do not expect scattering in this channel
to be signiﬁcant.

The molecular hypothesis (Sec. II C) does not look
promising from the outset. The idea oﬀers a natural
explanation for states slightly below two-body thresh-
olds, particularly for hadron pairs which couple via pion
exchange, such as X(3872) [10–12], Y (4260) [13] and
Pc(4450) [14–17]. Since X(5568) is hundreds of MeV

below any such thresholds, it is not an obvious candidate
for a hadronic molecule. The B ¯K scenario has been dis-
cussed [18], but model calculations do not support the
required deep binding [19–21]. We consider an alterna-
tive in which the molecule arises due to the B ¯K → Bsπ
interaction, ﬁnding an attractive potential which is how-
ever not strong enough to form the desired state.

In Sec. III we consider the more exotic tetraquark ex-
planation, beginning (Sec. III A) with the question of the
mass. Tetraquark models have been widely applied to all
of the exotic mesons mentioned above, and many more
besides, and most recently have been applied to X(5568)
[22–28]. We make several simple estimates and ﬁnd that
X(5568) is too light to be a plausible tetraquark candi-
date.

Setting aside the diﬃculty with the mass, we explore
the phenomenology of the tetraquark scenario. Unlike
the various weak coupling scenarios, as a tetraquark
X(5568) would be accompanied by a pair of neutral part-
ners in the same mass region (Sec. III B). Depending on
isospin mixing there would either be a degenerate state
in Bsπ0 and very narrow partner stable to strong decay,
or a pair of states in Bsπ0, one heavier, one lighter, and
both narrower than X(5568).

There would also be a proliferation of other part-
ners, both isovector and isoscalar, with diﬀerent spin
(Sec. III C). We ﬁnd characteristic diﬀerences in the
spectra for quark and diquark models, but a feature
common to both is that the lightest states are an ap-
proximately degenerate 0+/1+ pair: hence regardless of
whether X(5568) is itself scalar or axial, it must have a
further nearby partner. Additional heavier partners are
also expected, and due to a lack of strong decay channels
most of these partners would be remarkably narrow.

II. WEAK COUPLING SCENARIOS

In principle it is possible the X signal arises due to
a variety of weak couplings eﬀects. For example, the
structure could be a weakly bound resonance in analogy
with the deuteron or the X(3872). Alternatively, the
signal could be due to simple “kinematical” eﬀects, such
as a threshold enhancement or a cusp eﬀect. We examine
these scenarios in turn.

Rate enhancements often appear near hadronic thresh-
s −
olds because (endothermic) processes behave as (
MC−MD)1/2+L where particles C and D appear in the ﬁ-
nal state with relative angular momentum L. This sharp
rise is then attenuated over a scale ΛQCD due to overlaps
of the relevant hadronic wavefunctions. Such eﬀects are
ubiquitous in hadronic physics[4]. Figure 1 displays the
(uncut) DØ data (points), the resonance signal extracted
by DØ (dashed line), and two model threshold eﬀects.
The dotted line is an S-wave model chosen to peak near
5568 MeV. This exhibits the characteristic fast rise, in
apparent contradiction with the data. We remark that
the scale used to attenuate the reaction was chosen to be
substantially smaller than usual[29] in an attempt to ﬁt
the observed signal. The solid line displays the analogous
P-wave model, which also does not ﬁt the data well. Be-
cause a similar pattern holds for all waves, we conclude
that it is unlikely that the X signal can be explained as
a threshold enhancement.

line), and threshold models.

B. Cusp Eﬀects

It is well-known that loop (such as bubble or trian-
gle) diagrams have singularities that can generate sharp
features in relevant processes[30]. Generically, this is im-
portant when the production mechanism does not couple
directly to the ﬁnal state; rather the coupling is via higher
mass intermediate states. This scenario provides a likely
explanation of the Zb and Zc states[5].
In the case of the X(5568) the only nearby two-particle
state is B∗
s π at 5555 MeV. We therefore postulate a
generic production process that gives rise to B∗
s π± and
rescatters into Bsπ. The dynamics is approximated via
nonrelativistic contact interactions with a Gaussian form
factor dominated by a scale of order ΛQCD.

Here µ is the reduced B∗
s π mass and (cid:96) = 1. The scale
β was adjusted to ﬁt the X signal. The denominator in
Eq. 1 accounts for B∗
s π rescattering; we see no
evidence for this and set λ = 0. The result is shown as a
solid line in Fig. 2, where a good ﬁt to the DØ signal is
evident. We remark that the generic features displayed
here will also hold in the case of a production mechanism
that proceeds via a triangle diagram.
In spite of this success, we do not regard it as likely
that rescattering via B∗
s π is a viable explanation of the
DØ signal. Firstly, this mechanism requires rescatter-
ing in P-wave, which is typically too weak to gener-
ate large eﬀects. Furthermore, the scale required to re-
produce the Breit-Wigner of width 22 MeV is β = 50
MeV. This is an order of magnitude smaller than typ-
ical scales in these applications[5]. Finally, the pro-
s π → Bsπ is unusual because it does not entail
cess B∗
ﬂavour exchange, which typically must occur in low en-
ergy hadronic scattering[31, 32]. In fact, it is more nat-
ural to couple the Bsπ system to B ¯K, which would gen-
erate a J P = 0+ cusp slightly above 5770 MeV.

s π cusp mechanism were valid it predicts a
“state” slightly above 5555 MeV (we obtain 5562 MeV)
with the quantum numbers J P = 1−. Furthermore, a
neutral Bsπ0 state should exist at 5557 MeV (or rather
5 MeV below the X) with the same width and shape as
the X. Finally, one might also expect an analogue BsK
state slightly above B∗

s K (5909 MeV).

QCD sum rules are remarkably consistent with experi-
ment
[22–25], while those of quark models [26–28] are
in the right region. The success of these approaches is
surprising because, as we now show, according to simple
arguments the X(5568) appears remarkably light for an
su¯b ¯d tetraquark.

Firstly, note that the bsu baryons Ξb and Ξ∗

b have
masses of 5794 and 5945 MeV. It would be remarkable if
an su¯b ¯d tetraquark, which contains an additional valence
quark, were hundreds of MeV lighter.
Another surprise is the proximity of X(5568) to the
B(∗)
s π thresholds. This does not seem natural given that
the tetraquark does not beneﬁt from the chiral symme-
try which protects the lightness of the pion.
Instead
we would expect the natural mass scale for an su¯b ¯d
tetraquark to be near thresholds for other meson pairs
with the same quark content, such as B(∗) ¯K (∗) (whose
spin-averaged mass is above 6 GeV).

To quantify this statement, we consider the Hamilto-

nian of refs. [26–28],

(cid:88)

C. The Molecular Hypothesis

Candidates for molecular states typically involve me-
son pairs in S-wave with mass somewhat above the ob-
served signal. In this case no viable pairs are available
and one is forced to speculate on a wider scale than nor-
mal. For example, it is possible for the Bsπ system to
scatter into B ¯K via either quark exchange or K∗ ex-
change. If the eﬀective potential that describes this in-
teraction has an attractive region near the origin with a
repulsive region at somewhat larger distances then it is
possible that a resonance of the Gamow-Gurney-Condon
(GGC) type is generated above Bsπ threshold. This sce-
nario thus relies on some unusual S-wave dynamics and
on the shape of the repulsive peak being appropriate to
generating a width of 20 MeV due to tunneling.
We have tested the feasibility of this mechanism by
computing the amplitude for Bsπ → B ¯K scattering (due
to quark exchange) in the nonrelativistic quark model.
Our calculation employed the formalism given in ref. [31],
with results shown in Fig. 3. The main ﬁgure shows
the resulting S-wave scattering amplitude contributions
from the conﬁning (“Cornell”) and hyperﬁne interac-
tions. These are computed in the “prior” and “post” for-
malisms, where the interaction is deﬁned with respect to
the initial or ﬁnal scattering states respectively. The two
approaches should agree in the limit of accurate wave-
functions, hence the good agreement shown indicates a
reasonably robust computation.

The insert shows the equivalent S-wave potential. Sur-
prisingly, this is precisely of the form required to pro-
duce a GGC resonance (the location of the X(5568) is
shown with an arrow). Unfortunately, this potential is
not strong enough to generate the desired resonance. In-
creasing the strength of the potential eventually yields a
bound state below 5507 MeV, which is, of course, not the
desired result.

Because of these observations, we do not regard the
GGC resonance idea as a likely explanation of the X sig-
nal – too many delicate features would have to be realised
for it to be viable.

III. TETRAQUARK SCENARIO

(3)

Due to the diﬃculty in explaining X(5568) as a kine-
matic eﬀect, we now consider the more exotic tetraquark
interpretation. We ﬁnd the X(5568) mass unexpectedly
light for a tetraquark candidate, and show that it should
be accompanied by several very narrow partners with dif-
ferent isospin and spin.

A. Mass

Following the X(5568) discovery (we are not aware of
any predictions) there have been several calculations of
the mass of an su¯b ¯d tetraquark. Mass estimates from

k

ij

where mk is the mass of a constituent quark [27, 28] or
diquark [26], and the coeﬃcient αij, which depends on
the color conﬁguration of the fermion pair ij, is extracted
from experiment and scales inversely with quark masses.
The same formula does a remarkably good job of repro-
ducing the masses and spin splittings of ordinary mesons
and baryons [33–35]. Note that ref. [26], following most
previous diquark models [36–38], include in the second
term interactions between all pairwise combinations of
fermionic constituents. In this case the idea of diquarks
as eﬀective degrees of freedom no longer seems appropri-
ate; we comment further on this below.

tribution varies signiﬁcantly for diﬀerent models, we at-
tempt a rough estimate of the tetraquark mass on the
basis of the ﬁrst term, working with a constituent quark
(rather than diquark) model. We take our parameters
from conventional hadrons, and by inverting equation (3)
obtain the sum of constituent masses in a meson from
the spin-averaged mass (3MV + MP )/4 of the vector (V )
and pseudoscalar (P ) mesons. This gives two indepen-
dent estimates for the sum of the masses of the su¯b ¯d
constituents, considering the combinations (u¯b)(s ¯d) and
(s¯b)(u ¯d),

(3B∗ + B + 3K∗ + K) = 6107 MeV,
(3B∗

s + Bs + 3ρ + π) = 6019 MeV.

(4)

(5)

The ﬁrst of these should be a better estimate of the true
masses, since the lightness of the pion has more to do
with chiral symmetry than the spin-dependent interac-
tions responsible for the splittings of other mesons. For
comparison, the masses of ref.
[39], obtained from av-
eraging over diﬀerent combinations of mesons to those

above, yield a similar result,(cid:88)

mk = 6146 MeV.

(6)

k

These estimates should be considered as lower limits.
Fits to the spectra of baryons rather than mesons yield
larger constituent masses [34, 40, 41] whose sums exceed
those quoted above by hundreds of MeV.

On the basis of these estimates, the X(5568) is much

lighter than would be expected as a tetraquark.

Tetraquark models for other exotic states do not en-
counter the same problem. In particular, since X(3872),
Zc(3900), Zc(4025), Zb(10610) and Zb(10650) are close
to D∗ ¯D(∗) and B∗ ¯B(∗) thresholds, it is automatic that,
in tetraquark models for these states, the spin-averaging
procedure analogous to the above will yield total quark
masses near to the physical masses. The situation for
X(5568) is markedly diﬀerent, suggesting that if it is in-
deed a tetraquark state, it cannot easily be accommo-
dated in the same models applied to these other putative
tetraquarks.

Given the above general arguments, it is surprising
that the estimates of refs. [26–28] are comparable to the
X(5568) mass. We now discuss these estimates in more
detail.

Liu et al.

[27] use the Hamiltonian (3) with quark
(rather than diquark) constituents, with coeﬃcients αij
extracted from meson spectra. They obtain two scalar
su¯b ¯d tetraquarks in the appropriate mass region, one
slightly heavier, and one lighter, than X(5568). The rea-
son for their surprisingly low masses is the chosen con-
stituent quark masses, whose sum is much less than our

estimates above, (cid:88)

k

mk = 5700 MeV.

(7)

4

The masses are taken from their earlier paper [42], in
which the u, d, s and c masses appear to have been cho-
sen to reproduce the mass of DsJ (2632) in a tetraquark
model, and the b mass is in turn estimated from the c
mass. As a check on these values we use them to es-
timate the masses of some conventional hadrons with
similar quark content, and ﬁnd that they lead to dras-
tic under-estimates, for example predicting 5250 MeV
for the centre of mass of buu baryons (compared to the
experimental values Λb = 5620 MeV, Σb = 5811 MeV,
Σ∗
b = 5832 MeV), 5390 MeV for bsu baryons (Ξb =
5794 MeV, Ξ∗
b = 5945 MeV), 4940 MeV for b ¯d mesons
(B = 5280 MeV, B∗ = 5325 MeV), 5080 MeV for
b¯s mesons (Bs = 5367 MeV, B∗
s = 5415 MeV). Note
that tetraquark models for other states do not encounter
this problem; applying the same Hamiltonian to the Zc
states [39], one of the authors of ref. [27] used the quark
masses who sum is quoted in (6) above.

Wang and Zhu [26] use the Hamiltonian (3) but with
diquark constituents, and with coeﬃcients αij taken from
previous literature on tetraquarks. Their scalar su¯b ¯d
tetraquark has mass 5708 MeV, somewhat too heavy
for X(5568), but not too far oﬀ. The comparatively
low value is primarily due to the chosen diquark masses
which, as with the quark masses of ref.
[27], are cho-
sen not with reference to conventional hadrons, but from
other tetraquark models. The bd mass of 5249 MeV is ob-
tained by ﬁtting Yb(10980) as a P-wave tetraquark [43]
(see also [38]), and the us mass of 590 MeV is from a
tetraquark ﬁt for a0(980) [36]. These diquark masses
are considerably lighter than those obtained in other ap-
proaches based on conventional baryons. In the model
of Ebert et al. the (spin-averaged) masses of bd and us
diquarks are 5376 MeV and 1039 MeV [44, 45]. (See also
ref. [46] for a comparison with other approaches, which
give similar values.)

Stancu [28] employs the Hamiltonian (3) with quark
constituents, and the mass obtained is in good agreement
with experiment. Unlike in refs [26, 27], the low mass is
not due to the constituent masses, whose sum is not much
less than the lower bounds estimated above,

mk = 6090 MeV,

(8)

k

but is instead due to large spin splitting of −552 MeV.
By comparison, the lightest su¯b ¯d tetraquarks in the
other approaches experience splittings −131 MeV [26]
and −225 MeV [27]. Some enhancement in the splitting
is to be expected, since ref. [28] includes all color combi-
nations (unlike ref. [26]) and allows for full mixing across
the basis states is allowed (unlike ref. [27]). However the
more signiﬁcant eﬀect is the choice of coeﬃcients αij in
the spin-dependent term.

In particular, for the u ¯d interaction (which is the dom-
inant contribution to the su¯b ¯d splitting) the coeﬃcient
is chosen to reproduce the ρ − π mass diﬀerence. As
remarked earlier, the lightness of the pion is not solely
due to the spin-dependent interactions which control the

(cid:88)

spectra of other hadrons, so this value is likely to be
an overestimate. To avoid this problem, other authors
choose to extract coeﬃcients from baryons, rather than
mesons, leading to smaller values.

To check the sensitivity of the results of ref.

[28], we
have reproduced the calculation with diﬀerent parame-
ter sets. Replacing the coeﬃcients for su, s ¯d and u ¯d
interactions with those of ref. [47], the splitting reduces
to −401 MeV, pushing the total mass up to 5689 MeV.
(Remember that the chosen quark masses are already
somewhat lighter than the lower bounds quoted above.)
Going to the heavy quark limit (switching oﬀ any pair-
wise interactions with b) we ﬁnd −357 MeV, consistent
with the previously quoted result for the su ¯d combina-
tion [48]. Alternatively, using the full parameter set of
ref. [27], we obtain −355 MeV.

To summarise, among the various approaches that of
ref.
[28] seems most promising, but we ﬁnd that it can
only reproduce the X(5568) mass with a choice of low
quark masses and large spin coupling coeﬃcients.

B. Neutral partners

Setting aside the apparent diﬃculty of its mass, we
now explore some implications of the tetraquark inter-
pretation for X(5568). Foremost among these is the ex-
istence of several narrow partner states. We restrict our
discussion to states with ﬂavour sq¯b¯q (where q is u or d).
A proliferation of partner states with ﬂavours qq¯b¯q and
ss¯b¯s is also expected and will not be discussed here; see
refs. [27, 49].
As a tetraquark the |I, I3(cid:105) = |1,±1(cid:105) state X(5568)
would have two neutral partners nearby, either isospin
eigenstates |1, 0(cid:105) and |0, 0(cid:105), or linear combinations
thereof. This distinguishes it from the cusp scenario,
which has only one neutral state. (A third neutral state
is possible due to ss¯b¯s, but we do not discuss this; most
of the conclusions below are not aﬀected.)
If isospin is a good quantum number, the |1, 0(cid:105) state
decaying into Bsπ0 would be degenerate with X(5568),
unlike in the cusp scenario in which the Bsπ0 peak would
be a few MeV lower in mass than the Bsπ± peak. A
more drastic consequence is that the |0, 0(cid:105) state would
be remarkably narrow, as it has no open strong decay
channels: the lowest relevant isoscalar threshold is B ¯K,
more than 200 MeV heavier. The isoscalar counterpart
to X(5568) could only decay (into B(∗)
s π) by isospin vio-
lation, radiatively, or weakly. Such a narrow state would
be a striking signature for tetraquarks: as there are no
isoscalar thresholds nearby, kinematic eﬀects are unlikely
to be relevant.
If instead the physical states are admixtures of |1, 0(cid:105)
and |0, 0(cid:105), mixing would drive their masses apart com-
pared to the unmixed masses, so that one is heavier,
and the other lighter, than the observed |1,±1(cid:105) state
X(5568). Their strong decays proceed via their isovector
components, which are suppressed by mixing angles, so

5

the states would be narrower than X(5568) before small
phase space diﬀerences.

Experimental analysis of the Bsπ0 channel would
therefore be revealing. A peak at the mass of X(5568)
would indicate the possibility of tetraquark degrees of
freedom (since a peak due to a cusp would be lower), and
since this implies a state of pure isospin, there would have
to be an extremely narrow partner state in the same mass
region, which may or may not also be visible in Bsπ0. Al-
ternatively, the observation of a pair of peaks, narrower
and displaced either side of the X(5568) mass, would also
indicate tetraquarks, in this case of mixed isospin.

C. Other partners

A tetraquark X(5568) would also have other partners
(both isovector and isoscalar) with various spin quan-
tum numbers. The proliferation of partners is a generic
feature of tetraquark models, and in some cases the ex-
perimental absence of partners can be understood as a
result of their being so broad as to be eﬀectively unob-
servable [50, 51]. We will see that this does not apply to
the partners of X(5568).

Assuming S-wave constituents, for each ﬂavour there
are two scalars (0+), three axials (1+) and a single ten-
sor (2+). In the most general models, the multiplicity of
states doubles again, due to the two color combinations
(qq)3(¯b¯q)3 and (qq)6(¯b¯q)6. Diquark models typically ig-
nore the second combination, thus halving the total num-
ber of states, although this may not be justiﬁed [52, 53].
Of the models applied to X(5568), ref. [26] belongs to
this second class of models with a truncated spectrum,
whereas refs [27, 28] include all color combinations and
so predict twice as many states. For our discussion we
refer to the truncated spectrum, although many of our
conclusions are easily generalised to the full spectrum.

Since αij in equation (3) scales inversely with quark
mass, the spectrum of qq¯b¯q tetraquarks is largely (or
completely, in the heavy quark limit) determined by the
spins of the light quarks qq ¯q [27, 48]. There are three
doublets, characterised by the spins s and S of qq and
qq ¯q. The lowest doublets (with s = 0, S = 1/2 and
s = 1, S = 1/2) each contain 0+ and 1+ states, while
the highest (s = 1, S = 3/2) has 1+ and 2+. The spec-
trum is depicted in the left panel of Fig. 4.

The above considerations explain the spectrum in the
diquark model of ref. [26], where the three doublets can
be clearly seen. To characterise this as a diquark model
does not seem appropriate, since the Hamiltonian is (ap-
proximately) diagonal in the basis where the spins of the
light quarks qq ¯q, not the spins of diquarks qq and ¯b¯q,
are good quantum numbers. Similar remarks apply to
diquark models in other contexts, such as Qq ¯Q¯q, where
the spectrum is largely determined by the spin of q ¯q,
rather than the spins of the diquarks Qq and ¯Q¯q.

A diﬀerent implementation of the diquark idea con-
siders in equation (3) only spin interactions within a

combinations as the most general models. The left plot shows the spectrum in models (such as ref. [26]) with pairwise spin-spin
interactions among all quark constituents; the ordering of the doublets (characterised by the spin of the light quarks qq ¯q) is

models with spin-spin interactions only within diquarks; the gap separating the lighter 0+ and 1+ is the same as that separating
the two heavier 1+ states, and the highest lying 0+, 1+ and 2+ are degenerate.

diquark, ignoring those between quarks in diﬀerent di-
quarks [54]. This is more consistent with the idea of
diquarks as eﬀective degrees of freedom, since it is equiv-
alent to

(cid:88)

H =

where now mk are the masses of the constituent diquarks
after spin splitting, with the axial somewhat heavier than
the scalar. The mass diﬀerence between the scalar (S)
and axial (A) diquark qq should be considerably larger
than that of the scalar ( ¯S) and axial ( ¯A) antidiquarks ¯b¯q.
Hence there is a small separation between the lightest
states 0+ (S ¯S) and 1+ (S ¯A), a larger separation to the
next 1+ state (A ¯S), and higher still a degenerate triplet
0+, 1+, 2+ (A ¯A). The spectrum in this approach is sum-
marised in the right panel of Fig. 4.

As shown in Fig. 4, there are characteristic diﬀerences
in the mass spectra of tetraquark models depending on
whether or not diquarks are genuine eﬀective degrees of
freedom. If partners to X(5568) are eventually discov-
ered, the pattern of their masses can be used to constrain
models.

In both approaches, as in the other class of models
which include all color combinations and have twice as
many states in the spectrum, the lightest states are an
approximately degenerate 0+/1+ pair. If X(5568) is to
be identiﬁed with one or the other of these states, it must
therefore have a nearly degenerate partner with diﬀerent
spin. If X(5568) is itself an I(J P ) = 1(0+) state (decay-
ing to Bsπ), it must have a 1(1+) partner nearby (de-
caying to B∗
s π with less phase space, hence narrow). Al-
ternatively if X(5568) is a 1(1+) state (decaying to B∗
s π
with a hidden photon) it would have a 1(0+) partner (de-
caying to Bsπ). Note also that in either interpretation
a further pair of degenerate isoscalar partners 0(0+) and
0(1+) is expected, both very narrow as they are stable to

strong decays. (Alternatively the neutral partners could
mix with the isovectors as described in the previous sec-
tion.)

In order to discuss the higher-lying states we need
an estimate of spin splittings, which vary from model
to model. We base our discussion on the splittings of
ref. [26], and comment on the other models below.
In
their approach the separation between the heaviest and
lightest su¯b ¯d tetraquarks is 235 MeV. Re-scaling their
masses to identify the lightest as X(5568), the heaviest
partners would have masses around 5800 MeV. In this
case very few strong decay channels are available to the
tetraquark family: only Bsπ, B∗
s π, and possibly, for the
heaviest of the states, B(∗) ¯K are kinematically accessi-
ble. Note that we expect a smaller overall splitting in
models where spin interactions are restricted to within,
rather than between, diquarks, namely for spectra of the
type depicted in the right panel of Fig. 4. In this case it
is likely that all states are below B ¯K threshold.

Since the B(∗)

s π channels are accessible only to isovec-
tors, we can conclude that most, if not all, of the isoscalar
tetraquarks are stable to strong decay. Only those above
B(∗) ¯K threshold can decay strongly. This seems unlikely
for the 0(0+) state, which lies at the top of the spec-
trum only in the genuine diquark model, where smaller
In order for the 0(1+)
splittings overall are expected.
to decay it would have to be above the heavier B∗ ¯K
threshold, requiring a stronger splitting than ref.
[26].
The 0(2+) couples to B(∗) ¯K, but only in D-wave, and
with non-conservation of quark spin; we thus expect that
it, too, would be very narrow.

In general the isovector states have more possibilities.
The heavier among the 1(0+) and 1(1+) states can decay
to Bsπ and B∗
s π respectively, but with more phase space
than X(5568) and its degenerate partner, so presumably
they will be broader.
If suﬃciently heavy they could
also decay to B ¯K and B∗ ¯K. The 1(2+) would decay to

0(cid:43)1(cid:43)2(cid:43)Mass0(cid:43)1(cid:43)2(cid:43)MassB(∗)
s π, and possibly B(∗) ¯K, but only in D-wave and with
non-conservation of quark spin, as described above.

The spectra of refs [27, 28] contain twice as many
states. The heavier among these can access several strong
decay channels, but many remain below B ¯K threshold,
and so will be narrow for the reasons described above.

Tetraquark interpretations can occasionally be applied
to a particular state without invoking a proliferation of
partners. This only works if, due to the pattern of strong
decay channels, the candidate itself is uniquely stable. In
the case of X(5568) the scenario is very diﬀerent. Among
the many partners with various spin and isospin, it is
one of comparatively few which can decay strongly. The
rest would be extremely narrow, and their discovery in
weak or radiative decays would support the tetraquark
hypothesis.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have examined a number of possible explanations
of the X(5568) signal and ﬁnd that none of them give
a satisfactory description of the observed state. In par-
ticular, the location and shape of the line shape make
a threshold explanation unlikely. Cusp models rely on
nearby hadronic hadronic channels – the only available
channel is B∗
s π. This gets the mass correct and pre-
dicts the quantum numbers of the X as J P = 1−. How-
ever, this explanation requires P-wave rescattering with a
ﬂavour-blind interaction. Both of these are not preferred
in conventional phenomenology. If the cusp explanation
ﬁnds support, then a series of similar “states” are ex-
pected. For example, a neutral cusp should appear in
Bsπ0 approximately 5 MeV below the X. Similar cusps
would also be expected in BsK near B∗
s K and in Bπ
near B∗π.

Possible molecular explanations are necessarily similar
to cusp models since both rely on nearby hadronic thresh-
olds. The only reasonable channel is B ¯K but this either
requires a binding of more than 200 MeV and a weak
coupling to Bsπ or a coupled Bsπ− B ¯K system with un-
usual GGC interactions. Neither of these scenarios are
likely.

The failure of plausible weak coupling scenarios en-
courages speculation based on strong coupling tetraquark
models. Unfortunately, these appear to suﬀer similar
problems; namely all natural estimates (by which we
mean those with mass predictions tuned to well-known

7

hadronic resonances) yield masses that are 500 MeV or
higher than the X mass. If one ignores this basic prob-
lem, then tetraquark models predict a pair of nearby neu-
tral X states that should be visible in Bsπ. In fact, many
spin and ﬂavour analogue states are expected. A novel
feature of many of these is that they will be very long
lived, and therefore should be readily seen in appropri-
ate channels.
If such states are observed it will likely
revolutionise the current understanding of strongly cou-
pled QCD phenomenology.

Given the diﬃculty in constructing a viable resonance
or weak coupling model of the X, it is prudent in en-
quire into the robustness of the experimental signal. An
immediate concern is that the background peaks under
the resonance, and this is enhanced by the “cone cut”
employed by DØ. Indeed, approximately one half of the
signal events can easily be absorbed into a slight adjust-
ment of the background shape, signiﬁcantly reducing the
signiﬁcance of the observation. Thus it is important that
this shape be accurately obtained in the sidebands.

A more elaborate possible confounding issue involves
missing hadrons. The DØ detector cannot detect pi-
ons at low transverse momentum. This raises the pos-
sibility that the Bsπ system is actually produced in an
electroweak decay (of, say, the Bc) with an undetected
hadron. Integrating events over the unknown degrees of
freedom can yield a peak in the Bsπ system with a typ-
ical hadronic width. For example, Bc → Bsρ → Bsπ[π]
naturally gives rise to a kink in the Bsπ spectrum near
5570 MeV. If this peak were to be ameliorated at higher
invariant mass (due to hadronic form factors) then it is
possible to generate a signal similar to that of the X.
Testing this scenario will require careful simulation ac-
counting for detector eﬃciencies and hadronic form fac-
tors.

In summary, no viable explanation of the X(5568) is
apparent. While we are aware of the dangers of making
a “failure of imagination” argument, this suggests that
extensive follow-up experimentation is in order, both to
verify the original signal and to search for the many pos-
sible adjunct states.
