Any N = 2 superconformal ﬁeld theory (SCFT) in four dimensions has a sector of operators
related to a two-dimensional chiral algebra containing a Virasoro sub-algebra. Moreover,

there are well-known examples of isolated SCFTs whose chiral algebra is a Virasoro algebra.
In this note, we consider the chiral algebras associated with interacting N = 2 SCFTs
possessing an exactly marginal deformation that can be interpreted as a gauge coupling

(i.e., at special points on the resulting conformal manifolds, free gauge ﬁelds appear that

decouple from isolated SCFT building blocks). At any point on these conformal manifolds,

we argue that the associated chiral algebras possess at least three generators. In addition,

we show that there are examples of SCFTs realizing such a minimal chiral algebra: they

are certain points on the conformal manifold obtained by considering the low-energy limit
of type IIB string theory on the three complex-dimensional hypersurface singularity x3

theories can be conformally gauged only if there is a SUSY moduli space associated with
the corresponding symmetry current moment maps in each sector, and (ii) N = 2 SCFTs
with a ≥ c have hidden fermionic symmetries (in the sense of fermionic chiral algebra

N = 2 SCFTs in four dimensions have at least two natural sub-sectors: the N = 2 chiral
ring (i.e., the ring of operators annihilated by all the anti-chiral Poincar´e supersymmetries)

and the sector of Schur operators. The former controls the Coulomb branch moduli space

of vacua (when it exists) and was elucidated over twenty years ago in the groundbreaking

work of Seiberg and Witten [1]. The later captures a more intricate structure that is

related to a chiral algebra in two dimensions [2]. When there is a Higgs branch, the Schur

operators describe its properties, but this sector is also much more general.

Surprisingly, recent work on Argyres-Douglas theories [3–8] shows that these two sectors

are in fact closely related.

Indeed, aspects of the Coulomb branch operator spectrum

are secretly encoded in the Schur limit of the superconformal index [4]. Moreover, BPS

calculations on the Coulomb branch allow one to reproduce the Schur index [6–8].

In this work, we will show another way in which the N = 2 chiral ring is tied to the
Schur sector. More precisely, we focus on the subset of the N = 2 chiral ring that controls
exactly marginal deformations (i.e., the chiral operators of scaling dimension two). We will

argue below that if a theory has an exactly marginal deformation, and it can be interpreted

as a gauge coupling (i.e., the conformal manifold is built by conformally gauging global

1

symmetries of isolated SCFT sub-sectors), then the chiral algebra, χ, associated with the

theory has at least three generators. We will write this statement as

|χ| ≥ 3 ,

(1.1)

where the norm indicates the number of generators of the chiral algebra (i.e., the number

of operators whose normal-ordered products, along with their derivatives, span the chiral

algebra).

Interestingly, it turns out that the bound in (1.1) can be saturated by actual theories.
Indeed, we ﬁnd one such example: the A(6) theory of Feigin, Feigin, and Tipunin [9], and
the associated four-dimensional theory is gotten by, for example, studying the low-energy

limit of type IIB string theory on a particular three complex-dimensional hypersurface

singularity we will mention below. Alternatively, this theory can be engineered by taking
three copies of the (A1, A3) theory and gauging a diagonal SU(2).

In the context of certain isolated theories, like the (A1, A2n) theories [10], it is known
that the chiral algebra corresponds to a vacuum module of Virasoro [6, 11], so |χ| = 1.
Our result is a ﬁrst hint of some new connections between conformal manifolds and chiral

algebras. We will brieﬂy return to these points in the conclusions.

We should also note that our argument in favor of (1.1) has at least two interesting

spinoﬀs:

(i) We show that we can conformally gauge some diagonal global symmetry, H, of a
set of isolated theories, Ti, only if the corresponding holomorphic moment maps, µI
i(cid:1)n 6= 0 in the chiral ring of the Ti
(with I = 1,· · · ,|H| an adjoint index), satisfy (cid:0)µI
for all n > 0. A standard folk theorem (which we do not prove) then implies that
there is an associated SUSY moduli space in each Ti.

i

(ii) Assuming all N = 2 SCFTs (or at least the ones we study) have the asymptotic
Cardy-like behavior governed by a − c derived in [12], then it follows that for any
N = 2 theory with a ≥ c, the associated chiral algebra necessarily has fermionic
generators.1 This result implies that |χ| ≥ 3 for interacting theories with a ≥ c.

1In [3], we saw that a − c does indeed control the q → 1 asymptotics of the Schur index for collections
of free hypermultiplets and vector multiplets as well as for several inﬁnite classes of non-Lagrangian theories

(see also the recent discussion in [13]) via

lim
β→0

log IS(q) = −

8π2
β

(a − c) + ··· .

(1.2)

In this formula, IS(q) is the Schur index, and q = e−β is the corresponding superconformal fugacity (see

2

The ﬁrst point indicates a surprising connection between two diﬀerent spaces: the con-

formal manifold on the one hand and the moduli space of vacua on the other (in all known

examples, there is a more obvious connection between the conformal manifold and the

Coulomb branch, because the exactly marginal deformations sit in multiplets whose pri-
maries parameterize part of the Coulomb branch).2 The second point is interesting as well
since it implies that N = 2 theories with a ≥ c have, in some sense, additional fermionic
symmetries. In the case of theories with N > 2 (which necessarily have a = c), these addi-
tional symmetries include additional supersymmetries in four space-time dimensions (and

therefore additional supersymmetries in two-dimensions—see [14] for a recent discussion of
the case with 4D N = 3 and [2] for the case with 4D N = 4). On the other hand, in the
case of theories with only N = 2 SUSY, these additional fermionic symmetries only exist
at the level of the corresponding chiral algebras.

The plan of this paper is as follows. In the next section, we review some chiral algebra

and Schur sector basics. We then describe conformal gauging and what it means for the

Schur sector. Afterwards, we move on to describe some empirical evidence in favor of (1.1).

Section 4 is the meat of the paper and contains our physics proof of (1.1).

In section

5, we then describe our realization of a theory that saturates (1.1). Finally, we end with

conclusions and a discussion of open problems.

2. Chiral algebra / Schur sector basics

In this section we will give a lightning review of the pertinent aspects of Schur operators [15]

and their associated chiral algebras [2] that are useful below. For further details, the reader

is encouraged to consult the original references.

The Schur sector consists of the operators that are annihilated by the two supercharges
− (along with their conjugates). These degrees of freedom are the operators

˜Q2 ˙− and Q1
that contribute to the Schur limit of the superconformal index

I(q; ~x) = TrH(−1)F e−β∆qE−RYi

(xi)fi .

(2.1)

the discussion in section 2 for further details). On the other hand, for certain N = 1 theories, [13] argues
that the Cardy-like behavior of [12] is modiﬁed. We assume that the theories we study have the standard
Cardy-like behavior controlled by a − c in (1.2) (and we are not aware of any N = 2 SCFT counterexamples
to this behavior).

2Connections between conformal manifolds and moduli spaces of vacua arise often in the context of the

AdS/CFT correspondence. However, the relations we ﬁnd are purely in the realm of ﬁeld theory.

3

Here |q| < 1, the |xi| = 1 are ﬂavor symmetry fugacities, E is the scaling dimension, R is
the SU(2)R Cartan, and ∆ = (cid:8)Q2 ˙−, (Q2 ˙−)†(cid:9). In the classiﬁcation of [16], the multiplets

that contain Schur operators are of type (see also the original discussion in [17])

ˆBR , DR(0,j2) ⊕ ¯DR(j1,0) ,

ˆCR(j1,j2) ,

(2.2)

where the ji are the Lorentz spins.

It turns out that the ˆBR and ¯DR(j1,0) form a subring called the Hall-Littlewood (HL)
chiral ring, and it will be important for us below. As a point of reference, the ˆBR multiplets
contain Schur operators that are the highest-weight primaries and parameterize the Higgs
branch (when it exists). In particular, ˆB1 is the multiplet corresponding to ﬂavor symmetry
currents, and the Schur operator is the holomorphic moment map, µ. On the other hand,
the DR(0,j2)⊕ ¯DR(j1,0) multiplets contain, respectively, ﬁrst level ˜Q2 ˙+ and Q1
+ highest-weight
descendants as Schur operators. When R = j1 = j2 = 0, these multiplets are vector
+, ˜λ2 ˙+. The ˆCR(j1,j2) are
multiplets, and the corresponding Schur operators are gauginos, λ1
semi-short multiplets and contain Schur operators as ˜Q2 ˙+Q1
+ highest-weight descendants.
The ˆC0(0,0) multiplet is the stress tensor multiplet, and the corresponding Schur operator is
the highest weight state of the SU(2)R current, J 11
+ ˙+ (where the superscripts are SU(2)R
spinor indices).

The authors of a beautiful recent paper [2] found a deep connection between the above

Schur operators and two-dimensional chiral algebras. Roughly speaking, one ﬁxes the Schur

operators to lie in a plane and works with respect to a cohomology deﬁned by a partic-

ular nilpotent supercharge. The Schur operators form non-trivial representatives of this

cohomology. Moreover, the Schur operators behave meromorphically (i.e., their correlation

functions in the plane are meromorphic) as long as we twist the anti-holomorphic transla-
tions in the plane with the SU(2)R symmetry. Therefore, twisted-translated cohomology
classes corresponding to Schur operators map to chiral algebra operators.

As an illustration of the above discussion, we have the following natural 4d/2d maps [2]

χ(cid:2)J 11

χ(cid:2)µI(cid:3) =

where χ[· · · ] denotes the chiral algebra image of the argument, T is the holomorphic stress
tensor, J I is an aﬃne current, and ∂ is a holomorphic derivative. Moreover, the central
charges in four dimensions map simply to corresponding charges in two dimensions: c2d =
−12c4d and k2d = − 1

2 k4d. In addition, the holomorphic level, h, satisﬁes

h = E − R .

4

(2.4)

We can write the torus partition function of the chiral algebra as follows

Z(x, q) = Tr xM ⊥

qL0 ,

(2.5)

where h is the eigenvalue of L0, and the trace is taken over the chiral algebra states.
In (2.5), x is a fugacity for the rotations in the plane transverse to the chiral algebra

plane. From the perspective of the chiral algebra, this is an additional symmetry, and it
will play an important role in our example below. Setting x = −1 and using the fact
that spin-statistics implies that (−1)M ⊥
= (−1)F , where F is the fermion number, it is
straightforward to argue that the torus partition function should match the Schur index in

(2.1)

Z(−1, q) = I(q) .

(2.6)

We will use this correspondence below to identify the A(6) theory with the chiral algebra
of our diagonally gauged AD theory.

The important points of the above chiral algebra story for us are the following

• From (2.3), we see that the two-dimensional chiral algebra always has a Virasoro sub
algebra since there is always an SU(2)R current in four dimensions. In the next few
sections, we will see what additional structure the conformal manifold forces on this

algebra.

• The generators of the HL ring are automatically chiral algebra generators [2].
• If the four-dimensional theory has ﬂavor symmetry moment maps that vanish (in
the chiral ring) at second order in the singlet channel, then T in (2.3) is not an

independent generator. Instead, it is the Sugawara stress tensor.

• Higgs branch generators contribute at least two chiral algebra generators since the
Higgs branch is quaternionic. Moreover,
interacting theories with Higgs branches
necessarily have |χ| ≥ 3 since the stress tensor typically contributes an additional
generator. In order for the stress tensor to be a Sugawara composite in two dimen-
sions, there must be at least three ˆBR generators (and a corresponding number of
generators in two dimensions) [2].

• The previous point also applies to ˆBR generators whose vevs parameterize more gen-
eral moduli spaces where SU(2)R is broken but U(1)R is preserved. For example,
these moduli spaces can contain some number of free vector multiplets in addition to

free hypermultiplets at generic points.

2.1. Gauging

In this section we suppose that we start with a collection of N isolated SCFTs and gauge

a diagonal H symmetry with coupling g

δW = g · Φ

µi ,

N

Xi=1

(2.7)

where Φ is the adjoint ﬁeld, and the µi are the H moment maps of the diﬀerent isolated
sectors, Ti. We then want to know what happens to the chiral algebra.

In very general terms, when we turn on a non-zero gauge coupling, many of the mul-

tiplets that were short at g = 0 pair up and become long multiplets (according to the

rules of [16]). As a result, the chiral algebra that appears at inﬁnite Zamolodchikov dis-

tance when g = 0 typically becomes much smaller when we are at ﬁnite Zamolodchikov

distance and non-zero gauge coupling. For operators built out of the Schur gauginos and
moment maps, this pairing up can be explicitly worked out at small gauge coupling3 via
the following (anti)commutators

−, λ1

n ˜Q2 ˙−, ˜λ2 ˙+o = (cid:8)Q1

−, ˜λ2 ˙+o = 0 ,
−, D+ ˙+(cid:3) = g˜λ1
(cid:2)Q1

˙+ = g˜λ2 ˙+ ,

(2.8)

The last two commutators amount to imposing current conservation. Most of the operators

built out of these degrees of freedom pair up at non-zero gauge coupling.

The important points for us below are that

• Interacting theories with fermionic chiral algebra generators must have |χ| ≥ 3 since

these operators come in pairs and cannot form a stress tensor composite.

• We do not require that the chiral algebra is invariant as we explore ﬁnite diameter
subregions of the conformal manifold (although there is considerable evidence that in

many theories this invariance holds).

3Note that this regime does not require the isolated SCFTs to be weakly coupled.

Indeed, the most

interesting examples to study (including the one we will discuss in more detail below) involve strongly
coupled isolated sectors.

6

3. Phenomenology

Before we get to our argument in favor of |χ| ≥ 3 in the case of theories with a marginal
gauge coupling, let us review some of the strong phenomenological and empirical evidence

in favor of this proposition.

For example, SU(Nc) SQCD with Nf = 2Nc ≥ 4 has at least U(2Nc) ﬂavor symmetry.
Therefore, the associated chiral algebra at any point in the coupling space must have at
c ≥ 16 generators.4 Similar statements hold in the case of superconformal SQCD
least 4N 2
with SO and Sp gauge groups.

Moving to the more general class S context with regular punctures, we can typically
reduce the ﬂavor symmetry,5 and, in the process, induce exactly marginal deformations by
going to higher genus Riemann surfaces. On the other hand, quite generally, higher genus
surfaces lead to theories with D⊕ ¯D representations [15]. As discussed above, this situation
leads to theories with |χ| ≥ 3. For example, the authors of [2] studied the chiral algebra
associated with a genus two SU(2)3 gauge theory. The ﬂavor symmetry is reduced to U(1),
but there are many D ⊕ ¯D representations, and the chiral algebra has |χ| > 3.

Finally, let us consider the class of (generalized) Argyres-Douglas theories. Although

this is an enormous zoo, we can say some things about the associated chiral algebras. For
simplicity, let us stick to the set of (AK−1, AN −1) theories [10]. Such theories have marginal
couplings only if K and N are not relatively prime.6 These theories have (often large) Higgs
branches.
Indeed, the three-dimensional mirror analysis of [18] shows that such theories
have a 2(K − 1) ≥ 2 complex dimensional Higgs branch. It follows from one of our bullet
points in the ﬁrst part of section 2 that |χ| ≥ 3. As a particular set of examples of such
theories with a marginal coupling, we can consider the (AN , AN ) theories for N ≥ 3 (the
conformal manifold of the N = 3 case was explored in [19, 20]). By our above discussion,
|χ| > 2N ≥ 6.

4In the simplest case of SU (2) with Nf = 4, the global symmetry group is enhanced to SO(8), and
the authors of [2] have conjectured that the chiral algebra away from decoupling points is the so(8) Aﬃne
Kac-Moody algebra at level k2d = −2. For Nc > 2, the authors conjecture that the chiral algebra is generated
by aﬃne u(2Nc) currents at level k2d = −Nc along with baryonic generators b and ˜b obeying a particular
OPE.

5Since ﬂavor symmetries must contribute generators to the chiral algebra, reducing the ﬂavor symmetry

can lead to smaller |χ|.

6Note that this is not a biconditional statement. For example, the (A1, A2n−3) theories discussed in [3–5]

are isolated.

7

4. An argument in favor of |χ| ≥ 3
Below we give a detailed argument explaining why the inequality in (1.1) should be satisﬁed

in theories with an exactly marginal gauge coupling.

4.1. The case of N ≥ 4
When the conformal manifold has regions in which N ≥ 4 isolated SCFTs, Ti (i = 1,· · · , N),
weakly coupled to a gauge ﬁeld appear (we denote g = 0 as a strict decoupling point), it is
straightforward to see that |χ| ≥ 3 by a direct argument in superconformal representation
Indeed, consider the Schur conformal primary operators at O(q2). On general
theory.
grounds, these operators must be in multiplets of type ˆC0(0,0), ˆB2, D0(0,1) ⊕ ¯D0(1,0), D1(0,0) ⊕
¯D1(0,0), or D 1

For the purposes of our argument, it suﬃces to focus on the ˆC0(0,0), ˆB2, and D1(0,0) ⊕
¯D1(0,0) multiplets. These degrees of freedom can only recombine into long multiplets via [16]

Clearly, the N(N − 1)/2 ﬂavor-singlet operators Oab = µI
multiplets when g = 0 (here I = 1,· · · ,|H| is an adjoint index). By (4.1), these multiplets
can only recombine if there are an equal number of (ﬂavor-singlet) ˆC0(0,0) multiplets. These
latter multiplets contain a stress tensor, and there are N such multiplets available to pair
up with the Oab multiplets when we turn the gauge coupling on. As a result, there are
N(N − 3)/2 ≥ 2 unpaired Oab multiplets. In particular, it follows that |χ| ≥ 3 as promised.
Note that this is a strict lower bound at any point on the conformal manifold since these

multiplets can disappear from the short sector only by pairing up with new conserved
stress tensor multiplets (which come with an equal number of short ˆB2 and D1(0,0) ⊕ ¯D1(0,0)
multiplets).

Before we conclude this sub-section, let us discuss some subtleties related to free ﬁelds.

To that end, we suppose, as part of our collection of isolated theories at g = 0, we have
free hypermultiplets transforming in n1 ≥ 1 copies of a representation, R1, of H. In this
case, we deﬁne the collection of n1 copies of R1 to form a single isolated sector, T1. The
reason we do not count each of the n1 copies of R1 as forming diﬀerent sectors is that the
corresponding ﬂavor singlet ˆC0(0,0) multiplet used in our argument above involves multiplets
in all n1 copies of R1.

To understand this statement, consider H = SU(2) SCQD with Nf = 4. We have eight
a , and an SO(8) ﬂavor symmetry (here A = 1, 2 is an

fundamental SU(2) doublets, QAi

8

SU(2)R index, a = 1, 2 is a fundamental H gauge index, and i = 1,· · · , 8 is a fundamental
SO(8) index). This theory has thirty-seven short ˆC0(0,0) multiplets at g = 0

Jλ ∼ (λ1

+)I(˜λ2 ˙+)I ,

J ij ∼ ǫABǫabQAi

.

(4.2)

The only ﬂavor singlet ˆC0(0,0) operator arising from the hypermultiplet sector is Jm =
P8
i=1 J ii, and so it is sensible to deﬁne the collection of n1 copies of R1 as a single sector.
Note that when we turn on g 6= 0, the only remaining short operator in this collection

is

(4.3)
The other thirty-six short ˆC0(0,0) multiplets pair up with an equal number of ˆB2 multiplets.
In particular, consider the ﬂavor singlet operator

J = Jλ − Jm .

J⊥ = κλJλ + Jm ,

(4.4)

where κλ 6= 0 is a constant chosen so that hJ⊥(x)J(0)i = 0 at g = 0. This operator pairs
up with the ﬂavor singlet µijµij operator to form a long multiplet, where

µij = ǫabQ1i

a Q1j

b

.

When we turn on small g 6= 0, this statement implies

µijµij = 0 ,

at the level of the chiral ring, while, at the level of the µij(x)µij(0) OPE, we have

µij(x)µij(0) = C · x∆−4 · (Q1)2( ˜Q2)2J⊥ + · · · ,

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

where ∆ > 4. In particular, the term appearing on the RHS of (4.7) arises because µijµij
pairs up with J⊥.

4.2. The case of N = 1

The above argument does not work when the g = 0 point consists of a decoupled gauge
multiplet and a single isolated SCFT sector, T . Instead, we will take a more indirect route
in this case. To that end, we ﬁrst show that T has a moduli (sub)space parameterized
by vevs of the holomorphic moment maps. From this fact, we will be able to show that
if |χ| < 3, then a4d ≥ c4d (note that we add the subscript “4d” to a solely for unity of
notation) along the conformal manifold of the gauged theory. Next, assuming the behavior

9

described in [12] and (1.2) (see the introduction for a discussion of this point), we see that

the partition function of the resulting chiral algebra lacks an essential singularity in the
q → 1 limit. Finally, we argue that the absence of this singularity implies the existence of
fermionic chiral algebra generators and hence, by one of the bullet points in section 2.1,
|χ| ≥ 3.

We begin by proving that in T , the On = (µIµI)n ∈ ˆB2n operators transform in short
multiplets for all n > 0. In other words, we prove that On 6= 0 in the chiral ring of T . For
n = 1, this follows from the unitarity bound of [2]. Indeed, if it were not the case, then

(4.16) of [2] implies

dimH

c4d

=

24h∨
k4d − 12 = −6 ,

(4.8)

and so c4d < 0, which contradicts four-dimensional unitarity. Let us therefore suppose that
there is some maximal ˆn > 1 such that O ˆn−1 is in a short multiplet of T . As a result, O ˆn
is in a long multiplet of type7

ˆC2ˆn−2(0,0) ⊕ D2ˆn−1(0,0) ⊕ ¯D2ˆn−1(0,0) ⊕ ˆB2ˆn .

(4.9)

Let us denote the (would be) Schur operators in the ﬁrst three sub-multiplets of (4.9) as

but non-zero, we ﬁnd that the anomalous dimension of O ˆn−1 ˜O+ ˙+ is parametrically smaller
than the anomalous dimension of O′

+ ˙+.8 As a result, we see that, as claimed,

On 6= 0

∀n > 0 ,

(4.14)

As a ﬁnal aside, note that, a priori, we might have imagined that O ˆn could be identically
zero, i.e., it might not even be possible to deﬁne this operator to be in a long multiplet
as in (4.9). However, such a statement would be in contradiction with (4.13), since ˜O+ ˙+
must recombine to become part of a long multiplet for g 6= 0 (there should not be more
than one stress tensor away from the zero gauge coupling point10), and therefore O ˆn−1 ˜O+ ˙+
should also be part of a long multiplet at small (but non-zero) coupling.

Now we must use some physical intuition. Indeed, since O is an SU(2)R-charged but
U(1)R-neutral chiral operator that is not nilpotent, it is reasonable to associate a SUSY
moduli space, ˆMO ⊂ MSU (2)R, with its vevs (here MSU (2)R contains any normal directions
to generic points on ˆMO that also break SU(2)R but preserve U(1)R). Given this picture,
we expect that for generic hOi 6= 0, the IR theory is just a collection of free hypermultiplets.
In some theories, these free hypermultiplets might necessarily be accompanied by free vector

multiplets as well (see, e.g., [21]). This insight allows us to compute a bound on the value
of a4d − c4d for the isolated theory

a4d,T − c4d,T ≥ −

dimMSU (2)R .

(4.16)

Note that (4.16) follows from the deﬁnition of our moduli space: it is a space of vacua in
which (i) SU(2)R is spontaneously broken, but U(1)R is not, and (ii) at generic points, the
theory consists of a set of free hypermultiplets possibly with additional vector multiplets.
As a result, (4.16) follows from linear U(1)R ’t Hooft anomaly matching. In particular, the
above inequality is saturated if we have a genuine Higgs branch (i.e., no vector multiplets

at generic points).

8This argument can be suitably generalized if the operators in question do not have deﬁnite scaling
dimension. Indeed, since the O ˆn−1 ˜O+ ˙+ operator must become part of a short multiplet as the gauge coupling
is taken to zero, O′

+ ˙+ − O ˆn−1 ˜O+ ˙+ cannot be part of a short multiplet for suﬃciently small g.

9This result immediately implies (after invoking ﬂavor covariance) that

10We should, of course, be away from any other decoupling points as well for this statement to hold.

We can now show that, in the gauged theory, either a4d ≥ c4d along the conformal
manifold, or |χ| ≥ 3. Indeed, suppose a4d < c4d.
In this case, the gauged theory would
still possess a non-trivial moduli space of the type described above with ˆBR generators
parameterizing it. As discussed in the bullet points of the ﬁrst part of section 2, this
conclusion means we would have |χ| ≥ 3.
|χ| < 3, we must have that

In particular, if we would like a theory with

a4d ≥ c4d ,

(4.17)

along the conformal manifold.

In the rest of this sub-section, we show that |χ| ≥ 3 even in the case of a4d ≥ c4d. Note
ﬁrst that, assuming the partition function has the behavior described in [12] and (1.2), it is
straightforward to show that if a4d ≥ c4d then the Schur index lacks an essential singularity
as q → 1. Let us see if we can ﬁnd a chiral algebra with |χ| = 1 that is compatible
with this asymptotic behavior. Since the stress tensor always exists, such an algebra must

be a Virasoro algebra. If there are no null vectors (besides the trivial one involving the

derivative of the identity) in the vacuum Virasoro module, then the partition function is

I = χ(1,1) = P.E.(cid:18) q2

1 − q(cid:19) ,

where the plethystic exponential of a function of variables x1,· · · , xi is deﬁned as

P.E.(f (x1,· · · , xi)) ≡ exp  ∞
Xn=1

n−1f (xn

1 ,· · · , xn

i )! .

(4.18)

(4.19)

Therefore, (4.18) clearly has an essential singularity as q → 1. This result implies that the
corresponding Schur index also has an essentail singularity and therefore a4d < c4d.

Let us then consider cases with non-trivial null vectors. From the general formula for

the Kac determinant in (7.28) of [22] with h = 0 (since we are considering the Virasoro

vacuum representation) as well as (7.31) of that same reference, we ﬁnd that a non-trivial

null vector exists only if

c2d = 13 − 6(t + t−1) ,

t =

1 ± r

or t <

(4.20)

for integers r, s, p, and p′. Without loss of generality, we can take p, p′ > 1 relatively
prime. Note that if p and p′ have diﬀerent sign, then c2d > 0 and c4d < 0, which violates
four-dimensional unitarity. Also, if p = 1 or p′ = 1, then we have a partition function as
in (4.18). Finally, for t = 3
3 , we have that c2d = 0 and so by our discussion below
(2.3), c4d = 0 as well. However, this statement violates four-dimensional unitarity, so we
need not consider this case.

2 or t = 2

12

Now, according to (8.17) of [22] (we set the overall normalization of the character so

that the vacuum contributes unity) we have

I = χ(1,1) =

q−(p−p′)2/4pp′

(q; q) Xn∈Z(cid:16)q(2pp′n+p−p′)2/4pp′

− q(2pp′n+p+p′)2/4pp′(cid:17) ,

(4.21)

From the modular transformation properties of the vacuum character, we see that the Schur
index (4.21) behaves in the limit q ≡ e−β → 1 as

I ∼ e− 4π2
where hmin = 1−(p−p′)2
is the smallest holomorphic dimension of a primary state in the (p, p′)
minimal model (see [8] for a recent discussion of consequences of this fact in the context
of 4D/2D relations). Since p and p′ are relatively prime and t is in the range described in
(4.20), we see that pp′ ≥ 10 (pp′ = 10 in the case of the Yang-Lee model that is related
to the (A1, A2) theory). Therefore, we see that there is always an essential singularity in
(4.22) and so a4d < c4d. This inequality means that the four-dimensional theory cannot
have a4d ≥ c4d if the corresponding chiral algebra has only one generator.11

We therefore require at least one more generator to cancel the essential singularity in
the Schur index and realize a4d ≥ c4d. However, if there are only two generators, one of
them is the stress tensor and the other must be a bosonic operator. Since adding a bosonic

generator does not cancel the above essential singularity in the vacuum Virasoro character,
we conclude that a4d < c4d even in the case of |χ| = 2. Therefore, we need three or more
generators of the chiral algebra (including fermions) for the four-dimensional theory to have
a4d ≥ c4d.

4.3. The case of N = 2, 3

Let us now study the case of N = 2, 3 isolated SCFT sectors,12 Ti (i = 1,· · · , N), at g = 0
with decoupled gauge ﬁelds for a diagonal H global symmetry of the Ti. To that end,
a=1 µaI(cid:17). We claim that, in the chiral ring of the

11See [6, 11] for a discussion of four-dimensional N = 2 SCFTs whose chiral algebras are vacuum modules

of Virasoro minimal models. All of these theories have a4d < c4d.

12Note that this argument will work for any N , but we only need N = 2, 3 to complete our discussion.

13

From this result, it follows (as in the N = 1 case discussed previously) that each of the
isolated Ti SCFTs have moduli spaces, MSU (2)R, where SU(2)R is spontaneously broken
but U(1)R is not.13 The argument we used in the single sector case starting with (4.16)
(but now for all N isolated sectors) applies directly to the case of N sectors since we have
a non-trivial MSU (2)R. We again conclude that the chiral algebra must have at least three
generators.

To justify (4.23), we ﬁrst note that when we turn on small g 6= 0, only one stress tensor

multiplet remains short. This multiplet has the following Schur operator

+ ˙+ = (λ1

+)I(˜λ2 ˙+)I −

(4.25)

where (at g = 0) the J 11
i+ ˙+ are the Schur operators in the stress tensor multiplets of the
isolated Ti theories. We can form N additional linearly independent combinations of the
operators appearing on the RHS of (4.25)

˜Oa+ ˙+ = κa,λ(λ1

κa,iJ 11

(4.26) are chosen so that h ˜Oa+ ˙+(x)J 11
should only be one stress tensor multiplet, all N of the operators in (4.26) must pair up
with linearly independent combinations of the N operators Oi = µI

Therefore, to justify (4.23), we can, in analogy with the N = 1 discussion in the previous
subsection, suppose that for some particular Oi there is a minimal ˆn > 0 such that O ˆn
i = 0
in the chiral ring of the collection of the isolated Ti. Clearly, this operator is in a long
multiplet of the following type (the case in which this operator identically vanishes can be

ˆC2ˆn−2(0,0) ⊕ D2ˆn−1(0,0) ⊕ ¯D2ˆn−1(0,0) ⊕ ˆB2ˆn .

(4.27)

Now, we study the operator O ˆn−1
+ ˙+ is the appropri-
ate linear combination of the ˜Oa+ ˙+ in (4.26) that pairs up with Oi. From this discussion,

in the chiral ring of the collection of the Ti. Therefore, as discussed below (4.23), we see
that |χ| ≥ 3.

5. An example with |χ| = 3
Given the above general discussion,

it is interesting to ask if there are examples that

saturate the bound (1.1).
In this section, we will see the answer is yes by explicitly
constructing an N = 2 SCFT, ˆT , that has a one complex-dimensional conformal manifold
and whose chiral algebra, χ( ˆT ), saturates the bound (1.1).14

The theory ˆT is given by the low-energy limit of type IIB string theory on the three
complex-dimensional hypersurface singularity x3
3 + αx1x2x3 + w2 = 0 [20], or,
alternatively, by three (A1, A3) Arygres-Douglas theories whose diagonal SU(2) ﬂavor sym-
metry is gauged (Fig. 1). The central charge of the SU(2) ﬂavor symmetry of the (A1, A3)
theory [23] is precisely the right value so that this diagonal gauging is exactly marginal.
The resulting N = 2 SCFT, ˆT , has conformal anomalies a ˆT = c ˆT = 2, and therefore its

two-dimensional chiral algebra, χ( ˆT ), has

1 + x3

2 + x3

c2d = −12c ˆT = −24 .

(5.1)

14We do not consider any hypothetical isolated points on the conformal manifold at ﬁnite Zamolodchikov
distance where new Schur operators might appear. Such points would have an accidental enhancement of

the corresponding chiral algebras. No such points are known to exist in the literature, and they do not aﬀect
our discussion at generic points.

15

In order to identify this chiral algebra, let us compute the Schur index of ˆT . Since it is
invariant under the exactly marginal gauge coupling, the index can be computed in the

weak gauge coupling limit by considering the following integral

I ˆT (q) =I|z|=1

(z2 + 1 + z−2)(cid:21) ,

(5.2)

(5.3)

is the Schur index of a single SU(2) vector multiplet (recall the deﬁnition of the plethystic
exponential in (4.19)). The Schur index of the (A1, A3) theory was found in [3] to be15

I(A1,A3)(q; z) =

where J3 is the Cartan generator of su(2) normalized so that the fundamental representation

Now, by an explicit calculation, we see that the index (5.2) has the following expansion

in q

15See also [6] for an equivalent expression for the same quantity.
16Here, we use a slightly diﬀerent notation for the ﬂavor fugacity from [3]. In particular, x in Eq. (1.6)
of [3] is related to z in this paper by x = z2. In terms of z, the character of the n-dimensional representation
of su(2) is given by χn(z) = (zn − z−n)/(z − z−1). See also footnote 20 of [3].

16

We have checked the equivalence of (5.6) and (5.7) up to very high perturbative order in
q. Moreover, the expression (5.7) has no essential singularity at q → 1, which is consistent
with a ˆT = c ˆT .17

To identify χ( ˆT ), our strategy will be to show that the expression in (5.7) coincides
with the vacuum character of the A(6) algebra of Feigin, Feigin, and Tipunin [9]. The A(6)
algebra is a W algebra obtained by extending the Virasoro algebra with central charge
c = −24 by adding two Virasoro primaries, Φ±(z), of holomorphic dimension 4. Since
Φ±(z)Φ±(w) are anti-symmetric under z ↔ w, Φ± are fermionic generators. Moreover, Φ±
satisfy the following null state equations

∂2Φ± + α T Φ± = 0 ,

(5.8)

where α is a constant, and T Φ± is the normal ordered product of the stress tensor, T ,
and Φ±. The singular part of the operator product expansion of Φ+(z)Φ−(w) is given by
composite operators of the stress tensor and its derivatives. The vacuum character of this

algebra is evaluated in [9] as

ZA(6)(q, z) ≡ TrA(6) qL0z2A =

Xj=− n−1
where A is an sℓ(2) charge under which Φ± have charge ± 1
2, and the stress tensor is neutral.
Note here that, when we set z = −1, this vacuum character is equivalent to the expression
(5.7), namely

I ˆT (q) = TrA(6)(−1)2AqL0 = ZA(6)(−1, q) .

(5.10)

Since the Φ± are fermionic operators with charges 2A = ±1, and T (z) is a bosonic operator
with charge 2A = 0, the factor (−1)2A in the trace is identiﬁed with (−1)F .18 Then, the
equality (5.10) is precisely of the form of (2.6). Moreover, the central charge c = −24 of
the A(6) algebra agrees with the expected value of the central charge, c2d = −12c4d, of
χ( ˆT ). These facts strongly suggest that indeed

and that therefore, as promised,

χ( ˆT ) = A(6) ,

|χ( ˆT )| = 3 .

(5.11)

(5.12)

17The absence of the essential singularity can be seen by rewriting (5.7) using (the derivative of) Jacobi’s

triple product identity.

18From the four-dimensional perspective, we can think of the z fugacity as being related to a fugacity for

rotations in the plane normal to the chiral algebra.

5.1. Explicit check of multiplet recombination in four dimensions

In this sub-section we further check the identiﬁcation in (5.11) by explicitly constructing
the Schur operators, up to O(q4), that survive for small but non-zero gauge coupling.19 As
we will see, all chiral algebra generators of O(q4) and lower pair up to form long multiplets,
with the exception of the the SU(2)R current (at O(q2)) and the two fermionic generators
(at O(q4)). Moreover, it is straightforward to check, using the Macdonald index of the
(A1, A3) theory [5] and the Macdonald analog of (5.2), that the four-dimensional fermionic
primaries corresponding to Φ± should be of type ˆC 3
2 ) (the corresponding Schur
operators have charge ± 1
2 under M ⊥ = j1 − j2, which is in turn mapped to charge ± 1
under A in the chiral algebra).

straint in each (A1, A3) theory implies that Oaa = 0. As a result, this constraint leaves
three Oab operators with a 6= b. Using the variations in (2.8), it straightforward to check
that when we turn on a small gauge coupling, all operators in (5.13) pair up via

ˆC0(0,0) ⊕ D1(0,0) ⊕ ¯D1(0,0) ⊕ ˆB2 ,

Naively, we have twenty-six fermionic generators and twenty-seven bosonic generators.

However, six bosonic and six fermionic constraints come from applying (4.15) of [5] in each
(A1, A3) sector. In particular, we have

6. Discussion and Conclusion

In this paper, we found new connections between the conformal manifold and the moduli
space of vacua. We also saw that N = 2 theories with a ≥ c must have additional fermionic
symmetries in two dimensions (as long as the theories we study satisfy the Cardy-like scaling

in (1.2) and [12]). Finally, we demonstrated that the chiral ring—speciﬁcally the subring

that controls exactly marginal deformations—and the chiral algebra are interrelated (in

the sense that the existence of an exactly marginal gauge coupling imposes (1.1) on the

resulting chiral algebras). We suspect that there is a deeper connection and therefore

suggest the following open problems:

• All examples of chiral algebras arising from conformal manifolds seem to admit non-
trivial actions of certain Lie algebras. In the case of the Lagrangian conformal theories

this is the manifest ﬂavor symmetry in the four-dimensional description. On the other
hand, in our theory, ˆT , we had no ﬂavor symmetry in four dimensions. The two
dimensional sl(2) symmetry instead arose from the non-trivial action of the rotational

symmetry transverse to the chiral algebra plane. It would clearly be desirable to have

an explanation (or refutation) of this apparently general phenomenon.

• It follows from our work that if there is an N = 2 theory (satisfying the usual Cardy-
like scaling of (1.2) and [12]) with |χ| < 3 and an exactly marginal deformation, then
that marginal deformation would be exotic: it would not have an interpretation as a

gauge coupling.

• It would be interesting to understand if the equation ∂2Φ±+αT Φ± = 0 when acting on
fermionic sl(2) doublets, Φ±, in chiral algebras arising from four dimensions is enough
to guarantee the existence of an exactly marginal deformation in the associated four-
dimensional theory. This statement holds in the A(6) theory we studied and also in
the case of the chiral algebra corresponding to the free vector multiplet.

• Identify the natural mathematical structures associated with chiral algebras coming

from conformal manifolds in four dimensions.
